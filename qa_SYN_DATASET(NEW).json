            "judgement":"ASHOK BHUSHAN,J.\r\n        Leave granted.\r\n        2. This appeal has been filed against the judgment of the High Court of Uttarakhand dated\r\n        27.09.2019, by which judgment High Court had dismissed the Criminal Revision filed by the\r\n        appellants. The Criminal Revision was filed by the appellants against the order dated 17.08.2019\r\n        passed by Additional District Judge, Laksar, by which the appellants were summoned by the Court\r\n        under Section 319 Cr.P.C.\r\n        3. Brief facts of the case necessary to be noted for deciding this appeal are:-\r\n        i. The appellant was made an accused in FIR No.175\/2015 at Police Station Kotwali,\r\n        Laksar, Haridwar, under Section 147, 148, 149, 323, 324, 307, 452, 504 and 506 IPC\r\n        along with six other accused.\r\n        An FIR No.176\/2016 was also registered in the same Police Station under Section\r\n        147, 148, 149, 307, 452, 504, 506 IPC in which the complainant with other accused\r\n        were arrayed. The Police after carrying out the investigation submitted a chargesheet\r\n        exonerating the appellants. Investigation officer after investigation expunged the\r\n        names of Bittoo and Jyoti, the appellants from the list of accused from the\r\n        chargesheet.\r\n        ii. The Trial began in case No.228 of 2016 in which informant Pahal Singh was\r\n        examined as PW-1. In his Statement, Pahal Singh implicated all accused including\r\n        the appellants but no specific role was assigned to the appellants. Statement was also\r\n        recorded by PW-2, Monu, in which he implicated the appellants. An application\r\n        under Section 319 Cr.P.C. was filed by the informant before the Session Judge\r\n        praying that appellant be also summoned in the case.\r\n        Learned Session Judge after noticing in detail the statements made by PW-1 and\r\n        PW-2 made in the Court rejected the application by order dated 21.06.2018. Against\r\n        the order dated 21.06.2018, Pahal Singh, the informant, filed the Criminal Revision\r\n        No.304 of 2018 before the High Court.\r\n        iii. The High Court relying on the judgment of this Court reported in Rajesh and\r\n        others versus State of Haryana, (2019) 6 SCC 368, allowed the Revision and directed\r\n        the application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. to be considered afresh. Following is the\r\n        operative portion of the order passed by the High Court in paragraph 7;\r\n        \u201C7. After having considered the aforesaid ratio and also the reasons which have been\r\n        assigned by the Additional Sessions Judge, Laksar, Haridwar, this Court is of the view\r\n        that the revision deserves to be allowed and the same is consequently allowed. The\r\n        order dated 21.06.2018 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Laksar,\r\n        District Haridwar in Sessions Trial No.228 of 2016, State v. Chandra Pal and others is\r\n        quashed. The matter is remitted back to the Additional Sessions Judge, Laksar,\r\n        District Haridwar, to reconsider the application paper No.53 (ka\/1) in the light of\r\n        ratio as propounded by the Hon\u2019ble Apex Courts Judgment in Rajesh\u2019 case (Supra).\u201D\r\n        iv. After the Order of the High Court dated 11.07.2019 in the Criminal Revision,\r\n        Learned Session Judge again considered the application under Section 319 Cr.P.C.\r\n        Learned Session Judge referring to the observations made by the High Court in\r\n        paragraph 5 as well as the judgment of this Court in Rajesh and others versus State of\r\n        Haryana(Supra) allowed the application and summoned the appellants by Order\r\n        dated 17.08.2019. The Trial Court issued a bailable warrant against the appellants on\r\n        05.09.2019 and after bailable warrant being served when they did not appear on\r\n        18.09.2019, Non-Bailable warrant was issued to the appellants and a Notice under \r\n        Section 446 Cr.P.C. was issued as to why the amount of sureties being not realised\r\n        from two sureties Arun Kumar and Chandra Pal. The appellants filed Criminal\r\n        Revision before the High Court against the order dated 17.08.2019 of the Additional\r\n        Session Judge summoning them.\r\n        v. The High Court dismissed the Revision noticing a subsequent order dated 18.09.2019 by which\r\n        notice has been issued under Section 446 Cr.P.C. The High Court took the view that the Revision\r\n        was filed on 23.09.2019 but the order passed by the Court on 18.09.2019 has not been brought on\r\n        record, hence, there is concealment of not placing the order on record. The High Court further\r\n        observed that since the proceeding in pursuance to allowing the application under Section 319\r\n        Cr.P.C. has already been initiated, in which the revisionists have already invoked the jurisdiction of\r\n        the Revisional Court in which order dated 18.09.2019 has been passed, the Revision is to be\r\n        dismissed. Aggrieved by the order of the High Court dated 27.09.2019, this appeal has been filed.\r\n        4. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.\r\n        5. The principles for exercise of power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. by Criminal Court are well settled.\r\n        The Constitution Bench of this Court in Hardeep Singh versus State of Punjab and others, (2014) 3\r\n        SCC 92, has elaborately considered all contours of Section 319 Cr.P.C. This Court has held that\r\n        Power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. is a discretionary and extra-ordinary power which has to be\r\n        exercised sparingly. This Court further held that the test that has to be applied is one which is more\r\n        than prima facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an\r\n        extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to conviction. In paragraph 105 and 106,\r\n        following has been laid down: -\r\n        \u201C105. Power under Section 319 CrPC is a discretionary and an extraordinary power. It\r\n        is to be exercised sparingly and only in those cases where the circumstances of the\r\n        case so warrant. It is not to be exercised because the Magistrate or the Sessions Judge\r\n        is of the opinion that some other person may also be guilty of committing that\r\n        offence. Only where strong and cogent evidence occurs against a person from the\r\n        evidence led before the Court that such power should be exercised and not in a casual\r\n        and cavalier manner.\r\n        106. Thus, we hold that though only a prima facie case is to be established from the\r\n        evidence led before the court, not necessarily tested on the anvil of\r\n        cross-examination, it requires much stronger evidence than mere probability of his\r\n        complicity. The test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie case\r\n        as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent\r\n        that the evidence, if goes un-rebutted, would lead to conviction. In the absence of\r\n        such satisfaction, the court should refrain from exercising power under Section 319\r\n        CrPC. In Section 319 CrPC the purpose of providing if \u201Cit appears from the evidence\r\n        that any person not being the accused has committed any offence\u201D is clear from the\r\n        words \u201Cfor which such person could be tried together with the accused.\u201D The words\r\n        used are not \u201Cfor which such person could be convicted\u201D. There is, therefore, no scope\r\n        for the court acting under Section 319 CrPC to form any opinion as to the guilt of the\r\n        accused.\u201D\r\n        6. The Two-Judge Bench of this Court again reiterated the same ratio in Rajesh and others versus\r\n        State of Haryana (Supra) which judgment has also been relied by the High Court in the impugned\r\n        judgment.\r\n        7. Now we may notice the reason which persuaded the High Court to reject the Revision. After\r\n        noticing the facts of the case, the High Court proceeded to consider the revision and recorded its\r\n        reason for dismissing it in following words: -\r\n        \u201CAlthough a reference has been made in paragraph 10 of the application filed in\r\n        support of the revision to the effect that the proceedings was taken by the present\r\n        revisionists before the Sessions Court and an order of 18.09.2019 has been passed,\r\n        whereby, the notices have been issued to the present revisionists under Section 446\r\n        of Cr.P.C.\r\n        This order passed by the Court below is that of 18.09.2019. the copy of the said order\r\n        was received by the revisionists on 21.09.2019, as would be apparent from the folio\r\n        annexed with the certified copy of the order dated 18.09.2019 as supplied by the\r\n        learned counsel for the revisionist during the course of arguments to this Court,\r\n        though it is not part of the Criminal Revision.\r\n        The revision itself was filed on 23.09.2019. The said order passed by the Court under Section 446,\r\n        has not been brought on record. Hence, this Court is of the view that apart from the fact that there is\r\n        a concealment by not placing the order on record, which otherwise has been procured by the\r\n        revisionist prior to the filing of the revision and furthermore, since the proceedings in pursuance to\r\n        allowing the application under Section 319 CrPC has already been initiated, in which the revisionist\r\n        has already invoked the jurisdiction of the Revisional court, in which the order dated 18.09.2019 has\r\n        been passed.\r\n        In view of the already ongoing proceedings before the Sessions Court prior to the filing of the\r\n        present revision, this court is of the view that no simultaneous challenge to the impugned order\r\n        dated 17.08.2019 summoning the revisionists under Section 319 of CrPC would be tenable before\r\n        this Court till the order dated 18.09.2019, passed in the proceedings at the behest of the present\r\n        revisionist, subsist.\r\n        Consequently, this revision lacks merit and the same is dismissed as it is not sustainable before this\r\n        Court.\u201D\r\n        8. A perusal of the judgment of the High Court indicates that the High Court did not examine the\r\n        correctness of the order dated 17.08.2019 by which the appellants were summoned by Additional\r\n        District Judge under Section 319 Cr.P.C., rather has dismissed the Criminal Revision on basis of a\r\n        subsequent fact i.e. order dated 18.09.2019 by which notice has been issued under Section 446 Cr.P.C. The High Court further took the view that since the proceedings in pursuance of Section 319\r\n        Cr.P.C. have already been initiated and that no simultaneous challenge to the impugned order dated\r\n        17.08.2019 summoning the revisionists under Section 319 Cr.P.C. would be tenable before the High\r\n        Court till the order dated 18.09.2019 passed in proceedings at the behest of revisionist subsist.\r\n        9. We may now notice the nature of the proceedings subsequent to the order dated 17.08.2019 by\r\n        which the appellants were summoned. The appellant has brought on record the order sheet of the\r\n        Court along with the application for additional documents. The order sheet indicates that although\r\n        the summons was served on the appellants but they have not appeared, hence, bailable warrant of\r\n        Rs.10,000\/- was issued against the appellants. Order dated 05.09.2019 is to the following effect:-\r\n        \u201C Sd\/- illegible 05.09.2019 Arun Kumar Chandrapal Record is produced. Accused\r\n        Sandeep Singh appearance dispensed through his Jitender counsel Kashim Ansari.\r\n        Allowed. Gautam Remaining accused Arun, Chandrapal, Jitender and Gautam are\r\n        present.\r\n        Summon is duly served on accused Jyoti and Bittu. Accused Jyoti and Bittu are\r\n        absent. The bailable warrant of Rs.10,000\/- be issue against Jyoti and Bittu for\r\n        18.09.2019.\r\n        Sd\/- illegible\r\n        Ambika Pant\r\n        Additional Session Judge Laksar,\r\n        District Haridwar.\u201D\r\n        10. Subsequently on 18.09.2019 the case was again taken by the Additional District\r\n        Judge and following order was passed:-\r\n        Sd\/- illegible 18.09.2019 Arun Kumar Chandrapal The file is produced. Accused\r\n        Singh Chandrapal Gautam, Jitender and Jitender Sandeep are present.\r\n        Gautam The Bailable warrants issued against accused Jyoti and Bittu are returned\r\n        after being served. Accused Jyoti and Bittu are absent even after service of Bailable\r\n        warrants. Therefore, non bailable warrants are issued against Jyoti and Bittu to\r\n        ensure their presence.\r\n        Accused Jyoti and Bittu are not being produced before the Court inspite of sureties\r\n        given by the guarantors. The surety of accused Bittu is Accused Arun Kumar and the\r\n        surety of accused Jyoti is her father accused Chandrapal and the another surety is\r\n        accused Arun. Both of them are present in the Court.\r\n        Therefore, the Bail bonds executed by them are forfeited for not producing Accused\r\n        Bittu and Jyoti before the Court. Therefore, notice under section 446 CrPC is being\r\n        issued with the intent that why the amount if surety be not realized from them.\r\n        The case be produced for appearance of accused Jyoti and Bittu and for the\r\n        explanation by the guarantors on 30.09.2019.\r\n        Sd\/- illegible Ambika Pant Additional Session Judge Laksar, District Haridwar.\u201D\r\n        11. The proceedings which were taken on 05.09.2019 and 18.09.2019 are proceedings\r\n        consequent to and subsequent to the order dated 17.08.2019. The subsequent\r\n        proceeding in no manner can be a ground to not consider the correctness and validity\r\n        of order dated 17.08.2019. We are of the considered opinion that the High Court\r\n        completely erred in refusing to consider the correctness of the order dated 17.08.2019\r\n        on the ground that on 18.09.2019 notice under Section 446 Cr.P.C. has been issued.\r\n        As and when it is found that order dated 17.08.2019 could not have been passed in\r\n        exercise of jurisdiction under Section 319 Cr.P.C., all subsequent proceedings thereto\r\n        shall automatically come to an end.\r\n        12. The view of the High Court which is recorded in following words:-\r\n        \u201C\u2026this court is of the view that no simultaneous challenge to the impugned order\r\n        dated 17.08.2019 summoning the revisionists under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. would be\r\n        tenable before this Court till the order dated 18.09.2019, passed in the proceedings at\r\n        the behest of present revisionist, subsist.\u201D cannot be said to be correct view.\r\n        13. The order dated 18.09.2019 by which the Court has directed appearance of the\r\n        accused appellant is to be taken to its logical end but that order cannot provide a\r\n        shield of protection to earlier order dated 17.08.2019 by which appellant has been\r\n        summoned.\r\n        14. The subsequent proceedings of the court which have been brought on record\r\n        indicate that the appellant no.2 and 1 have appeared before the Court and have also\r\n        been granted bail. .\r\n        15. One of the grounds taken in this appeal is that appellant No.1 is Juvenile at the\r\n        date of incident, his Date of Birth being 01.04.2000. The above ground also needs to\r\n        be considered by the High Court.\r\n        16. We thus are of the view that the impugned judgment of the High Court dated\r\n        27.09.2019 is unsustainable and deserves to be set aside. We order accordingly. The\r\n        Criminal Revision of the appellants be considered afresh by the High Court in\r\n        accordance with the law. The appeal is allowed.",

That the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, 43 rd Court, Borivali, Mumbai directed\r\nto issue process against both the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 138 r\/w Section\r\n141 of the NI Act. 2.1 That, thereafter, the appellant herein \u2013 original accused No. 2, wife of the\r\noriginal accused No. 1 filed Criminal Writ Petition No. 2595 of 2019 in the High Court to quash the\r\ncriminal complaint filed against her mainly on the ground that the appellant was neither a signatory\r\nto the cheque dishonoured nor there was a joint bank account.\r\n2.2 It was further submitted that the appellant cannot be prosecuted for the offence punishable\r\nunder Sections 138 r\/w Section 141 of the NI Act. 2.3 However, it was the case on behalf of the\r\noriginal complainant that it was the joint liability of both the accused Nos. 1 and 2 to pay the\r\nprofessional bill as the original complainant represented both the accused and therefore considering\r\nSection 141 of the NI Act, the appellant herein \u2013 original accused No. 2 is also liable for the offence\r\npunishable under Section 138 r\/w Section 141 of the NI Act. 2.4 By the impugned judgment and\r\norder, the High Court has refused to quash the criminal complaint filed against the appellant, giving\r\nrise to the present appeal.\r\n3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently submitted that the\r\ndishonoured cheque was issued by her husband and not the appellant and even the account in\r\nquestion was not a joint account and that the appellant was neither the signatory to the cheque nor\r\nthe cheque was drawn from the bank account of the appellant and therefore the appellant cannot be\r\nprosecuted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act. It is vehemently submitted\r\nthat the ingredients of Section 138 of the NI Act are not satisfied, and therefore, the High Court\r\nought to have quashed the criminal complaint against the appellant.\r\n3.1 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that, in the\r\nfacts and circumstances of the case, even Section 141 of the NI Act shall not be applicable as the\r\ncheque was issued by a private individual.\r\n4. The present appeal is vehemently opposed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\r\nrespondent No. 1 \u2013 original complainant.\r\n4.1 It is submitted that the liability to pay the debt towards the professional bill was the joint liability\r\nof both the accused as the complainant represented both the accused and, therefore, as rightly\r\nobserved and held by the High Court, Section 141 of the NI Act shall be applicable.\r\n4.2 It is submitted that when the Trial Court issued the summons against the appellant for the\r\noffence punishable under Section 138 r\/w Section 141 of the NI Act after having come to the\r\nconclusion that a prima facie case has been made out, the High Court has rightly refused to quash\r\nthe criminal complaint. 4.3 It is further submitted that as the cheque was issued towards discharge\r\nof legal liability of both the accused and thereafter when her husband issued the cheque, the High\r\nCourt has rightly refused to quash the complaint.\r\n5. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State has supported the impugned judgment and\r\norder passed by the High Court.\r\n6. We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length, considered\r\nmaterial on record and also considered the averments and allegations in the complaint. It emerges\r\nfrom the record that the dishonoured cheque was issued by original accused No. 1 \u2013 husband of the\r\nappellant. It was drawn from the bank account of original accused No. 1. The dishonoured cheque\r\nwas signed by original accused No. 1. Therefore, the dishonoured cheque was signed by original\r\naccused No. 1 and it was drawn on the bank account of original accused No. 1. The appellant\r\nherein-original accused No. 2 is neither the signatory to the cheque nor the dishonoured cheque was\r\ndrawn from her bank account. That the account in question was not a joint account. In the light of\r\nthe aforesaid facts, it is required to be considered whether the appellant herein \u2013 original accused\r\nNo. 2 can be prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section 138 r\/w Section 141 of the NI Act?\r\n7. On a fair reading of Section 138 of the NI Act, before a person can be prosecuted, the following\r\nconditions are required to be satisfied:\r\ni) that the cheque is drawn by a person and on an account maintained by him with a\r\nbanker;\r\nii) for the payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that\r\naccount for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability; and\r\niii) the said cheque is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of\r\nmoney standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or\r\nthat it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account.\r\nTherefore, a person who is the signatory to the cheque and the cheque is drawn by that person on an\r\naccount maintained by him and the cheque has been issued for the discharge, in whole or in part, ofcan be said to have committed an offence. Section 138 of the NI Act does not speak about the joint\r\nliability. Even in case of a joint liability, in case of individual persons, a person other than a person\r\nwho has drawn the cheque on an account maintained by him, cannot be prosecuted for the offence\r\nunder Section 138 of the NI Act. A person might have been jointly liable to pay the debt, but if such a\r\nperson who might have been liable to pay the debt jointly, cannot be prosecuted unless the bank\r\naccount is jointly maintained and that he was a signatory to the cheque.\r\n8. Now, so far as the case on behalf of the original complainant that the appellant herein \u2013 original\r\naccused No. 2 can be convicted with the aid of Section 141 of the NI Act is concerned, the aforesaid\r\nhas no substance. 8.1 Section 141 of the NI Act is relating to the offence by companies and it cannot\r\nbe made applicable to the individuals. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original\r\ncomplainant has submitted that \u201CCompany\u201D means any body corporate and includes, a firm or other\r\nassociation of individuals and therefore in case of a joint liability of two or more persons it will fall\r\nwithin \u201Cother association of individuals\u201D and therefore with the aid of Section 141 of the NI Act, the\r\nappellant who is jointly liable to pay the debt, can be prosecuted. The aforesaid cannot be accepted.\r\nTwo private individuals cannot be said to be \u201Cother association of individuals\u201D. Therefore, there is no\r\nquestion of invoking Section 141 of the NI Act against the appellant, as the liability is the individual\r\nliability (may be a joint liabilities), but cannot be said to be the offence committed by a company or\r\nby it corporate or firm or other associations of individuals. The appellant herein is neither a Director\r\nnor a partner in any firm who has issued the cheque. Therefore, even the appellant cannot be\r\nconvicted with the aid of Section 141 of the NI Act. Therefore, the High Court has committed a grave\r\nerror in not quashing the complaint against the appellant for the offence punishable under Section\r\n138 r\/w Section 141 of the NI Act. The criminal complaint filed against the appellant for the offence\r\npunishable under Section 138 r\/w Section 141 of the NI Act, therefore, can be said to be abuse of\r\nprocess of law and therefore the same is required to be quashed and set aside.\r\n8. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal succeeds. The impugned\r\njudgment and order dated 21.08.2019 passed by the High Court in Criminal Writ Petition No. 2595\r\nof 2019 refusing to quash the criminal complaint against the appellant for the offence punishable\r\nunder Section 138 read with Section 141 of the NI Act is hereby quashed and set aside. The\r\ncomplaint case pending in the Court of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate filed by respondent No.\r\n1 \u2013 original complainant being C.C. No. 2802\/SS\/2016 is hereby quashed and set aside. The appeal\r\nis allowed accordingly.",

            "judgement":"Rastogi, J.\r\n1. Leave granted.\r\n2. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.\r\n3. 14:59:07 IST Reason: The instant appeal has been filed on behalf of accused no.\r\n6(Ashim @ Asim Kumar Haranath Bhattacharya) out of the total number of 14 accused persons\r\nseeking post arrest bail which came to be rejected by the learned trial Court by Order dated 25 th\r\nFebruary, 2020 and also by the High Court by Order dated 15 th March, 2021.\r\n4. The FIR No. 138\/2012 dated 1 st March, 2012 was initially lodged under Sections 120B, 121, 121A,\r\n122 of the IPC, Section 25(1A) of the Arms Act, 1959 and Section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act,1908 against five accused persons by a de\u2212facto complainant who is an Inspector, Special Task\r\nForce. Later, the National Investigation Agency took over the investigation. The said case was re\u2212\r\nregistered as RC No. 01\/2012\/NIA\/DLI at PS NIA Headquarters, New Delhi for offences under\r\nSections 120B, 121, 121A, 122 IPC, Section 25(1A) of the Arms Act 1959, Section 5 of the Explosive\r\nSubstances Act, 1908 and Sections 18,20,40(1)(b)(c) of the Unlawful Activities(Prevention) Act,\r\n1967(hereinafter being referred to as \u201CUAP Act\u201D) on 12th April, 2012.\r\n5. After investigation, the charge sheet was initially filed against A\u22121 to A\u22125 on 23rd August, 2012\r\nand thereafter the first supplementary charge sheet was filed on 27 th December, 2012 against A\u22126\r\nto A\u22129 in which the appellant was named as A\u22126 and the second supplementary charge sheet was\r\nfiled on 3 rd July, 2017 against another 5 accused persons. The said accused persons are presently\r\nabsconding. The charges later came to be framed on 20 th June, 2019 for offences under Sections\r\n121, 121A, 122, 120B IPC and under Sections 25(1)(a), 25(1A), 25(1\u2212AA) of Arms Act, 1959 and under\r\nSections 18 and 20 of the UAP Act. At this stage, PW 1 who is the de\u2212facto complainant, his cross\u2212\r\nexamination has been going on for quite a long time and still it has not been completed.\r\n6. The appellant was arrested on 6th July, 2012 on the basis of a production warrant sent to Nagpur\r\nCentral Jail, Maharashtra. The appellant was in jail earlier in connection with another case(FIR No.\r\n28\/2007 dated 11th May, 2007)in which he was acquitted by the competent Court of jurisdiction by\r\na judgment dated 15 th February, 2014.\r\n7. It has come on record that there are 298 prosecution witnesses in the calendar of witnesses as\r\nreferred to in the charge sheet but it has been stated in the counter affidavit filed by the respondent\r\nthat the prosecution in all likelihood may examine only 100 to 105 prosecution witnesses.\r\n8. The charges against the accused appellant are undoubtedly serious but the charges will have to be\r\nbalanced with certain other factors like the period of incarceration which the appellant has\r\nundergone and the likelihood period within which the trial can be expected to be finally concluded.\r\nThat apart, the appellant is 74 years of age.\r\n9. Learned counsel for the respondent vehemently opposed the appeal filed by the accused appellant\r\nseeking post arrest bail and submits that the delay is in no manner be attributable to the prosecution\r\nand this Court may direct the trial Court to take up the case on day\u2212to\u2212day basis and conclude the\r\ntrial at the earliest.\r\n10. That the requirement of law as being envisaged under Section 19 of the National Investigation\r\nAgency Act, 2008(hereinafter being referred to as \u201CAct 2008\u201D) mandates that the trial under the Act\r\nof any offence by a Special Court shall be held on day\u2212to\u2212day basis on all working days and have\r\nprecedence over the trial of any other case and Special Courts are to be designated for such an\r\noffence by the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court as\r\ncontemplated under Section 11 of the Act 2008 but the ground realities are totally different as in the\r\ninstant case, after the charge\u2212sheets came to be filed way back in 2012, the charges have been\r\nframed after 7 years of filing of the charge\u2212sheet on 20th June, 2019.11. We have to balance the nature of crime in reference to which the appellant is facing a trial. At the\r\nsame time, the period of incarceration which has been suffered and the likely period within which\r\nthe trial can be expected to be completed, as is informed to this Court that the statement of PW\u2212\r\n1\/de\u2212facto complainant has still not been completed and there are 298 prosecution witnesses in the\r\ncalendar of witness although the respondent has stated in its counter affidavit that it may examine\r\nonly 100 to 105 witnesses but indeed may take its own time to conclude the trial. This fact certainly\r\ncannot be ignored that the appellant is in custody since 6 th July, 2012 and has completed nine and\r\nhalf years of incarceration as an undertrial prisoner.\r\n12. This Court has consistently observed in its numerous judgments that the liberty guaranteed in\r\nPart III of the Constitution would cover within its protective ambit not only due procedure and\r\nfairness but also access to justice and a speedy trial is imperative and the undertrials cannot\r\nindefinitely be detained pending trial. Once it is obvious that a timely trial would not be possible and\r\nthe accused has suffered incarceration for a significant period of time, the Courts would ordinarily\r\nbe obligated to enlarge him on bail.\r\n13. Deprivation of personal liberty without ensuring speedy trial is not consistent with Article 21 of\r\nthe Constitution of India. While deprivation of personal liberty for some period may not be\r\navoidable, period of deprivation pending trial\/appeal cannot be unduly long. At the same time,\r\ntimely delivery of justice is part of human rights and denial of speedy justice is a threat to public\r\nconfidence in the administration of justice.\r\n14. The three\u2212Judge Bench of this Court in Union of India Vs. K.A. Najeeb 2021(3) SCC 713 had an\r\noccasion to consider the long incarceration and at the same time the effect of Section 43\u2212D(5) of the\r\nUAP Act and observed as under:\u2212\r\n17. It is thus clear to us that the presence of statutory restrictions like Section 43\u2212D(5) of the UAPA\r\nper se does not oust the ability of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of\r\nPart III of the Constitution. Indeed, both the restrictions under a statute as well as the powers\r\nexercisable under constitutional jurisdiction can be well harmonised. Whereas at commencement of\r\nproceedings, the courts are expected to appreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail but the\r\nrigours of such provisions will melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed\r\nwithin a reasonable time and the period of incarceration already undergone has exceeded a\r\nsubstantial part of the prescribed sentence. Such an approach would safeguard against the\r\npossibility of provisions like Section 43\u2212D(5) of the UAPA being used as the sole metric for denial of\r\nbail or for wholesale breach of constitutional right to speedy trial.\r\n15. In the above circumstances, we are of the view that the appellant accused has made out a case for\r\ngrant of post\u2212arrest bail pending trial.\r\n16. Before parting with the order, we would like to observe that under the scheme of the Act 2008,\r\nthe power is vested with the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High\r\nCourt, for the trial of scheduled offences, designate one or more Courts of Session as Special Courts,\r\nby notification in the Official Gazette, with the place of jurisdiction of special Courts and itsjurisdictional power has been defined under Sections 13 and 14 of the Act 2008. At the same time, it\r\nhas been mandated under Section 19 of the Act 2008 that the trial under the Act of any offence by a\r\nSpecial Court shall be held on day\u2212to\u2212day basis on all working days and shall be concluded in\r\npreference to the trial of such other case and accordingly the trial of such other case shall, if\r\nnecessary, remain in abeyance. The power of State Government to designate one or more Courts as\r\nSpecial Courts for the trial of offences under any or all the enactments specified in the Schedule is\r\nprovided under Section 22 of the Act, 2008.\r\n17. It has been informed to this Court that only one such Special Court has been designated by the\r\nState of West Bengal to try such cases under the Act 2008. Before us, the order sheets have been\r\nplaced for perusal of the instant case and it indicates that hearing is taking place only one day in a\r\nmonth and if this procedure is being followed in conducting the trial under Act 2008, it frustrates\r\nthe very purpose with which the special Courts are designated.\r\n18. It is clearly demonstrated from the instant case that after the charge\u2212sheet came to be filed in\r\nthe year 2012, charges have been framed in June 2019 and looking to the voluminous record and\r\nnumber of the prosecution witnesses which are to be examined, it may take its own time to conclude\r\nand indeed the undertrial prisoner cannot be detained for such a long period of incarceration\r\nnoticed by us in the instant case. The correspondence which has taken place between the Central\r\nGovernment and the State of West Bengal from time to time is placed for our perusal but nothing\r\nelicits from the record.\r\n19. In the given circumstances, we consider it appropriate to direct that the State of West Bengal\r\nshall take up the issue and designate more dedicated courts of Sessions as Special Courts for the trial\r\nof offences specified in the schedule appended to the Act 2008. At the same time, the Central\r\nGovernment may also, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court, Calcutta may\r\nexercise its power and take up the issue at the earliest so that such trials which are pending under\r\nthe Act 2008 may go ahead speedily and the mandate, as intended by the legislature in its wisdom,\r\nreflected from Section 19 of the Act, is being complied with in its letter and spirit.\r\n20. We accordingly direct that the accused appellant be produced before the trial Court within three\r\ndays and shall be released on post\u2212arrest bail by the learned trial Court. We also make it clear that\r\nthe learned trial Court will be at liberty to consider and impose appropriate conditions subject to\r\nwhich the appellant accused will be released on bail so as to ensure that the appellant accused is\r\navailable for trial in terms of the present order.\r\n21. Consequently, in light of the above, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of the High\r\nCourt is set aside.\r\n22. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.\r\n23. Copy of this order be sent to Chief Secretary, State of West Bengal and Registrar of the High\r\nCourt of Calcutta for necessary compliance\"",

            "judgement":"Hrishikesh Roy, J.\r\nLeave granted.\r\n2. Heard Ms. Sunieta Ojha, the learned counsel for the appellant (plaintiff). Also heard Mr.\r\nRameshwar Singh Malik, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents (defendants).\r\n3. The appellant Ashok Kumar filed CS No. 53\/2013 seeking declaration of ownership of property,\r\nleft behind by late Trilok Chand Gupta and late Sona Devi. He arrayed the couple\u2019s three daughters\r\nas defendants in the Suit and claimed himself to be the son of Trilok Chand Gupta and Sona Devi. In\r\ntheir written statement, the defendants denied that the plaintiff is the son of their parents (Trilok\r\nChand Gupta and Sona Devi), and as such he is disentitled from any share in their parental\r\nproperty. The defendants also set up an exclusive claim on the property based on the Will dated\r\n16.4.1982 (registered on 25.4.1982) executed by their late mother Sona Devi.\r\n4. In course of the proceedings before the learned Addl. Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Kalka, on closure\r\nof the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, when the suit was slated for the other side\u2019s evidence, the defendants filed\r\nan application on 19.4.2017 seeking direction from the Court to conduct a Deoxyribonucleic Acid\r\nTest (for short \u201CDNA test\u201D) of the plaintiff and either of the defendants, to establish a biological link of the plaintiff to the defendants parents i.e. late Trilok Chand Gupta and Smt. Sona Devi.This\r\napplication was opposed by the plaintiff with the projection that the defendants\u2019 application is an\r\nabuse of the process of law and that there are adequate evidences placed before the Court by the\r\nplaintiff to show that he is the son of Trilok Chand Gupta and Sona Devi. The plaintiff in his\r\nopposition had specifically pleaded that the mother of the plaintiff and the defendants had\r\nsubmitted sworn affidavit before the Municipal Committee, Kalka to transfer the Property No. 496,\r\nPahari Bazar, Kalka in her name, mentioning the name of the plaintiff as her son. The copy of the\r\nconcerned affidavit was duly placed on record in the suit proceedings. Similarly, sworn affidavits of\r\nthe three defendants regarding transfer of the property No. 496, Pahari Bazar, Kalka, where again\r\nthe plaintiff was admitted to be the son of late Trilok Chand Gupta and late Smt. Sona Devi, were\r\nalso brought on record in the suit. With such projection of admission on his linkage to the\r\ndefendants\u2019 parents, the plaintiff opposed the DNA test suggested in the defendants\u2019 application and\r\noffered to rely on the already adduced evidence to prove his case.\r\n5. The defendants\u2019 application for conducting the DNA test for the plaintiff (at the cost of the\r\ndefendants) was disposed of by the Court by referring to the fact that the CS No. 53\/2013 is for\r\ndeclaration of ownership of property left behind by late Trilok Chand Gupta and late Sona Devi\r\nwhere the defendants have denied that the plaintiff is their brother or the son of their parents. The\r\nlearned Judge noted that the evidence was already led by the plaintiff to prove his case and the\r\napplication of the defendants was filed at that stage of the Suit when it was their turn to lay their\r\nevidence. Taking these aspects into account, the Court opined that onus is on the plaintiff to prove\r\nthat he is a coparcener amongst the defendants by way of his birth in their family and such burden\r\ndoes not shift to the defendants. Since the plaintiff had refused to give the DNA sample, the view\r\ntaken was that the Court cannot force the plaintiff to provide DNA sample and accordingly the\r\ndefendants\u2019 application came to be dismissed by the order dated 28.11.2017 by the learned Trial\r\nJudge.\r\n6. Thus aggrieved, the defendants moved the High Court by filing a Revision Petition against the\r\norder dated 28.11.2017. The parties were heard and the learned judge upon due consideration\r\nobserved that a DNA test is a double\r\n-edged weapon and is a vital test to determine the relation of a party and the plaintiff who is\r\nclaiming to be the son of late Trilok Chand Gupta and Sona Devi, should not shy away from the DNA\r\ntest suggested by the defendants. The plea for conducting the DNA test on the plaintiff was\r\naccordingly allowed by interfering with the contrary view taken by the trial Court. Taking exception\r\nto the revisional order of the High Court, the aggrieved plaintiff is before this Court.\r\n7. The pleadings were exchanged quite early in the Civil Suit No. 53\/2013, but only after closure of\r\nthe plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendants filed application on 19.4.2017 for subjecting the plaintiff to a\r\nDNA test. The question therefore is, whether in a declaratory suit where ownership over\r\ncoparcenary property is claimed, the plaintiff, against his wishes, can be subjected to the DNA test.\r\nThe related question is whether the plaintiff without subjecting himself to a DNA test, is entitled to\r\nestablish his right over the property in question, through other material evidence. The timing of the\r\napplication is equally relevant. The plaintiff has already led evidence from his side to prove relationship between the parties and at this stage whether the High Court should have directed the\r\nplaintiff to undergo the DNA test. Another issue of concern is whether in the absence of consent, a\r\nparty can be forced to provide sample for a DNA test.\r\n8. This court in Banarsi Dass V. Teeku Dutta1 had declared that DNA test is not to be directed as a\r\nmatter of routine but only in deserving cases. A petition was filed in that case for grant of succession\r\ncertificate in respect of properties of the deceased. The Plaintiff claimed to be the deceased\u2019s\r\ndaughter and the only Class 1 legal heir, under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The deceased had\r\ndied intestate, leaving behind 5 brothers. The Delhi High Court denied one of the brother\u2019s\r\napplications for conducting the DNA test of the daughter to establish her paternity. Justice Arijit\r\nPasayat upheld the decision of the High Court in the following passage of the judgment: -\r\n\u201C10. In matters of this kind the court must have regard to Section 112 of the Evidence\r\nAct. This section is based on the well-known maxim pater is est quem nuptiae\r\ndemonstrant (he is the father whom the marriage indicates). The presumption of\r\nlegitimacy is this, that a child born of a married woman is deemed to be legitimate, it\r\nthrows on the person who is interested in making out the illegitimacy, the whole\r\nburden of proving it. The law presumes both that a marriage ceremony is valid, and\r\nthat every person is legitimate. Marriage or filiation (parentage) may be presumed,\r\nthe law in general presuming against vice and immorality.\u201D 1 2005(4) SCC 449\r\n9. In Bhabani Prasad Jena vs. Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women &Anr.2,\r\nJustice R.M. Lodha, while reconciling two earlier decisions of this Court on the point, had rightfully\r\nprescribed that;\r\n\u201C23. There is no conflict in the two decisions of this Court, namely, Goutam Kundu [(1993) 3 SCC\r\n418 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 928] and Sharda [(2003) 4 SCC 493] . In Goutam Kundu [(1993) 3 SCC 418 :\r\n1993 SCC (Cri) 928] it has been laid down that courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter of\r\ncourse and such prayers cannot be granted to have roving inquiry; there must be strong prima facie\r\ncase and the court must carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of ordering the\r\nblood test. In Sharda [(2003) 4 SCC 493] while concluding that a matrimonial court has power to\r\norder a person to undergo a medical test, it was reiterated that the court should exercise such a\r\npower if the applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is sufficient material before the court.\r\nObviously, therefore, any order for DNA test can be given by the court only if a strong prima facie\r\ncase is made out for such a course.\u201D The learned Judge while noting the sensitivities involved with\r\nthe issue of ordering a DNA test, opined that the discretion of the court must be exercised after\r\nbalancing the interests of the parties and whether a DNA 2(2010) 8 SCC 633 Test is needed for a just\r\ndecision in the matter and such a direction satisfies the test of \u201Ceminent need\u201D.\r\n10. The above decision in Bhabani Prasad Jena (supra) was considered and approved in Dipanwita\r\nRoy vs. Ronobroto Roy3, where the Court noticed from the facts that the husband alleged infidelity\r\nagainst his wife and questioned the fatherhood of the child born to his wife. In those circumstances,\r\nwhen the wife had denied the charge of infidelity, the Court opined that but for the DNA test, it\r\nwould be impossible for the husband to establish the assertion made in the pleadings. In these facts the decision of the High Court to order for DNA testing was approved by the Supreme Court. Even\r\nthen, Justice J.S. Khehar, writing for the Division Bench, considered it appropriate to record a\r\ncaveat to the effect that the wife may refuse to comply with the High Court direction for the DNA\r\ntest but in that case, presumption may be drawn against the party.\r\n11.1 In circumstances where other evidence is available to prove or dispute the relationship, the\r\ncourt should ordinarily refrain from ordering blood tests. This is 3(2015) 1 SCC 365 because such\r\ntests impinge upon the right of privacy of an individual and could also have major societal\r\nrepercussions. Indian law leans towards legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy. The presumption in\r\nlaw of legitimacy of a child cannot be lightly repelled. This Court, in Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram4,\r\nwhile determining the question of standard of proof required to displace the presumption in favor of\r\npaternity of child born during subsistence of valid marriage held:\r\n\u201C10. We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence Act was enacted at a time\r\nwhen the modern scientific advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well\r\nas ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in contemplation of the legislature. The\r\nresult of a genuine DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even that is not\r\nenough to escape from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Act e.g. if a husband\r\nand wife were living together during the time of conception but the DNA test revealed\r\nthat the child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain\r\nirrebuttable. This may look hard from the point of view of the husband who would be\r\ncompelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which he may be innocent. But even in\r\nsuch a case the law leans in favor of the innocent child from being bastardised if his\r\nmother and her spouse were living together during the time of conception. Hence the\r\nquestion regarding the degree of proof of non-access for rebutting the conclusiveness\r\nmust be 4 2001(5) SCC 311 answered in the light of what is meant by access or\r\nnon-access as delineated above.\u201D 11.2. The presumption of legitimacy of a child can\r\nonly be displaced by strong preponderance of evidence, and not merely by balance of\r\nprobabilities. The material portion of the Court\u2019s opinion is produced herein below:\r\n\u201C11 \u2026..But at the same time the test of preponderance of probability is too light as\r\nthat might expose many children to the peril of being illegitimatized. If a court\r\ndeclares that the husband is not the father of his wife's child, without tracing out its\r\nreal father the fallout on the child is ruinous apart from all the ignominy visiting his\r\nmother. The bastardised child, when grows up would be socially ostracised and can\r\neasily fall into wayward life. Hence, by way of abundant caution and as a matter of\r\npublic policy, law cannot afford to allow such consequence befalling an innocent child\r\non the strength of a mere tilting of probability. Its corollary is that the burden of the\r\nplaintiff husband should be higher than the standard of preponderance of\r\nprobabilities. The standard of proof in such cases must at least be of a degree in\r\nbetween the two as to ensure that there was no possibility of the child being\r\nconceived through the plaintiff husband.\u201D12. It was also the view of the Court that normal rule of evidence is that the burden is on the party\r\nthat asserts the positive. But in instances where that is challenged, the burden is shifted to the party,\r\nthat pleads the negative. Keeping in mind the issue of burden of proof, it would be safe to conclude\r\nthat in a case like the present, the Court\u2019s decision should be rendered only after balancing the\r\ninterests of the parties, i.e, the quest for truth, and the social and cultural implications involved\r\ntherein. The possibility of stigmatizing a person as a bastard, the ignominy that attaches to an adult\r\nwho, in the mature years of his life is shown to be not the biological son of his parents may not only\r\nbe a heavy cross to bear but would also intrude upon his right of privacy.\r\n13. DNA is unique to an individual (barring twins) and can be used to identify a person\u2019s identity,\r\ntrace familial linkages or even reveal sensitive health information. Whether a person can be\r\ncompelled to provide a sample for DNA in such matters can also be answered considering the test of\r\nproportionality laid down in the unanimous decision of this Court in K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of\r\nIndia5, wherein the right to privacy has been declared a constitutionally protected right in India.\r\nThe Court should therefore examine the proportionality of the legitimate aims being pursued, 52019\r\n(1) SCC 1 i.e whether the same are not arbitrary or discriminatory, whether they may have an\r\nadverse impact on the person and that they justify the encroachment upon the privacy and personal\r\nautonomy of the person, being subjected to the DNA Test. It cannot be overlooked that in the\r\npresent case, the application to subject the Plaintiff to a DNA Test is in a declaratory suit and the\r\nplaintiff has already adduced evidence and is not interested to produce additional evidence (DNA),\r\nto prove his case. It is now the turn of the defendants to adduce their evidence. At this stage, they\r\nare asking for subjecting the plaintiff to a DNA test. Questioning the timing of the application the\r\ntrial Court dismissed the defendants application and we feel that it was the correct order.\r\n14. In the yet to be decided suit, the plaintiff has led evidence through sworn affidavits of the\r\nRespondents, his School Leaving Certificates and his Domicile Certificate. Significantly, the\r\nrespondent No.1, who is one of the 3 siblings (defendants) had declared in her affidavit that the\r\nPlaintiff was raised as a son by her parents. Therefore, the nature of further evidence to be adduced\r\nby the plaintiff (by providing DNA sample), need not be ordered by the Court at the instance of the\r\nother side. In such kind of litigation where the interest will have to be balanced and the test of\r\neminent need is not satisfied our considered opinion is that the protection of the right to privacy of\r\nthe Plaintiff should get precedence.\r\n15. Having answered these questions, additional issue to be resolved is whether refusal to undergo\r\nDNA Testing amounts to \u2018other evidence\u2019 or in other words, can an adverse inference be drawn in\r\nsuch situation. In Sharda vs. Dharmpal6 a three judges bench in the opinion written by Justice S.B.\r\nSinha rightly observed in paragraph 79 that \u201Dif despite an order passed by the court, a person refuses\r\nto submit himself to such medical examination, a strong case for drawing an adverse inference\u201D can\r\nbe made out against the person within the ambit of Section 114 of the Evidence Act. The plaintiff\r\nhere has adduced his documentary evidence and is disinclined to produce further evidence. He is\r\nconscious of the adverse consequences of his refusal but is standing firm in refusing to undergo the\r\nDNA Test. His suit eventually will be decided on the nature and quality of 6 2003(4) SCC 493 the\r\nevidence adduced. The issue of drawing adverse inference may also arise based on the refusal. The\r\nCourt is to weigh both side\u2019s evidence with all attendant circumstances and then reach a verdict in\r\nthe Suit and this is not the kind of case where a DNA test of the plaintiff is without exception.\r\n16. The respondent cannot compel the plaintiff to adduce further evidence in support of the\r\ndefendants\u2019 case. In any case, it is the burden on a litigating party to prove his case adducing\r\nevidence in support of his plea and the court should not compel the party to prove his case in the\r\nmanner, suggested by the contesting party.\r\n17. The appellant (plaintiff) as noted earlier, has brought on record the evidence in his support\r\nwhich in his assessment adequately establishes his case. His suit will succeed or fall with those\r\nevidence, subject of course to the evidence adduced by the other side. When the plaintiff is unwilling\r\nto subject himself to the DNA test, forcing him to undergo one would impinge on his personal liberty\r\nand his right to privacy. Seen from this perspective, the impugned judgment merits interference and\r\nis set aside. In consequence thereof, the order passed by the learned Trial Court on 28.11.2017 is\r\nrestored. The suit is ordered to proceed accordingly.\r\n18. With the above order, the appeal stands allowed leaving the parties to bear their respective cost",

            "judgement":"1. Leave granted.\r\n2. Mohan Singh was killed on 06.11.2009 during the evening hours. F.I.R. No. 458 of 2009 was\r\nthereupon registered by his father, Devisingh, on the file of P.S. Kishanpura Ganj, District Indore.\r\nThe time of registration of the F.I.R. was mentioned therein as 08:30 pm on 06.11.2009 while the\r\ntime of occurrence of the offence was shown as 06:30 pm on that day. Five men, viz., Arun,\r\nRadheshyam, Narendra, Abhay Singh and Ramlal (the last was the only one named as an accused in\r\nthe F.I.R.) stood trial for the murder of Mohan Singh and other offences. By judgment dated\r\n27.06.2013 in Sessions Trial No. 213 of 2010, the learned II Additional Sessions Judge, Mhow,\r\nDistrict Indore, held them guilty on all counts. They were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for\r\nlife for the murder of Mohan Singh under Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 IPC. They were\r\nvisited with lesser sentences for the other offences along with fines, coupled with default\r\nimprisonment.3. Assailing the judgment of the Trial Court, all five of them jointly filed Criminal Appeal No.932 of\r\n2013 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore. By judgment dated 25.01.2024, a Division\r\nBench of the High Court allowed the said appeal insofar as it pertained to Abhay Singh and\r\nacquitted him of all charges but dismissed the appeal apropos the remaining four appellants and\r\nconfirmed their convictions and sentences. Aggrieved thereby, Arun, Radheshyam, Narendra and\r\nRamlal are before us by way of these appeals by special leave.\r\n4. The prosecution\u2019s case was that, at about 05.00 pm on that fateful day, Vijay Dongre came to visit\r\nhis friend, Mohan Singh, at his village, Bhatkhadi. After some time, Vijay Dongre requested Mohan\r\nSingh to drop him at Chowpatty on his motorcycle. Abhay, son of Gopal, the brother of Mohan\r\nSingh, also accompanied them to get a haircut. All three of them accordingly proceeded on the\r\nmotorcycle to Chowpatty. After dropping Vijay Dongre there and after Abhay got his haircut at a\r\nsaloon near Chowpatty, Mohan Singh and Abhay started back on the motorcycle. The fatal attack on\r\nMohan Singh is stated to have taken place at that time.\r\n5. The homicidal death of Mohan Singh stands confirmed by the post-mortem report (Ex. P-3) and\r\nthe evidence of Dr. L.S. Verma (PW-2), who was one of the doctors who conducted the post-mortem.\r\nHe confirmed that Mohan Singh had sustained 5 wounds and that the cause of his death was shock\r\nand internal and external hemorrhage due to a gunshot wound and other injuries to vital organs.\r\nDuring his cross- examination, however, Dr. L.S. Verma (PW-2) conceded to the effect that Wound\r\nNo.1 was not a gunshot wound but was caused by a stabbing weapon.\r\n6. Devisingh, father of Mohan Singh, had lodged the F.I.R. shortly after his death. Therein, he stated\r\nthat, at around 06.30pm, Abhay said to him that 3-4 persons were beating his \u2018elder father\u2019, Mohan\r\nSingh, and that blood was oozing out from his abdomen. Devisingh said that he went running there\r\nand, in the meanwhile, his daughter-in-law also reached there. He found the vehicle of Mohan Singh\r\nparked along the road and he saw two persons absconding - one was Ramlal, son of Devaji, and the\r\nother was dressed in a suit and was wearing shoes. They were running towards Manpur. Devisingh\r\nsaid that Mohan Singh was shot and his head was crushed with stones and he had been murdered by\r\nfiring a bullet into his abdomen. This was the initial information given by Devisingh.\r\n7. As many as twenty-five witnesses were examined by the prosecution to prove its case. However,\r\nthe oral evidence that was adduced before the Trial Court by Devisingh and his family members was,\r\nin our opinion, clearly embellished and augmented so as to implicate and indict the five men who\r\nstood accused of the murder of Mohan Singh.\r\n8. Devisingh deposed as PW-1. He stated that after Mohan Singh left to Chowpatty with his nephew,\r\nAbhay, and Vijay Dongre, the five accused passed by their field at about 05.30 pm, heading towards\r\nChowpatty. He, along with Madhubala, his daughter-in-law, and his son, Mehar Singh, saw them.\r\nHe stated that Madhubala entertained a doubt as these persons had enmity with them due to a land\r\ndispute and she, along with his other son, Gopal, went towards Chowpatty. He claimed that he also\r\nwent behind them. He further stated that about 10 feet away from the place of the incident, Abhay\r\nmet them and told them that 4-5 persons were beating his \u2018elder father\u2019 and his abdomen was\r\nbleeding. They also reached the place of the incident and saw that there were people beating thedeceased. Upon seeing him, Ramlal and Abhay Singh ran away towards Chowpatty while Arun and\r\nothers ran towards their fields nearby. Devisingh claimed that he saw them hitting with stones. He\r\nsaid that his son was lying dead in a 10 feet deep pit and his head was crushed by stones.\r\n9. In his cross-examination, Devisingh said that it would take 5 to 7 minutes from his field to reach\r\nthe spot where his son\u2019s body was found. He stated that his son had left for Chowpatty between\r\n05.00 \u2013 05.30 pm. He said that Madhubala, Gopal and Mehar Singh did not leave 2-3 minutes after\r\nMohan Singh left and added that he himself left at 06.00 pm for Chowpatty and Gopal, Mehar Singh\r\nand Madhubala were with him. They reached the place of the incident within 5-7 minutes.\r\nDevisingh\u2019s version before the Trial Court was, therefore, entirely different from what he had\r\noriginally stated and was recorded in the F.I.R.\r\n10. Madhubala, the wife of Mohan Singh, deposed as PW-4. She said that the incident took place at\r\n06.00 - 06.30 pm on 06.11.2009. According to her, Mohan Singh, along with Vijay Dongre and\r\nAbhay, left for Chowpatty at 05.30 pm on a motorcycle. She claimed that after their departure, all\r\nthe accused went towards Chowpatty and she felt suspicious about them, as they had enmity with\r\nher husband. She told her father-in-law, Devisingh, and brother-in-law, Gopal, and they all started\r\ntowards Chowpatty. When they were nearing Chowpatty, Abhay, who was standing on the road,\r\ncame running and told her that his uncle was being beaten by some people of the village. She ran\r\nand crossed the road. At that time, she heard the sound of a gunshot. When she reached near,\r\nRamlal of their village was throwing stones at her husband\u2019s back while Arun had a pistol in his\r\nhand and he was also throwing stones. Radheshyam was picking up stones and hitting her husband\r\non his back and Narendra Singh was also doing so. When her brother-in-law and father-in-law came\r\nnear, the accused ran away.\r\n11. Mehar Singh, brother of Mohan Singh, deposed as PW-6. He spoke on the same lines as his\r\nsister-in-law, Madhubala. Significantly, Devisingh did not say he heard a gunshot but Madhubala\r\nand Mehar Singh said so. Gopal, the other brother and father of Abhay, the child witness, deposed\r\nas PW-8. He also did not hear a gunshot but stated that he saw the accused, Arun, holding a revolver\r\nin his hand. He further stated that he saw the other four accused throwing stones at Mohan Singh\r\nand that the accused ran away when they shouted.\r\n12. Abhay (PW-11) was a crucial witness as he was the one who is stated to have accompanied\r\nMohan Singh and would have been with him at the time of the attack. He was about 07 years of age\r\nwhen he deposed before the Trial Court on 24.02.2011. He would have, therefore, been about 06\r\nyears old on 06.11.2009. He also gave graphic details of the accused attacking Mohan Singh.\r\nAccording to him, the accused hit their motorcycle but even after the collusion they were still sitting\r\non it. Arun, one of the accused, then shot his uncle in the stomach while the other four accused\r\nthrew stones on his face. He started running from there and found his mother nearby. He also\r\nclaimed that he informed the police about these details.\r\n13. In his cross-examination, Abhay unwittingly spoke of the events at Chowpatty. He stated that\r\nMohan Singh took him along with his friend to a friend\u2019s hotel at Chowpatty where they had tea.\r\nAccording to him, they stayed there for half an hour and it was only thereafter, they started to the\r\nHousing from Chowpatty to get him a haircut. He said that it took about half an hour to get his\r\nhaircut. Abhay further stated that the police had interrogated him only once and his statement was\r\nrecorded.\r\n14. Notably, D.S. Parmar, the Investigating Officer, who deposed as PW-20, admitted that Abhay\u2019s\r\nstatement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded only on 23.11.2009, that is, 17 days after the\r\nincident. Similarly, the statement of Madhubala (PW-4) was also recorded after 17 days and the\r\nstatement of Gopal (PW-8) was recorded after 7 days. This delay on the part of the Investigating\r\nOfficer in recording the statements of these so-called crucial witnesses is unfathomable, given their\r\navailability and the versions given by them. It casts a cloud on the very veracity of their testimonies.\r\nFurther, the discrepancies in the timelines brought out by them demonstrates in no uncertain terms\r\nthat the narratives of these witnesses are not free from suspicion and doubt.\r\n15. According to Devisingh, they left at 06.00 pm and it only took about 5 to 7 minutes from their\r\nfield to reach the spot where the deceased was found. According to all these witnesses, Mohan\r\nSingh, along with Vijay Dongre and Abhay, left for Chowpatty at 05.30 pm. Abhay, the child witness,\r\nsaid that they spent half an hour having tea and another half an hour at the barber\u2019s shop.\r\nTherefore, they could not have started back to the village before 06.30pm. However, the incident is\r\nstated to have occurred at that time or even earlier, going by their timelines. To compound matters\r\nfurther, Vijay Dongre, the friend of Mohan Singh, who deposed as PW-5, stated that he had gone to\r\nmeet Mohan Singh at 05:30-05:45 pm in the evening on 06.11.2009 and stayed with him at his farm\r\nfor about 15-20 minutes. He stated that he, along with Mohan Singh and Abhay, left the farm\r\nthereafter to go to Chowpatty. According to him, the distance from the farm to Chowpatty is about 2\r\n\u00BD kms but it would be 3 kms by the road leading to the Housing Square. He stated that, after\r\nleaving him at Chowpatty, Mohan Singh told him that he would go to the Housing Square for\r\nAbhay\u2019s haircut. He said that when Mohan Singh left him at Chowpatty, it was about 06:15- 06:30\r\npm. Juxtaposing the versions of Vijay Dongre (PW-5) and Abhay (PW-11), it is clear that Mohan\r\nSingh and Abhay could not have been at the spot where the attack took place by 06:30 pm. Abhay\r\nhad stated that the haircut took half an hour and, at the very least, it would have been 06:45 pm by\r\nthe time the haircut was completed. The timelines, therefore, do not match.\r\n16. As the maxim \u2018Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\u2019 (false in one thing, false in everything) is not\r\npart of Indian law and jurisprudence and is, at best, a rule of caution, the entire evidence of these\r\nwitnesses need not be discarded because some of their statements are proved to be factually\r\nincorrect. However, their depositions would have to be viewed with care and caution before they are\r\naccepted and acted upon. In this regard, we may note that the enmity between the family of the\r\ndeceased and some of the accused was admitted by the family members themselves. Their\r\ndepositions before the Trial Court, naming all the accused and attributing specific overt acts to each\r\nof them, would have to be examined very carefully, given the variance in the initial version in the\r\nF.I.R. In fact, this inconsistency dented the prosecution\u2019s case in entirety even against Ramlal.\r\n17. All that Devisingh had reported at the time of registration of the F.I.R. was that he saw Ramlal,\r\none of the five accused, and a man wearing a suit and shoes, who remained unknown, running away\r\nfrom the spot. He did not name any of the other accused but his deposition before the Trial Court\r\nwas very much to the contrary, as he not only named them but also attributed specific overt acts to\r\nthem. Similarly, the other family members, whose very presence at the spot becomes rather\r\ndoubtful, furnished full-fledged details of how the accused attacked Mohan Singh. In this regard, the\r\nevidence of D.S. Parmar, the Investigating Officer (PW-20), assumes great significance. He\r\ncategorically asserted that none of these witnesses had stated the versions that they put forth before\r\nthe Trial Court in their Section 161 Cr.P.C. statements. He affirmed that Devisingh, in his statement\r\n(Ex. D1), had stated as was recorded in the F.I.R. and did not mention anything about\r\nMadhubala, his daughter-in-law, becoming suspicious and about he, along with his\r\nother family members, going towards Chowpatty.\r\n18. The only other incriminating circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was the recovery of a\r\n12-bore country made pistol from Arun, one of the appellants. However, surprisingly, no bullet was\r\nrecovered from the body of Mohan Singh, the deceased, though there is no evidence of any exit\r\nwound. Further, Dr. L.S. Verma (PW-2) candidly admitted to the effect that what was initially stated\r\nby him to be a gunshot wound was actually caused by a stabbing weapon. In consequence, the cause\r\nof Mohan Singh\u2019s death being a \u2018gunshot wound\u2019 is itself open to question and, therefore, the\r\nso-called recovery of the pistol from Arun does not help the prosecution.\r\n19. As matters stand, the entire case of the prosecution hinges only upon the oral evidence of the\r\nfamily members of Mohan Singh, the deceased. However, as already noted hereinbefore, their\r\nevidence is found to be completely untrustworthy and specious. Conviction of the appellants cannot\r\nrest solely on such doubtful testimonies. The Trial Court and the High Court erred in the\r\nappreciation of this dubious oral evidence and in drawing the proper inferences therefrom. The\r\nappellants would invariably have to be given the benefit of doubt in such circumstances, as the\r\nprosecution failed to prove the charges levelled against them beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n20. On the above analysis, the appeals are allowed, setting aside the judgment dated 25.01.2024\r\npassed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore in Criminal Appeal No. 932 of 2013 as well\r\nas the judgment dated 27.06.2013 passed by the learned II Additional Sessions Judge, Mhow,\r\nDistrict Indore, in Sessions Trial No. 213 of 2010. All the appellants shall stand acquitted of the\r\ncharged offences.\r\nBy order dated 12.02.2025, we had suspended the sentences of Arun, Narendra and Radheshyam\r\nand directed their release on terms and conditions to be fixed by the Trial Court. Therefore, as on\r\ndate, only Ramlal remains in custody. Ramlal shall also be set at liberty forthwith, unless his\r\ncontinued incarceration is lawfully required in connection with any other case. Bail Bonds and\r\nsureties furnished by the other appellants shall stand discharged. Fine amounts paid by the\r\nappellants, if any, shall be refunded to them.",

          "judgement":"SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.\r\n1. The social objective of providing land to the tiller and the landless post independence was sought\r\nto be subserved by bringing in ceiling in agricultural holdings in different States. It is towards this\r\nobjective that the Madhya Pradesh Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred\r\nto as the \u2018said Act\u2019) was brought into force in 1960. The said Act, inter alia, provided for acquisition\r\nas well as disposal of surplus land.\r\n2. The predecessor-in-interest of the appellant (now represented by the LRs) was the bhumiswami\r\nof agricultural dry land measuring 64.438 acres situated in Village Bagadua, Paragna Sheopur Kala,\r\nDistrict Morena, Madhya Pradesh. He was, thus, stated to be holding land in excess of the ceiling\r\nlimit prescribed as per Section 7(b) of the said Act, whereby a holder along with his family of five\r\nmembers or less could hold a maximum amount of 54 acres of land. As a sequitur thereto the\r\ncompetent authority\/competent officer (respondent No.2 herein) initiated the process to acquire the\r\nsurplus land and issued a draft statement in Land Ceiling Case No.180\/75-76\/A-90(B) for\r\nacquisition of 10.436 acres of dry land from Survey Nos.755, 756, 780 and 881\/1 (for short \u2018surplus\r\nland\u2019). A final order dated 30.3.1979 was published declaring such land as surplus. In furtherance of\r\nthe aforesaid, the respondents herein initiated the process of taking over possession and eviction\r\nunder Section 248 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as the\r\n\u2018said Code\u2019) (the provision has since been deleted).\r\n3. The appellant being aggrieved by the final order dated 30.3.1979 filed a suit for declaration of title\r\nand permanent injunction before the Court of Civil Judge Class-II, Sheopur Kala, District Morena. It\r\nis the say of the appellant, as per averments in the plaint, that the proceedings to recover land from\r\nhim were illegal as he was actually left with only 54 acres of land which was within the prescribed\r\nceiling limit in view of the fact that the land measuring 17 bighas and 7 biswa in Survey No.77 had\r\nbeen decreed in favour of one Jenobai, who was in kabza kasht (possession by cultivation) of the\r\nland for about 20 years. She had filed a civil suit, being Civil Suit No.319\/75A O.C. on 15.10.1975\r\nagainst the appellant seeking declaration of title and permanent injunction with respect to the\r\naforementioned land. There had been an admission of the ground position by the appellant and\r\nthus, the suit was decreed on 5.3.1979 declaring Jenobai to be the owner in possession of the said\r\nland. We may note that Jenobai is actually the mother-in-law of the appellant and according to her,\r\nthis land was being cultivated by her on the basis of half and half of the land proceeds. However,\r\nsubsequently the appellant developed improper intent and taking advantage of her being a widow\r\nand an old woman, had colluded with the Patwari to get this disputed land mutated in his name.\r\n4. The suit filed by the appellant was contested by the respondents herein and they took a defence in\r\nthe written statement that the possession of the surplus land had been taken over and allotted to\r\nother cultivators. There was, however, an admission that the appellant in the return, filed as per\r\nSection 9 of the said Act, mentioned the aspect of the pending suit qua Survey No.77. However, it\r\nwas contended that the appellant had neither submitted a copy of the suit nor any proof of pendency\r\nof the suit. The suit was alleged to be collusive inasmuch as Jenobai, in fact, was the mother-in-law\r\nof the appellant and the endeavour was to prevent the surplus land from being acquired. It was\r\npleaded that Jenobai, if she had title or possession of the land in survey No.77, would have\r\nsubmitted a claim before the competent authority after the draft statement was issued. The\r\nappellant was also alleged to not have submitted any objection to the draft statement and the\r\nremedy of the appellant was stated to be by way of an appeal before the competent court which was\r\nnot pursued. The order of the competent authority was stated to have become final and, thus, the\r\naction for taking over possession of surplus land and allotment thereof was lawful.\r\n5. The trial court decided the suit post trial vide judgment and decree dated 7.10.1997. The trial\r\ncourt held that the appellant was the bhumiswami in respect of the survey number in question and\r\nthe suit was collusive with Jenobai having knowledge of the ceiling proceedings. These findings\r\nresulted in a dismissal of the suit.\r\n6. The appellant filed an appeal under Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as the \u2018CPC\u2019) before the Court of Additional District Judge, Sheopur Kala, District\r\nMorena. The appellant\u2019s say was that in view of the pendency of the suit filed by Jenobai, the\r\nproceedings under the said Act should have been kept in abeyance in view of the provisions of\r\nSection 11(4) of the said Act. The relevant provisions of Section 11 read as under:\r\n\u201C11. Preparation of statement of land held in excess of the ceiling area. - (1) On the\r\nbasis of information given in the return under Section 9 or the information obtained\r\nby the competent authority under Section 10, the said authority shall after making\r\nsuch enquiry as it may deem fit, prepare a separate draft statement in respect of each\r\nperson holding land in excess of the ceiling area, containing the following particulars:\r\n(3) The draft statement shall be published at such place and in such manner as may\r\nbe prescribed and a copy thereof shall be served on the holder or holders concerned,\r\nthe creditors and all other persons interested in the land to which it relates. Any\r\nobjection to the draft statement received within thirty days of the publication thereof\r\nshall be duly considered by the competent authority who after giving the objector an\r\nopportunity of being heard shall pass such order as it deems fit.\r\n(4) If while considering the objections received under sub-section (3) or otherwise,\r\nthe competent authority finds that any question has arisen regarding the title of a\r\nparticular holder and such question has not already been determined by a Court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction, the competent authority shall proceed to enquire summarily\r\ninto the merits of such question and pass such orders as it thinks fit.\r\nProvided that if such question is already pending for decision before a competent court, the\r\ncompetent authority shall await the decision of the court.\r\n(5) The order of the competent authority under sub-section (4) shall subject to appeal or revision,\r\nbut any party may, within three months from the date of such order, institute a suit in the civil court\r\nto have the order set aside, and the decision of such court shall be binding on the competent\r\nauthority, but subject to the result of such suit, if any, the order of the competent authority shall be\r\nfinal and conclusive.] [(6) After all such objections, have been disposed of, the competent authority\r\nshall, subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder, make necessary\r\nalterations in the draft statement in accordance with the orders passed on objections and shall\r\ndeclare the surplus land held by each holder. The competent authority shall, thereafter, publish a\r\nfinal statement specifying therein the entire land held by the holder, the land to be retained by him\r\nand the land declared to be surplus and send a copy thereof the holder concerned. Such a statement\r\nshall be published in such manner as may be prescribed and shall be conclusive evidence of the facts\r\nstated therein.]\u201D\r\n7. The information about the pendency of the suit between Jenobai and the appellant had been\r\nfurnished to the competent authority, and post decree of the suit the appellant had been left with\r\nonly 54 acres of land. Thus, there was no reason to initiate proceedings to take possession of the\r\ndisputed land. The appellate court noted the admission in the written statement filed by the\r\nrespondents herein, that in the return filed by the appellant there was disclosure of the factum of\r\nJenobai being in possession of Survey No.77 land as also of the pendency of the suit, being Suit\r\nNo.319A\/75 between her and the appellant. That being the factual position, Section 11(3) of the said\r\nAct mandated that the copy of the draft statement ought to have been served on Jenobai as she was\r\nan \u2018interested person\u2019 in the land. The acquisition proceedings had to be kept in abeyance in view of\r\nthe proviso to Section 11(4) of the said Act till the disposal of the suit, and that such a judgment of\r\nthe civil court was binding on the competent authority. The suit was stated to have been decreed for\r\n3.306 hectares out of 17.715 hectares of land recorded in the name of the appellant, resultantly\r\nleaving 14.399 hectares of land, which was within the prescribed limited under Section 7 of the said\r\nAct. On the basis of these findings, the appeal was allowed and the judgment of the trial court was\r\nset aside on the ground that the competent authority had failed to comply with the statutory\r\nprovisions under Section 11(3) and 11(4) of the said Act. The appellant was declared as the\r\nbhumiswami of the surplus land and the respondents were restrained from interfering with his\r\npossession of the land.\r\n8. It is now the turn of the respondents herein to prefer an appeal under Section 100 of the CPC\r\nbefore the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior Bench in Second Appeal No.644 of 1998. The\r\nHigh Court vide order dated 8.5.2008 framed two substantive questions of law, which read as\r\nunder:\r\n\u201Ci. Whether the jurisdiction of the Civil Court challenging the order of the Competent\r\nOfficer is barred under Section 46 of the said Act?\r\nii. Whether the judgment and decree of the first appellate court is sustainable under\r\nthe provisions of the said Act?\u201D\r\n9. On a conspectus of the matter, the High Court allowed the appeal. The rationale for the same was\r\nthat after the publication of the draft statement neither the appellant nor Jenobai had filed\r\nobjections. In the revenue records the appellant\u2019s name was recorded as holder of the entire\r\nagricultural land in question. No information was stated to have been provided to the competent\r\nauthority giving particulars of the suit of Jenobai. The competent authority was found not at fault in\r\nthe alleged breach of Sections 11(3) and 11(4) of the said Act as the information germane for the\r\nsame had not been disclosed.\r\n10. The appellant at that stage, thus, approached this Court by the present Special Leave Petition\r\nand on 2.3.2009, notice was issued and status quo was directed to be maintained. Subsequently,\r\nleave was granted on 26.7.2010 and ad interim order was made absolute till the disposal of the\r\nappeal.\r\n11. On the appeal being taken up for hearing on 16.1.2020 an order was passed recording the factual\r\ncontroversy as to whether the appellant had filed objections giving particulars of the pendency of the\r\ncivil suit. This was so as in terms of Section 9(iv) of the said Act that such particulars were required\r\nto be stated. Even on the question of maintainability of the suit, it was mentioned that it was\r\nnecessary to peruse the objections filed by the appellant to determine whether the requirement of\r\nSection 9 of the said Act had been fulfilled, Thus, records of the last ceiling case were directed to be\r\nproduced by the respondents herein. The records were, however, not produced and, thus, on\r\n9.9.2020, an order was passed giving further time but directing that failure to produce the record\r\nwould result in an adverse inference being drawn against the respondents herein.\r\n12. The respondents filed an affidavit on 26.9.2020 stating that the records were untraceable\r\nincluding the objections filed by the appellant. It appears that due to carving out of some districts\r\nthe records could not be traced out. The son of the appellant had stated that he did not have the\r\nrecord either.\r\n13. We have heard learned counsel for the parties, albeit in the absence of the aforesaid record,\r\nwhich was not produced right till the date of hearing.\r\n14. The appellant canvassed that the civil suit filed was maintainable as the bar of jurisdiction of the\r\ncivil court did not come into play as specified in Section 46 of the said Act in view of the provisions\r\nof Sections 11(4) and 11(5) of the said Act read together. Section 46 of the said Act reads as under:\r\n\u201C46. Bar of jurisdiction of Civil Courts. \u2013 Save as expressly provided in this Act, no\r\nCivil Court shall have any jurisdiction to settle, decide or deal with any question\r\nwhich is by or under this Act required to be settled, decided or dealt with by the\r\ncompetent authority.\u201D\r\n15. The plea, thus, was that the Section begins with a saving clause qua the bar of civil court \u2013 \u201CSave\r\nas expressly provided in this Act\u2026..\u201D The provisions of Section 46 were pleaded to be expressly\r\nsubject to the provisions of Section 11(5) of the said Act and the observations in Competent\r\nAuthority, Tarana District, Ujjain (M.P.) v. Vijay Gupta & Ors.1 were relied upon, opining that a suit\r\ncan be filed in a civil court within three months of passing of an order by the competent authority\r\nunder Section 11(4) of the said Act in view of the provisions of Section 11(5) of the said Act. There\r\nwas pleaded to be an admission about the disclosure of the appellant regarding the factum of the\r\nsuit filed by Jenobai in the returns and, thus, the respondents herein were required to wait for the\r\noutcome of the suit and should have also invited objections from Jenobai. The decree in the civil suit\r\nbetween the appellant and Jenobai was, thus, submitted to be binding on the competent authority. 1\r\n1991 Supp (2) SCC 631.\r\n16. On the other hand, the respondents herein reiterated that the suit filed by Jenobai was a\r\ncollusive one and the object of the institution was to circumvent the provisions of the said Act. In\r\nthis behalf, it was submitted that the suit under Section 11(5) of the said Act can only be instituted\r\nwithin three months from the date of Section 11(4) order, the date of which is not mentioned.\r\nHowever, even if the date of the subsequent order under Section 11(6) passed on 31.3.1979 is\r\nconsidered, the period of three months elapsed as the suit was filed on 31.8.1979\/3.9.1979 (there is\r\nsome discrepancy qua the dates as recorded in different proceedings). Further under Section 11(5) of\r\nthe said Act, a suit can only be filed for setting aside the order under Section 11(4) of the said Act but\r\nno such prayer was made.\r\n17. It was urged that after the order under Section 11(6) of the said Act is passed, the land vests with\r\nthe State under Section 12 of the said Act and, thus, a suit for declaration of title was not\r\nmaintainable. There was no challenge to the order under Section 11(6) of the said Act and, thus, the\r\nsuit was not maintainable. It was also urged that no suit lies against an order under Section 11(6) of\r\nthe said Act in view of the judgment of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. v. Dungaji\r\n(Dead) Represented by Legal Representatives & Anr. 2 Learned counsel for the respondents herein\r\npleaded that though the appellant raised the issue about the pendency of the suit with Jenobai in the\r\nreturn filed under Section 9 of the said Act, the documents were not produced and exhibited in this\r\nbehalf even before the trial court. The possession of Jenobai as reflected in the revenue records was\r\nnot proved by any evidence led in that behalf. And, in fact, no such objections were filed before the\r\ntrial court.\r\n18. On the aspect of this Court observing that an adverse inference will be drawn as per the orders\r\ndated 16.1.2020 and 9.9.2020, it was submitted that the copy of the objections were never placed\r\nbefore the trial court, the first appellate court and the High Court and, thus, the appellant failed to\r\ndischarge the burden of proving the case. There should, thus, be no occasion to draw the adverse\r\ninference against the respondents herein.\r\n19. We have given a thought to the matter in the conspectus of what 2 (2019) 7 SCC 465.\r\nhas been urged before us on the different dates and the proceedings that had been recorded. The\r\nmatter was taken up on 16.1.2020 and in view of the submissions advanced by the parties, the Court\r\nrequired perusal of the record. Thus, in the proceedings it was recorded that there was a factual\r\ncontroversy as to whether the appellant in pursuance of the draft statement in the objections filed\r\nhad given the particulars of the pending civil suit filed by the mother-in-law of the appellant\r\nclaiming part of the land held by the appellant. This was considered to be relevant as in terms of\r\nSection 9(iv) of the said Act such particulars are mandated to be given and, thus, the respondents\r\nherein being in breach or not of the other succeeding provisions of the Act would depend on this\r\nimportant aspect. We also took note of the fact that as per the respondents herein no particulars had\r\nbeen given and the suit was alleged to be collusive. In order to determine the question it was opined\r\nthat this Court found it necessary to peruse the objections filed by the appellant to come to a\r\nconclusion.\r\n20. On the said date itself, this Court also required the pleadings in the civil suit filed by the\r\nmother-in-law, Jenobai, to be placed on record as also the judgment.\r\n21. The appellant complied with the order dated 16.1.2020 by filing these additional documents but\r\nthe respondents herein did not do the needful. It is in these circumstances that on 9.9.2020 this\r\nCourt made it clear that in case the records are not filed adverse inference will be drawn. The natural\r\nsequitur to this is that the failure to place the aforementioned documents on record shows that there\r\nhad been proper disclosure about the suit in the return filed under Section 9 of the said Act. The\r\nfactum of disclosure of the suit could not really be doubted by the respondents herein in view of\r\ntheir own pleadings (admitted in the pleadings before the trial court, as perused by us). However,\r\nthe records are alleged not to have been located.\r\n22. The aforesaid factual matrix is, thus, to be examined in the context of the provisions of the said\r\nAct. The preparation of the statement of land held in excess of ceiling limit under Section 11 of the\r\nsaid Act has to be on the basis of information given in the return under Section 9 of the said Act, or\r\nthe information obtained by the competent authority under Section 10 of the said Act after making\r\nan enquiry. In terms of Section 11(3), the draft statement is to be published and served on the\r\nholder, the creditor and \u201Call other persons interested in the land to which it relates.\u201D Once a\r\ndisclosure is there that Jenobai had filed a suit, there has to be mandatorily a notice to her as\r\notherwise any decision would be behind her back and would, thus, violate the principles of natural\r\njustice.\r\n23. There is little ambiguity about the aforesaid position as in Section 11(4) it has been stated that in\r\ncase the competent authority finds that any question has arisen regarding the title of a particular\r\nholder, which has not been determined by the competent court, the competent authority shall\r\nproceed to enquire summarily into merits of such question and pass such orders as it thinks fit.\r\nThus, the power is vested with the competent authority to determine such conflict of the land\r\nholding. This is, however, subject to a proviso. The proviso clearly stipulates that if such a question\r\nis already pending for decision before the competent court, the competent authority shall await the\r\ndecision of the court.\r\n24. In our view, the embargo came there and then as once the disclosure was made the proceedings\r\nshould have been kept in abeyance to await the decision in those proceedings. The occasion to pass\r\norders under sub-section (5) and sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the said Act did not arise in the\r\npresent case as in view of the disclosure of Jenobai\u2019s suit. Further proceedings should have been\r\nkept in abeyance to await the verdict in the suit as per proviso to sub-section (4) and notice should\r\nhave been issued to Jenobai. All this has been observed to be in breach by the respondents herein.\r\nWe are, thus, of the view that the findings of the appellate court in constructions of these provisions\r\nreflects the correct position of law in the given facts of the case.\r\n25. The issue of jurisdiction of civil court is no more res integra in view of the judgment in\r\nCompetent Authority, Tarana District, Ujjain (M.P.).3 where it has been observed in para 4 as\r\nunder:\r\n\u201C4. So far as the other question regarding the maintainability of the suit in a civil\r\ncourt is concerned, suffice to say that sub-section (5) of Section 11 of the Act itself\r\nprovides that any party may within three months from the date of any order passed\r\nby the Competent Authority under sub-section (4) of Section 11 of the Act institute a\r\nsuit in the civil court to have the order set aside. Thus the above provision itself\r\npermits the filing of a suit in a civil court and any decision of such court has been\r\nmade binding on the Competent Authority under the above provision of sub-section\r\n(5) of Section 11 of the Act. It is not in dispute that the suit in the present case was\r\nfiled within three months as provided under sub-section (5) of 3 (supra).\r\nSection 11 of the Act. In the result, we do not find any force in this appeal and it is accordingly\r\ndismissed with no order as to costs.\u201D\r\n26. We have taken note of the latter proceedings of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. v.\r\nDungaji (Dead) Represented by Legal Representatives & Anr.4 discussing the scheme of the Act and\r\nthe requirement of taking recourse to the provisions of appeal and revision under the said Act.\r\n27. We have also considered the plea of limitation advanced by learned counsel for the respondents\r\nalbeit no specific issue being framed in respect of the same.\r\n28. In our view the legal position has to be appreciated in the factual context. Thus, though there\r\nmay be a process provided for redressal under the scheme of the Act, it is this very scheme of the Act\r\nwhich has been breached by the respondents herein in not complying with the statutory provisions.\r\nIt can be nobody\u2019s say that Jenobai cannot file a title suit against the appellant. That suit being\r\nmaintainable and pending, and the factum of that suit being disclosed in the return (if the nature of\r\n4 (supra).\r\ndisclosure being the reason we wanted to peruse the record, which were not made available), the\r\nprovisions of Section 11 had to be strictly complied with. We say so as the right to property is still a\r\nconstitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution of India though not a fundamental right.\r\nThe deprivation of the right can only be in accordance with the procedure established by law. The\r\nlaw in this case is the said Act. Thus, the provisions of the said Act had to be complied with to\r\ndeprive a person of the land being surplus.\r\n29. The provisions of the said Act are very clear as to what has to be done at each stage. In our view\r\nonce a disclosure was made, the matter had to be dealt with under sub-section (4) of Section 11 of\r\nthe said Act and in view of the pending suit proceedings between the appellant and Jenobai, the\r\nproviso came into play which required the respondent authorities to await the decision of the court.\r\nSub-section 5 and thereafter sub-section 6 would kick in only after the mandate of sub- section 4\r\nwas fulfilled. In the present case it was not so. Even notice was not issued to Jenobai. She could have\r\nclarified the position further. The effect of the decree in favour of Jenobai is that the appellant loses\r\nthe right to hold that land and his total land holding comes within the ceiling limit. If there is no\r\nsurplus land there can be no question of any proceedings for take over of the surplus land under the\r\nsaid Act.\r\n30. We are, thus, of the view that the impugned order is liable to be set aside and the order of the\r\nfirst appellate court is restored.\r\n31. The appeal is accordingly allowed leaving the parties to bear their own costs.\r\n...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

          "judgement":"L. NAGESWARA RAO, J.\r\n1. These appeals arise out of a judgment of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity at Delhi by which\r\nthe order passed by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) was reversed.\r\n2. The facts that are necessary for adjudication of the dispute in these appeals are as follows:\r\n1 | Page\r\n(a) Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited (KREDL) issued a Request\r\nfor proposal on 20.11.2015 from bidders for undertaking development of Solar PV\r\nground mount Power Plants in Karnataka pursuant to a decision taken by the State\r\nGovernment for development of 1200 MWA of Solar power to be implemented in 60\r\nTaluks through private sector participation. Emmvee Photovoltaic Power Private\r\nLimited, the second Respondent herein, incorporated two Special Purpose Vehicles\r\n(SPV) in accordance with the terms of the Request for Proposal and submitted its bid\r\nfor acceptance by the first Appellant, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited.\r\n(b) Respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal 9273 of 2019 is a special purpose vehicle constituted by\r\nRespondent No. 2 for setting up a Solar PV ground mount Project with a capacity of 10 MWA (AC)\r\nin Bidar Rural Taluk, Bidar District, Respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal 9274 of 2019 is a special\r\npurpose vehicle for setting up a 20 MWA (AC) capacity Solar PV ground mount Project in Bagepalli\r\nTaluk, Chikkaballapura.\r\n(c) The Projects were awarded to the Respondents on 31.03.2016. Power Purchase Agreements\r\n(PPAs) 2 | Page were entered into between the parties on 23.05.2016. The Power Purchase\r\nAgreements were approved by Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) on 17.10.2016.\r\nSupplementary Power Purchase Agreements were entered into between the parties on 17.12.2016\r\nincorporating the modifications suggested by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission on\r\n07.12.2016.\r\n(d) In respect of the Bidar Project, a Commissioning Certificate was issued on 25.10.2017 by KPTCL\r\non the basis of minutes of meeting that was held on 16.10.2017. The Commissioning Certificate for\r\nBagpalli Project was also issued on 23.11.2017.\r\n3. Original Petition (OP) No. 18 of 2018 was filed by the Respondents in Civil Appeal 9274 of 2019\r\naggrieved by the reduction of the tariff payable by Appellant No. 1 from Rs. 6.10\/kWh to Rs.\r\n4.36\/kWh and imposition of damages of Rs. 20,00,000\/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs only) for delay in\r\ncommissioning the plant.\r\n4. Apart from others, the main ground taken in the Original Petition by the Respondents is that\r\nCommissioning of the Project took place on 16.10.2017 which is clear from the Minutes of meeting\r\ndrawn by the Officials of KPTCL. The 3 | Page meeting was attended by officers of KPTCL, officers of\r\nGSCOM and representatives of the Respondents. It was contended by the Respondents that the\r\nProject commenced its operations within 12 months from the date of approval of the PPA by the\r\nKarnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission and the imposition of damages and reduction of tariff\r\npayable by the Appellant was contrary to the provisions of the agreement.\r\n5. Original Petition No. 19 of 2018 was filed by the Respondents in Civil Appeal 9273 of 2019 in\r\nrespect of the Solar PV ground mount Power Project in Bidar for reliefs similar to those claimed in\r\nOP 18 of 2018.\r\n6. The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission by its Order dated 23.10.2018 dismissed OP\r\nNo. 18 of 2018 and OP No. 19 of 2018. The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission framed\r\nfour issues for consideration which are as follows:\r\n(i) \u2018Whether the Scheduled Commissioning date\u2019 of the Solar Power Projects in\r\nquestion would fall in 16.10.2017 or 17.10.2017.\r\n(ii) On what date the Solar Power Projects in OP No. 18 of 2018 and OP 19 of 2018 have started\r\ninjection of power into the Grid.\r\n4 | Page\r\n(iii) Whether injection of power into the State Grid from a Solar Power Project is essential in order\r\nto declare that a Project is commissioned.\r\n(iv) \u2018Whether Commissioning of the Project\u2019 and \u2018Commercial Operation of the Project\u2019 are one and\r\nthe same or different concepts in a Solar Power Project.\r\n7. Insofar as issue No. 1 is concerned the Commission was of the view that the Scheduled\r\nCommissioning date for the Solar Power Projects of the Developer is 16.10.2017 and not 17.10.2017\r\nas contended by the Respondents. Considering issues 2, 3, and 4 together, the Commission was of\r\nthe opinion that the injection of power into the Grid from a Solar Power Project is a sine qua non for\r\ndeclaring that the Project is commissioned. The Commission was of the view that the injection of\r\npower from the Solar Power Project into the Grid was only on 17.10.2017. In view of the above\r\nfindings recorded by the Commission, the OP\u2019s were dismissed.\r\n8. The Respondents approached the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity by filing Appeal Nos.332 and\r\n333 of 2018. The Appellate Tribunal framed the following point for consideration:\r\n\u201CWhether the Project of the Appellants was delayed by one day in terms of Power\r\nPurchase Agreement and whether the Commission was justified in imposing 5 | Page\r\nliquidated damages on the Appellant for such delay in commissioning the Project.\u201D\r\n9. The Appellate Tribunal held that the Commissioning Date of both the Solar Plants according to\r\nKPTCL is 16.10.2017. According to the Tribunal, synchronization took place prior to the\r\ncommissioning of the Plant. The Tribunal was also of the view that the Scheduled date of\r\nCommissioning was done within the time limit prescribed under the agreements even if the\r\ncommencement of the Solar Plants is taken as 17.10.2017. The Appellate Tribunal for electricity\r\nallowed the Appeals filed by the Respondents and set aside the orders passed by the Karnataka\r\nElectricity Regulatory Commission. The Appellant has challenged the said judgment of the Appellate\r\nTribunal for Electricity in these Appeals.\r\n10. We have heard Mr. Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General and Mr. Balaji Srinivasan for the\r\nAppellant and Mr. Basava Prabhu Patil, learned Senior Advocate for the Respondents. The learned\r\nSolicitor General was critical of the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal for its interference with a\r\nwell-considered order of the Commission. He argued that the conclusion of the Appellate Tribunal\r\nthat the SCOD is 17.10.2017 and not 16.10.2017 is contrary to the terms of the PPA. He relied upon\r\nseveral clauses of the PPA to justify 6 | Page that the decision taken by the Appellant to impose\r\nliquidated damages and to reduce tariff to 4.36\/kWh from 6.10\/kWh. He emphasized that injection\r\nof power to the Grid is a pre requisite for determining the date of commissioning of a Solar Plant. He\r\nurged that the Tribunal committed an error in relying upon judgments relating to the General\r\nClauses Act when PPA excluded the applicability of the General Clauses Act.\r\n11. Mr. Balaji Srinivasan, took us through the documents to argue that regulatory commission\r\ncorrectly interpreted the agreement to include the first date and last date i.e. the date on which PPA\r\nwas approved by the KERC for determining the Scheduled Commissioning Date. He took us through\r\nthe material on record to show that there was minimum generation of power on 16.10.2017 which\r\nwas utilized for auxiliary purposes which does not satisfy the condition of injection of power into the\r\nGrid. He submitted that it is clear that there was no injection of power into the Grid till 17.10.2017\r\nand the Respondents are not entitled to tariff at the rate of 6.10\/kWh. Reliance was placed on a\r\njudgment of this Court reported in 2019 SCC online Supreme Court 1014 to argue that a Solar Power\r\nPlant is deemed to be commissioned only when there is injection of power into the Grid.\r\n7 | Page\r\n12. Mr. Basava Prabhu S. Patil, learned Senior Advocate responding to the submissions made on\r\nbehalf of the Appellant contended that the twelve months period for deciding the Scheduled\r\nCommissioning Date starts from 17.10.2016 which was the date of approval of PPA by KERC. He\r\nreferred to several covenants of the PPA to asseverate that the date of the event i.e. the date of\r\napproval of PPA has to be excluded for the purpose of computation of twelve months for deciding\r\nthe Scheduled Commissioning Date (SCOD). There is no dispute regarding injection of power to the\r\nGrid on 17.10.2017. Therefore, there is no default on the part of the Respondents and they were\r\nunnecessarily penalized. The alternative submission of the Respondents is that even if 17.10.2016 is\r\nnot excluded, twelve months end on 16.10.2017 on which day the Plants were commissioned.\r\nComputation of twelve months from 16.10.2017, in that case, cannot be detrimental to the\r\nRespondents. He emphasized that commissioning of the Plant is different from Commercial\r\nOperation date. He requested this Court not to interfere with the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal\r\nas the Respondents have entered into an agreement on the basis of the offer made by the Appellant\r\nto pay tariff at Rs. 6.10\/kWh. Any 8 | Page reduction of tariff would sound a death knell to the Solar\r\nPlants which are going through difficult times.\r\n13. Before we proceed further, it is necessary to have an overview of the PPA entered into between\r\nthe parties on 23.05.2016. Development of 1200 MWA of Solar Power in 60 Districts through\r\nprivate sector participation was a decision taken by the State Government for improving the power\r\ninfrastructure in the State. Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd. was appointed as a\r\nNodal agency for facilitating the development of renewable energy in the State. The offer made by\r\nthe Respondents for setting up two Solar PV ground mount Projects was accepted pursuant to which\r\nan agreement was entered into. The relevant provisions of the PPA which are relevant are as under:\r\nArticle 1.1 The words and expressions beginning with capital letters and defined in\r\nthis Agreement (including those in Article 21) shall, unless the context otherwise\r\nrequires, have the, meaning ascribed thereto herein, and the words and expressions\r\ndefined in the Schedules and used therein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in\r\nthe Schedules Article 1.2 (k) any reference to month shall mean a reference to a\r\ncalendar month as per the Gregorian calendar;\r\nArticle1.2 (l) and (m) any reference to any period commencing \"from\" a specified day\r\nor date and \"till\" or \"until\" a specified day or date shall include both such days or\r\ndates; provided 9 | Page that if the last day of any period computed under this\r\nAgreement is not a business day, then \u00B7the period shall run until the end of the next\r\nbusiness day;\r\nArticle 1.2.4 Any word or expression used in this Agreement shall, unless otherwise defined or\r\nconstrued in this Agreement, bear its ordinary English meaning and, for these purposes, the General\r\nClauses Act 1897 shall not apply.\r\nArticle 3 3.1. Effective Date This Agreement shall come into effect from the date of getting\r\nconcurrence from KERC on the PPA and such date shall be referred to as the Effective Date. Article\r\n5.1 Obligations of the Developer 5.1.1 Subject to and on the terms and conditions of this Agreement,\r\nthe Developer shall at its own coast and expense:\r\n(c) commence supply of power up to the Contracted Capacity to BESCOM no later\r\nthan the Scheduled Commissioning Date and continue the supply of power\r\nthroughout the term of the Agreement;\r\n5.4 Connectivity to the grid The Developer shall \u00B7 be responsible for power evacuation from the\r\nPower Project to the nearest Delivery Point\/ Delivery points.\r\nArticle 5.8 \u2013 Liquidated Damages for delay in commencement of supply of power to BESCOM 5.8.1.\r\nIf the Developer is unable to commence supply of power to BESCOM .by the Scheduled\r\nCommissioning Date other than for the reasons specified in Clause 5.7.1, the Developer shall pay to\r\nBESCOM, \u00B7 Liquidated Damages for the delay in such commencement of Supply of power and\r\nmaking the Contracted Capacity available for dispatch by the Scheduled Commissioning Date as per\r\nthe following:\r\n10 | P a g e a. For the delay up to one month an amount equivalent to 20\u00B0\/o of the\r\nPerformance Security.\r\nb.

In case the Developer delays\r\nthe achievement of Commercial Operation Date beyond 3 (three) months, the Developer shall pay to\r\nBESCOM, the Liquidated Damages at rate of INR 50,000\/-\r\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) per MW per day of delay for the delay in such commissioning.\r\nProvided that the Developer shall be required to make such payments to BESCOM in advance on a\r\nweek to week basis for the period of delay.\r\n5.8.3. The maximum time period allowed for achievement of Commercial Operation Date with\r\npayment of Liquidated Damages shall be limited to 22 (twenty two) months from the Effective Date.\r\nIn case, the achievement of COD is delayed beyond 22 (twenty two) months from the Effective Date,\r\nit. shall be considered as an Developer's Event of Default and provisions of Article 16 shall apply and\r\nthe Power Project shal.1 be removed from the list of selected projects in the event of termination of\r\nthis Agreement:\r\nARTICLE 8: Synchronization, Commissioning and Commercial Operation 8.1. The\r\nDeveloper shall provide at least forty (40) days advanced preliminary written notice\r\nand at least twenty (20) days advanced final written notice to BESCOM of the date on\r\nwhich it intends to synchronize the Power Project to the Grid System.\r\n11 | P a g e 8.2. Subject to Clause 8.1, the Power Project shall be synchronized by the Developer with\r\nthe Grid System when it meets all the connection conditions prescribed in applicable Grid Code then\r\nin effect and otherwise meets all other Indian legal requirements for synchronization to the Grid\r\nSystem.\r\n8.3. The synchronization equipment shall be installed by the Developer at its generation facility of\r\nthe Power Project at its own cost The Developer shall synchronize its system with the Grid System\r\nonly after the approval of synchronization scheme is granted by the head of the concerned\r\nsub-station\/Grid System and checking\/verification is made by the concerned authorities of the grid\r\nsystem.\r\n8.4. The Developer shall immediately after each synchronization\/tripping of generator, inform the\r\nsub- station of the Grid System to which the Power Project is electrically connected in accordance\r\nwith applicable Grid Code.\r\n8.5. The Developer shall commission the Project within 12 months from the Effective Date.\r\nARTICLE 12: APPLICABLE TARIFF AND SHARING OF COM BENEFITS 12.1. The Developer shall\r\nbe entitled to receive the Tariff of INR6.10 \/ kWh of energy supplied by it to BESCOM in accordance\r\nwith the terms of this Agreement during the period between COD and the Expiry Date.\r\n12.2. Provided further that as a consequence of delay in Commissioning of the Project beyond the\r\nScheduled Commissioning Date, subject to Article 4, if there is change in KERC applicable tariff, the\r\nchanged applicable Tariff for the Project shall be the lower of the following:\r\nI. Tariff at in Clause 12.1 above\r\nII. KERC applicable Tariff as on the Commercial\r\nOperation Date.\r\nARTICLE 21: DEFINITIONS\r\n\"COD\" or \"Commercial Operation Date\" shall mean the actual commissioning date of respective\r\nunits of the Power Project where upon the Developer starts injecting power from the Power Project\r\nto the Delivery Point.\r\n12 | P a g e \"Effective Date\" shall mean date of Approval of PPA KERC;\r\nMonth\" shall mean a period of thirty, (30) days from (and excluding) the date of the event, where\r\napplicable, else a calendar month.\r\nScheduled Commissioning Date\" shall mean 12 (twelve) months from the Effective Date.\r\n14. The dispute in these Appeals is whether the Respondents did not commission the Solar Projects\r\nbefore the expiry of 12 months from 17.10.2016 which is the date of approval of PPA by KERC. The\r\nconflicting views of the parties relate to the computation of 12 months for the purpose of\r\ndetermining whether the Scheduled Commissioning Date is 16.10.2017 or 17.10.2017. According to\r\nthe Appellants, SCOD is 17.10.2017 and on the other hand the Respondents contend that it is\r\n16.10.2017. The other issue that falls for consideration is whether injection of power is a\r\npre-requisite for deciding the Date of Commissioning of the Projects and whether the \u2018Commercial\r\nOperation Date\u2019 and \u2018Commissioning Date\u2019 are one and the same.\r\n15. Before embarking on the exercise of interpretation of the agreement it is necessary to take stock\r\nof the well- settled canons of construction of contracts. Lord Hoffmann in Investors Compensation\r\nScheme Limited vs. West 13 | P a g e Bromwich Building Society1 summarized the broad principles\r\nof interpretation of contract as follows:\r\n(1) Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would\r\nconvey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would\r\nreasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at\r\nthe time of the contract.\r\n(2) The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the \"matrix of\r\nfact,\" but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the\r\nbackground may include. Subject to the requirement that it should have been\r\nreasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next, it\r\nincludes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the\r\nlanguage of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.\r\n(3) The law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the\r\nparties and their declarations of subjective intent. They are admissible only in an\r\naction for rectification. The law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy\r\nand, in this respect only, legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret\r\nutterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects\r\nunclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them.\r\n(4) The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a\r\nreasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of\r\nwords is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what\r\nthe parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have\r\nbeen understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable\r\nman to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but\r\neven (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for\r\nwhatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax.\r\n(See : Mannai Investments Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] 2 WLR 945.\r\n(5) The \"rule\" that words should be given their \"natural and ordinary meaning\" reflects the common\r\nsense proposition 1 1998 (1) AIR 98 14 | P a g e that we do not easily accept that people have made\r\nlinguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other hand, if one would nevertheless\r\nconclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law\r\ndoes not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have\r\nhad. Lord Diplock made this point more vigorously when he said in The Antaios Compania Neviera\r\nSA v Salen Rederierna AB [1985] 1 AC 191, 201:\r\n\"... if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is\r\ngoing to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must be made to\r\nyield to business commonsense.\"\r\n16. The duty of the Court is not to delve deep into the intricies of human mind to explore the\r\nundisclosed intention, but only to take the meaning of words used i.e. to say expressed intentions\r\n(Smt. Kamala Devi vs. Seth Takhatmal & Anr2). In seeking to construe a clause in a Contract, there\r\nis no scope for adopting either a liberal or a narrow approach, whatever that may mean. The exercise\r\nwhich has to be undertaken is to determine what the words used mean. It can happen that in doing\r\nso one is driven to the conclusion that clause is ambiguous, and that it has two possible meanings. In\r\nthose circumstances, the Court has to prefer one above the other in accordance with the settled\r\nprinciples. If one meaning is more in accord with what the Court considers to the underlined\r\npurpose and intent of the contract, or part of it, than the other, then the court will 2 1964 (2) SCR\r\n152 15 | P a g e choose former or rather than the later. Ashville Investment v. Elmer Contractors.3\r\nThe intention of the parties must be understood from the language they have used, considered in the\r\nlight of the surrounding circumstances and object of the contract. Bank of India and Anr. v. K.\r\nMohanDas and Ors4. Every contract is to be considered with reference to its object and the whole of\r\nits terms and accordingly the whole context must be considered in endeavoring to collect the\r\nintention of the parties, even though the immediate object of inquiry is the meaning of an isolated\r\nclause. Bihar State Electricity Board, Patna and Ors. v. M\/s. Green Rubber Industries and Ors5.\r\n17. Liquidated damages can be imposed on the Developer under Article 5.8.1 if he is unable to\r\ncommence supply of power to the Appellant by the Scheduled Commissioning Date. Article 12 deals\r\nwith the applicable tariff. The developer shall be entitled to receive the tariff of Rs. 6.10\/kWh of\r\nenergy supplied the Appellant in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If there is delay in\r\ncommissioning of the project beyond the Scheduled Commissioning Date and if there is change in\r\nKERC 3 1988 (2) All ER 577 4 2009 5 SCC 313 5 1990 (1) SCC 731 16 | P a g e applicable tariff,\r\nArticle 12.2 provides that the changed applicable tariff for the project shall be the lower of the Tariff\r\nas in Clause 12.1 and KERC applicable tariff as on the commercial operation day.\r\n18. The bone of contention is whether the Scheduled Commissioning Date of the Solar Power Project\r\nis 16.10.2017 or 17.10.2017. We proceed to advert to the undisputed facts. KERC approved the PPAs\r\non 17.10.2016. Scheduled Commissioning Date according to the agreement should be 12 months\r\nfrom 17.10.2016. There is also no dispute between the parties that 12 months means 365 days.\r\nAccording to the Appellants if 17.10.2016 is included in computation of 365 days, the Scheduled\r\nCommissioning Date is 16.10.2017. On the other hand, the Respondents contended that 17.10.2016\r\nshould be excluded in the calculation of 365 days, in which case, 17.10.2017 would be the Scheduled\r\nCommissioning Date.\r\n19. The Commission relied upon 1.2.1(m) of the PPA to conclude that 17.10.2016 has to be included\r\nfor ciphering the period of 365 days to determine the Scheduled Commissioning Date. Whereas, the\r\nAppellate Tribunal was of the view that Article 1.2.1 (k) of the PPA is relevant. The Tribunal held\r\nthat the date of the event which is the date on 17 | P a g e which the PPA was approved i.e.\r\n17.10.2016 shall be excluded in calculating the period of 12 months.\r\n20. Reduction of applicable tariff is permissible under Article 12.2 of the PPA only when there is\r\ndelay in commissioning of the Project beyond the Scheduled Commissioning Date. As discussed\r\nabove, there is no dispute that the Scheduled Commissioning date shall be 12 months from the\r\neffective date. There is no quarrel between the parties that the effective date is 17.10.2016. The\r\ninterpretation clause contains three provisions which are 1.2.1 (k), 1.2.1 (l) and 1.2.1 (m). According\r\nto 1.2.1 (k), any reference to a month shall mean a reference to a Calendar month as per the\r\nGregorian Calendar. 1.2.1 (l) provides that references to any date or period shall mean and include\r\nsuch date, period as may be extended pursuant to the agreement. As per Article 1.2.1 (m), any\r\nreference to any period commencing from a specified date and until the specified day shall include\r\nboth such day or dates. The other crucial provision which has to be taken note of is the definition of\r\nthe expression \u2018Month\u2019 in Article 21.1 of the agreement. Month has been defined to mean a period of\r\n30 days and excluding (the date of the evet) where applicable, else a Calendar month. We are not\r\nconcerned with 1.2.1 (l), in this case as there is no question of any extension of any period 18 | P a g e\r\npursuant to the agreement. 1.2.1 (k) indicates that any reference to a month shall mean reference to\r\na Calendar month. Reverting to the definition of \u2018Month\u2019, it is clear that a month shall mean either\r\n30 days where applicable or a Calendar month. In this case, there is no dispute that 12 Calendar\r\nmonths have to be taken into account for determining the Scheduled Commissioning Date. The\r\ncrucial expression in the definition of \u2018Month\u2019 is \u201Cexcluding the date of the event\u201D. If the date of the\r\nevent i.e. 17.10.2016 is excluded, the Scheduled Commissioning Date would be 17.10.2017. We do\r\nnot agree with the conclusion of the Commission that the definition of month is with reference only\r\nto one month and not more which is wrong a reading of the provision. The Commission applied 1.2.1\r\n(m) which refers to a period commencing from a specified date to a specified day for the purpose of\r\nincluding the date of the event. In our view, the Commission has committed an error in applying\r\n1.2.1 (m) when the provision that is applicable is 1.2.1 (k) read with the definition of month in Article\r\n21.1. There is a specific mention of \u2018twelve months\u2019 in the definition of \u2018SCOD\u2019 and Article 1.2.1 (k)\r\ncategorically provides that any reference to a \u2018Month\u2019 shall be a calendar month. Applicability of\r\nArticle 1.2.1 (k) excludes the operation of Article 1.2.1 (m) to the facts of this case.\r\n19 | P a g e\r\n21. The next contention of the Appellant is that actual injection of power into the Grid was on\r\n17.10.2017 and as the Scheduled is 16.10.2017, the reduction of the tariff in view of the delay of 1 day\r\nin commissioning is justified. The alternate submission that is made by the Respondents that even\r\nassuming that the Scheduled Commissioning Date is 16.10.2017 and not 17.10.2017, the\r\nRespondents commissioned the Solar Plants on 16.10.2017 itself. According to the Respondents, the\r\nAppellant committed an error in penalizing the Respondents on a wrong premise that the actual\r\ninjection of power is required to show that the Solar Plants were commissioned. The Commission\r\nanswered the point in favour of the Appellants by holding that actual injection of power is necessary\r\nto determine the date of commissioning of the Plant. The Appellate Tribunal reversed the findings\r\nrecorded by the Commission on this aspect by relying upon the Commissioning certificate issued by\r\nthe KPTCL which is to the effect that the Solar Plants were commissioned on 16.10.2017 itself. There\r\nis no dispute that the power was injected from the solar plants on 17.10.2017. In view of the\r\nconclusion reached by us on the issue relating to the Scheduled Commissioning Date being\r\n17.10.2017, it is not necessary to adjudicate the point relating to the 20 | P a g e requirement of\r\nactual injection of power into the Grid to decide the date of commissioning. At the request of Mr.\r\nBalaji Srinivasan, learned counsel for the Appellant, four weeks time is granted to implement the\r\njudgment of the Appellate Tribunal.\r\n22. For the aforesaid reasons, the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal is upheld and the Appeals are\r\ndismissed.\r\n..................................J. [ L.

          "judgement":"SANJIV KHANNA, J.\r\nThe legal issue which arises for consideration in the present appeal is whether K. Veluswamy, as a\r\nKarta, has legal authority to execute agreement to sell dated 8 th December 2006 for sale of the suit\r\nland, being agricultural land \u2013 (i) Sy.No. 7\/1P1, measuring 4 acres, 21 guntas of land; (ii) Sy.No.\r\n7\/1P2 measuring 5 acres of land; and (iii) Sy.No. 8\/3P3 measuring 2 acres of land, in all 11 acres 21\r\nguntas of wet land, situated in Bagganadu Kaval Village, J.G. Hally Hobli, Hiriyur Taluk,\r\nChitradurga District, Karnataka.\r\n2. It is an accepted position that on 8 th December 2006, K. Veluswamy as a Karta of the joint\r\nHindu family had executed the agreement to sell of the suit property for Rs.29 lakhs and had\r\nreceived Rs.4 lakhs in advance from Beereddy Dasaratharami Reddy, the appellant before us. K.\r\nVeluswamy, the second respondent before us, has not entered appearance and contested this appeal.\r\nThe appeal is contested by the first respondent before us, namely V. Manjunath, who is the son of K.\r\nVeluswamy. (For convenience, K. Veluswamy and V. Manjunath, wherever required have been\r\ncollectively referred to the respondents).3. On 26th November 2007, Beereddy Dasaratharmi Reddy instituted the suit for specific\r\nperformance of the agreement to sell impleading both K. Veluswamy and V. Manjunath. The Court\r\nof Senior Civil Judge, Hiriyur decreed the suit vide judgment dated 22nd January 2013 rejecting the\r\ndefence that the agreement was a camouflage for a loan agreement as K. Veluswamy was in need of\r\nmoney for construction of a farm house. K. Veluswamy as the Karta of the joint Hindu family\r\nproperty was entitled to execute the agreement to sell, which agreement being on account of legal\r\nnecessity is valid.\r\n4. K. Veluswamy accepted the decision. His son V. Manjunath preferred the regular first appeal\r\nbefore the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru and vide the judgment under challenge dated 6th\r\nMarch 2021 he has succeeded. The impugned judgment, while accepting that K. Veluswamy did\r\nexecute the agreement to sell for the suit property for Rs.29 lakhs and had received Rs.4 lakhs as\r\nadvance, held that the agreement to sell is un- enforceable as the suit property belongs to the joint\r\nHindu family consisting of three persons, K. Veluswamy, his wife V. Manimegala and his son V.\r\nManjunath and, therefore, could not have been executed without the signatures of V. Manjunath.\r\nRelying on Pemmada Prabhakar and Others v. Youngmen\u2019s Vysya Association and Others,1 it was\r\nheld that legal necessity is not proved. Execution of the agreement to sell by K. Veluswamy as a\r\nKarta of the joint Hindu family is held not established as no issue on the aspect of authority of the\r\nKarta to execute agreement to sell and legal necessity was framed. Consequently, it was held that the\r\nsuit must be dismissed.\r\n5. The agreement to sell, which is an admitted document and marked Exhibit P-1, it is accepted, was\r\nsigned and executed by K. Veluswamy and his wife V. Manimegala. P.B. Basavarajaiah, 1 (2015) 5\r\nSCC 355 father-in-law of V. Veluswamy, had also signed the agreement to sell. Payment of Rs. 4 lacs\r\nby Beereddy Dasaratharmi Reddy and receipt of the said amount by K. Veluswamy as advance is\r\nalso not disputed. Remaining amount of Rs.25 lakhs was to be paid within three months and the sale\r\ndeed executed and registered. The agreement to sell states that the subject property is a joint Hindu\r\nfamily property, enjoyed jointly and that the Katha is in the joint names. What is significant and\r\nimportant is the avowal by the executants that they were in need of funds to meet the domestic\r\nnecessities and, consequently, had agreed to sell the suit property. If any dispute arises with regard\r\nto the sale transaction, it would be solved by the executants personally at their own risk and cost.\r\nLastly, if there was any loan, mortgage, revenue arrears, etc. over the property, the same shall be\r\ncleared by the executants so as to execute and register the sale deed in favour of Beereddy\r\nDasaratharami Reddy. The agreement to sell does mention that it would be also executed by V.\r\nManjunath, and it is a fact that it is not signed and executed by him, but this, as discussed below,\r\nwould not nullify the rights and liabilities arising from the agreement to sell.\r\n6. Right of the Karta to execute agreement to sell or sale deed of a joint Hindu family property is\r\nsettled and is beyond cavil vide several judgments of this Court including Sri Narayan Bal and\r\nOthers v. Sridhar Sutar and Others,2 wherein it has been held that a joint Hindu family is capable of\r\nacting through its Karta or adult member of the family in management of the joint Hindu family\r\nproperty. A coparcener who has right to claim a share in the joint Hindu family estate cannot seek\r\ninjunction against the Karta restraining him from dealing with or entering into a transaction from\r\nsale of the joint Hindu family property, albeit post alienation has a right to challenge the alienation\r\nif the same is not for legal necessity or for betterment of the estate. Where a Karta has alienated a\r\njoint Hindu family property for value either for legal necessity or benefit of the estate it would bind\r\nthe interest of all undivided members of the family even when they are minors or widows. There are\r\nno specific grounds that establish the existence of legal necessity and the existence of legal necessity\r\ndepends upon facts of each case. The Karta enjoys wide discretion in his decision over existence of\r\nlegal necessity and as to in what way such necessity can be fulfilled. The exercise of powers given the\r\nrights of the Karta on fulfilling the requirement of legal necessity or betterment of the estate is valid\r\nand binding on other coparceners.\r\n7. Elucidating the position in Hindu law, this Court in Kehar Singh (D) through Legal\r\nRepresentatives and Others v. Nachittar 2 (1996) 8 SCC 54 Kaur and Others3 has referred to Mulla\r\non Hindu Law and the concept of legal necessity to observe thus:\r\n\u201C20. Mulla in his classic work Hindu Law while dealing with the right of a father to\r\nalienate any ancestral property said in Article 254, which reads as under:\r\n\u201CArticle 254\r\n254. Alienation by father.\u2014 A Hindu father as such has special powers of alienating\r\ncoparcenary property, which no other coparcener has. In the exercise of these powers\r\nhe may:\r\n(1) make a gift of ancestral movable property to the extent mentioned in Article 223,\r\nand even of ancestral immovable property to the extent mentioned in Article 224;\r\n(2) sell or mortgage ancestral property, whether movable or immovable, including\r\nthe interest of his sons, grandsons and great-grandsons therein, for the payment of\r\nhis own debt, provided the debt was an antecedent debt, and was not incurred for\r\nimmoral or illegal purposes (Article 294).\u201D\r\n21. What is legal necessity was also succinctly said by Mulla in Article 241, which\r\nreads as under:\r\n\u201CArticle 241\r\n241. What is legal necessity.\u2014The following have been held to be family necessities\r\nwithin the meaning of Article 240:\r\n(a) payment of government revenue and of debts which are payable out of the family\r\nproperty;\r\n(b) maintenance of coparceners and of the members of their families;\r\n(c) marriage expenses of male coparceners, and of the daughters of coparceners;\r\n(d) performance of the necessary funeral or family ceremonies;\r\n(e) costs of necessary litigation in recovering or preserving the estate;\r\n(f) costs of defending the head of the joint family or any other member against a serious criminal\r\ncharge;\r\n(g) payment of debts incurred for family business or other necessary purpose. In the case of a\r\nmanager other than a father, it is not enough to show merely that the debt is a pre-existing debt;\r\nThe above are not the only indices for concluding as to whether the alienation was indeed for legal\r\nnecessity, nor can the enumeration of criterion for establishing legal necessity be copious or even\r\npredictable. It must therefore depend on the facts of each case. When, therefore, property is sold in\r\norder to fulfil tax obligations incurred by a family business, such alienation can be classified as\r\nconstituting legal necessity.\u201D (See Hindu Law by Mulla \u201C22nd Edition\u201D) xx xx xx\r\n26. Once the factum of existence of legal necessity stood proved, then, in our view, no co-coparcener\r\n(son) has a right to challenge the sale made by the karta of his family. The plaintiff being a son was\r\none of the co-coparceners along with his father Pritam Singh. He had no right to challenge such sale\r\nin the light of findings of legal necessity being recorded against him. It was more so when the\r\nplaintiff failed to prove by any evidence that there was no legal necessity for sale of the suit land or\r\nthat the evidence adduced by the defendants to prove the factum of existence of legal necessity was\r\neither insufficient or irrelevant or no evidence at all.\u201D\r\n8. The aforesaid being the legal position, it has to be held that signatures of V. Manjunath, son of\r\nKarta \u2013 K. Veluswamy, on the agreement to sell were not required. K. Veluswamy being the Karta\r\nwas entitled to execute the agreement to sell and even alienate the suit property. Absence of\r\nsignatures of V. Manjunath would not matter and is inconsequential. As noted above, it is an\r\naccepted case of the respondents that K. Veluswamy did receive Rs.4 lakhs as advance from Beeredy\r\nDasartharami Reddy, as recorded in the agreement to sell.\r\n9. On the question of satisfaction of the condition of legal necessity, the stand of the respondents is\r\ncontradictory, for they have pleaded in the written statement and even before us that the joint\r\nHindu family was in need of funds, which shows legal necessity. In fact, as recorded above, the need\r\nfor funds is duly reflected and so stated in the agreement to sell dated 8 th December 2006 which\r\nstates that the executants were in need of funds to meet domestic necessities and, therefore, had\r\nagreed to sell the suit property. It is also an undisputed position that the suit property was\r\nencumbered in favour of the State Bank of Mysore, Adivala Branch, and the executants had\r\ninformed that the dues of the bank would be cleared to release the mortgage before the date of\r\nregistration. In Kehar Singh (supra), on the question what is legal necessity, reference was made to\r\nArticle 241 from Mulla\u2019s Hindu Law which states that maintenance of coparceners, family members,\r\nmarriage expenses, performance of necessary funerals or family ceremonies, costs of necessary\r\nlitigation for recovering or preserving estate, etc. fall and have been held to be family\u2019s necessities.\r\nFurther, the instances are not the only indices for concluding whether the alienation was in need for\r\nlegal necessity as enumeration on what would be legal necessity is unpredictable and would depend\r\nupon facts of each case. Thus, we are of the opinion that the agreement to sell cannot be set aside on\r\nthe ground of absence of legal necessity.\r\n10. Decision of this Court in Pemmada Prabhakar (supra) has no application, being a case of\r\nintestate property inherited by wife, three sons and three daughters as class I heirs under Section 8\r\nof the Hindu Succession Act and the agreement to sell was not signed by wife, one son and three\r\ndaughters and, therefore, neither binding nor enforceable against the non-executants. The ratio\r\nwould not apply to a joint Hindu family property.\r\n11. Omission to frame an issue as required under Order XIV Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\r\n1908 does not vitiate the trial where the parties go to trial fully knowing the rival case and lead\r\nevidence in support of their respective contentions and to refute contentions of the other side (See \u2013\r\nKannan (Dead) by LRs. and Others v. V.S. Pandurangam (Dead) by LRs. and Others 4 and Nedunuri\r\nKameswaramma v. Sampati Subba Rao5).\r\n12. We are informed that during the pendency of the present appeal, the suit property has been\r\ntransferred to a third person, which transfer would obviously be subject to and hit by the doctrine of\r\nlis pendens. Therefore, once we set aside the impugned judgment and restore the judgment of the\r\ntrial court, the respondents would be bound to perform their obligations under the agreement to sell\r\ndated 8th December 2006 and execute the registered sale deed, notwithstanding any transaction\r\nwhich the respondents have executed.\r\n13. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we allow the present appeal and set aside the impugned\r\njudgment and decree and restore the judgment and decree passed by the trial court. The appellant\r\nwould deposit the balance sale consideration of Rs.25 lakhs in the 4 (2007) 15 SCC 157 5 AIR 1963\r\nSC 884 trial court within a period of eight weeks from today, which amount once deposited would be\r\nkept in an interest bearing fixed deposit and would be handed over\/paid to K. Veluswamy, Karta of\r\nthe joint Hindu family at the time of execution of the sale deed by him in favour of the\r\nappellant\/Beereddy Dasartharami Reddy. The appellant\/Beereddy Dasartharami Reddy will also\r\nbear necessary expenses like stamp duty, registration charges for execution of the sale deed. Physical\r\npossession of the property would be handed over by the respondents to the appellant\/Beereddy\r\nDasartharami Reddy along with the execution of the sale deed, notwithstanding that the suit\r\nproperty has been sold to a third person during the pendency of the present appeal.\r\n14. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms without any order as to costs.\r\n......................................J. (M.R. SHAH) ......................................J.

          "judgement":"B.R. GAVAI, J.\r\n1. The appellant has approached this Court, being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 19 th\r\nDecember 2017, passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in\r\nCriminal Appeal No. 1684 of 2017, thereby dismissing the appeal preferred by the appellant\r\nchallenging the judgment and order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as the \u201Ctrial judge\u201D) dated 4th April 2017, vide which the appellant was convicted for the\r\noffences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 201 and Section 506\u2212B of the Indian Penal\r\nCode, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as the \u201CIPC\u201D). The trial judge had awarded death sentence to the\r\nappellant for the offences punishable under Section 302 of the IPC (3 counts) and 7 years\u2019 rigorous\r\nimprisonment each for the offences punishable under Sections 201 and 506\u2212B of the IPC\r\nrespectively. The trial judge has also made a reference being CRRFC No. 03 of 2017 to the High\r\nCourt under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as\r\n\u201CCr.P.C.\u201D) for confirmation of death penalty. Vide impugned judgment and order, the High Court\r\nconfirmed the death penalty.\r\n2. The prosecution story in brief, is thus:\r\nAppellant\u2212Bhagchandra is the real brother of deceased Thakur Das and deceased\r\nDevki Prasad. Deceased Akhilesh was the son of deceased Devki Prasad and as such,\r\nthe nephew of the appellant. PW\u22121\u2212Kiran Patel is the wife of deceased Devki Prasad.\r\nPW\u22122\u2212Urmila and PW\u22123\u2212Kamlesh are the daughter and son of deceased Devki\r\nPrasad and Kiran Patel (PW\u22121).\r\n3. Deceased Devki Prasad resided in village Pur along with his brother deceased Thakur Das, his\r\nwife PW\u22121\u2212Kiran Patel, daughter PW\u22122\u2212Urmila, sons PW\u22123\u2212Kamlesh, deceased Akhilesh, and\r\nKisiyabai, mother of the appellant.\r\n4. It is the prosecution case that on the fateful early morning of 11th October 2015 at around 05.00\u2212\r\n05.30 am, complainant\u2212Kiran Patel (PW\u22121) had gone to attend the call of nature. While returning,\r\nshe saw the appellant armed with an axe getting out of her house. It is the prosecution case that\r\nthere was previous enmity between the appellant on one hand and deceased Thakur Das and\r\ndeceased Devki Prasad on the other. She therefore suspected some foul play. Immediately after\r\nentering the house, she saw Thakur Das lying dead smeared with blood and his neck was detached\r\nfrom the body. In the courtyard, she also found her son Akhilesh lying dead. It is the prosecution\r\ncase that deceased Devki Prasad had gone to his field in the night so as to guard the crops.\r\nSuspecting something might be done to him, PW\u2212 1 rushed towards the field which was nearby the\r\nhouse. She saw the appellant assaulting her husband Devki Prasad with an axe. She tried to stop the\r\nappellant but he threatened to kill her. In the meanwhile, the relatives and the neighbours had\r\ngathered at the spot.\r\n5. Immediately after the incident, a First Information Report (hereinafter referred to as \u201CFIR\u201D) came\r\nto be registered on the basis of the oral complaint given by Kiran Patel (PW\u2212\r\n1), in the Police Station, Maharajpur. After investigation, charge\u2212sheet came to be filed before the\r\nconcerned court which committed the case to the Sessions Judge.\r\n6. The trial judge framed charges against the appellant under Sections 302 (3 counts), 201 and 506\r\nPart\u2212II of the IPC. The appellant denied all the charges and claimed that he was falsely implicated\r\nby Kiran Patel (PW\u22121) to grab the property.\r\n7. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge found the appellant guilty of committing the offences\r\nhe was charged with and as such, awarded sentences as stated hereinabove. The trial court also\r\nmade a Reference being CRRFC No. 03 of 2017 to the High Court for confirmation of the capital\r\npunishment awarded by it.\r\n8. Being aggrieved by the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court, the\r\nappellant preferred an appeal being Criminal Appeal No. 1684 of 2017 before the High Court. The\r\nHigh Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the death penalty awarded by the trial court. Being\r\naggrieved thereby, the present appeal.\r\n9. We have heard Shri N. Hariharan, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellant\r\nand Smt. Swarupama Chaturvedi, learned Assistant Advocate General, appearing on behalf of the\r\nrespondent\u2212State.10. Shri Hariharan would submit that the entire case against the appellant is a fabricated one and\r\nhas been framed at the instance of Kiran Patel (PW\u22121). The learned Senior Counsel submitted that\r\nthe evidence as placed on record by the prosecution does not establish the guilt of the accused\u2212\r\nappellant beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n11. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that firstly, the time of the incident as shown by the\r\nprosecution is itself doubtful. He submitted that the Post\u2212Mortem Report of all the three deceased\r\npersons would show that semi\u2212digested food was found in the stomach of the deceased persons. He\r\ntherefore submitted that the death would have occurred around 3\u22124 hours after their last meal. He\r\nsubmitted that from the evidence brought on record, it would show that deceased Devki Prasad had\r\nleft for the field at around 09.00 pm. He submitted that therefore the deceased must have taken\r\ntheir meal at around 09.00 pm. As such, the death has occurred between 12.00 midnight and 01.00\r\nam.\r\n12. He further submitted that there are material contradictions in the testimonies of PW\u22121\u2212Kiran\r\nPatel, PW\u22122\u2212 Urmila and PW\u22123\u2212Kamlesh. He submitted that even the conduct of PW\u22121 is\r\nunnatural. She has stated that, while going to answer the call of nature, she had put a latch to close\r\nthe door of the house. He submitted that normally a person would not do such an act. He further\r\nsubmitted that the evidence of PW\u22127\u2212Rakesh Vishwakarma is totally unnatural. From the evidence\r\nof PW\u22127, it is clear that though he has witnessed the incident, he has not informed the same to the\r\npolice, who were very much available in the village. He has only informed PW\u22126\u2212Kamlesh Patel s\/o\r\nGulabchandra Patel (for the sake of convenience, hereinafter referred to as \u201CKamlesh\u2212II\u201D). He\r\nsubmitted that it is clear that PW\u22127 is an introduced witness.\r\n13. Shri Hariharan further submitted that the prosecution has withheld the most important witness\r\ni.e. Kisiyabai, mother of deceased Thakur Das and Devki Prasad as well as the appellant, though her\r\nstatement was recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. He submitted that since the prosecution has\r\nwithheld an important witness, an adverse inference needs to be drawn against the prosecution. The\r\nlearned Senior Counsel, in this respect, relies on the judgment of this Court in the case of Pratap\r\nSingh and Another v. State of Madhya Pradesh1.\r\n14. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that the so\u2212 called recovery of axe on the memorandum of\r\nappellant 1 (2005) 13 SCC 624 under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as the \u201CEvidence Act\u201D) is also of no relevance. He submitted that firstly, the Serology\r\nReport does not support the prosecution case. He submitted that the recovery on memorandum\r\nwould be relevant only if the prosecution is in a position to establish that the article recovered was\r\nused in the crime. He submitted that apart from the Serology Report not supporting the prosecution\r\ncase, the said axe has not been put to any of the witnesses to establish that it was the same weapon\r\nwhich was used in the crime.\r\n15. Shri Hariharan would submit that the trial court as well as the High Court has not considered the\r\nevidence in its correct perspective. He submitted that the evidence has been considered in a totally\r\nerroneous manner. He submitted that though this Court is exercising the jurisdiction under Article\r\n136 of the Constitution of India, since the matter pertains to death penalty, it is necessary that this\r\nCourt should reappreciate the entire evidence. He relies on the judgments of this Court in the cases\r\nof Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab alias Abu Mujahid v. State of Maharashtra 2,\r\nDayanidhi Bisoi v. State of Orissa 3 and Mohd. Arif alias Ashfaq v. Registrar, Supreme Court of\r\nIndia and Others4.\r\n16. Shri Hariharan, in the alternative, submitted that in no circumstances, the death penalty was\r\nwarranted in the facts of the present case. He submitted that firstly, the trial court has imposed the\r\ndeath penalty on the same day on which the conviction was recorded. He submitted that a sufficient\r\nperiod of time between the order of conviction and the sentence ought to have been given to the\r\nappellant so that the appellant would have availed of his right to point out the aggravating and\r\nmitigating circumstances. He further submitted that the courts below have also failed to take into\r\nconsideration that the accused was not a hardened criminal. The accused did not have any criminal\r\nantecedents and it was his first crime. He further submitted that the trial court as well as the High\r\nCourt has not taken into consideration 2 (2012) 9 SCC 1 3 (2003) 9 SCC 310 4 (2014) 9 SCC 737 the\r\npossibility of the appellant being reformed. It is therefore submitted that the death penalty is not\r\nwarranted at all in the facts and circumstances of the present case.\r\n17. Smt. Chaturvedi, on the contrary, submitted that both the courts below have rightly convicted\r\nthe appellant and also awarded death penalty. She submitted that minor inconsistencies in the\r\nevidence of the witnesses should not be given much importance. She further submitted that when\r\nocular evidence has been found by the court to be cogent, trustworthy and reliable, then some\r\ninconsistencies in the medical evidence would not be relevant. She relies on the judgment of this\r\nCourt in the case of Krishnan and Another v. State represented by Inspector of Police 5 to assert the\r\nsaid contention. She further submitted that merely because the Serology Report is not conclusive, it\r\ncannot be a ground to disbelieve the prosecution case. For the said proposition, she relies on the\r\njudgment of this Court in the case of R. Shaji v. State of Kerala6.\r\n5 (2003) 7 SCC 56 6 (2013) 14 SCC 266\r\n18. Smt. Chaturvedi, in order to meet the challenge about the evidence of PW\u22127\u2212Rakesh, submitted\r\nthat the reaction of a witness to a situation may differ from person to person. She submitted that\r\nmerely because PW\u22127\u2212Rakesh has informed PW\u22126\u2212Kamlesh first, which was prior to informing the\r\npolice, it does not put a dent on his testimony. For this, she relies on the judgment of this Court in\r\nthe case of Rammi alias Rameshwar v. State of Madhya Pradesh7.\r\n19. She further submitted that taking into consideration the brutality of murder, wherein three\r\nblood relatives have been done away with for no fault of theirs, warrants no lesser penalty than the\r\ndeath penalty. She submitted that the necks of all the three persons were segregated due to the\r\nbrutal attack and as such, the trial court has rightly awarded death penalty and the High Court has\r\nrightly confirmed the same. She relies on the judgment of this Court in the case of Ravi s\/o Ashok\r\nGhumare v. State of Maharashtra8.\r\n20. Shri Hariharan, in rejoinder, submitted that in view of the law laid down by this Court, relevant\r\nmaterial is required 7 (1999) 8 SCC 649 8 (2019) 9 SCC 622 to be placed before the court while\r\nconsidering as to whether the death penalty should be awarded or not. He submitted that\r\naccordingly, an affidavit of the close relatives of the appellant has been placed on record. He further\r\nsubmitted that the certificate from the prison authority is also placed on record which would show\r\nthat the conduct of the appellant is satisfactory, not warranting death penalty.\r\n21. With the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties, we have examined the materials placed\r\non record.\r\n22. PW\u22121\u2212Kiran Patel is the wife of deceased Devki Prasad. She has stated in her evidence that on\r\nthe date of the incident, at around 05.00 am, she had gone out to answer the call of nature. At that\r\ntime, her brother\u2212in\u2212law Thakur Das, sons Akhilesh and Kamlesh, daughter Urmila and mother\u2212\r\nin\u2212law Kisiyabai were sleeping at home. When she returned after around 10 minutes, she saw\r\nappellant armed with an axe coming out of her house. She suspected some foul play. When she\r\nentered the house, she saw her brother\u2212 in\u2212law Thakur Das lying dead in outer room. His neck was\r\ncut. When she came in the courtyard, she saw her son Akhilesh dead, having injuries on his neck\r\nand head. She stated that her son Kamlesh and daughter Urmila had gone to the place of Gulab after\r\nseeing the appellant assaulting their uncle and brother. Both of them came and informed her that\r\nThakur Das and Akhilesh were assaulted by the appellant. She suspected that the appellant had gone\r\ntowards the field and therefore, she followed the appellant towards the field. She saw the appellant\r\nassaulting her husband Devki Prasad with the axe. When she tried to stop the accused from\r\nassaulting the deceased, the accused abused her and told her to go away and threatened her that she\r\nwould also meet the same fate. She stated that when she was returning home, she saw PW\u22127\u2212\r\nRakesh. Thereafter, PW\u22124\u2212Rammilan, PW\u22125\u2212Khillu Patel and PW\u22126\u2212Kamlesh\u2212II also came. She\r\nhas further stated in her evidence that deceased Thakur Das was residing with the appellant for 10\r\nyears. However, the appellant started demanding the land of Thakur Das and his tractor. As such,\r\nthe appellant forced Thakur Das to leave his house. Thereafter, Thakur Das had started residing\r\nwith the family of deceased Devki Prasad. She has stated that the appellant thought that Thakur\r\nDas\u2019s property would come to the family of Devki Prasad and so, the appellant had assaulted and\r\nkilled her brother\u2212in\u2212law, her husband and son. PW\u22121 has been cross\u2212examined at length.\r\nHowever, in spite of lengthy cross\u2212examination, her evidence insofar as the incident is concerned,\r\nhas gone unchallenged.\r\n23. PW\u22122\u2212Urmila was about 11\u221212 years old at the time of incident. After putting preliminary\r\nquestions to her, the trial judge found that she was capable of understanding the questions and\r\nanswering the same and as such, her statement was recorded without administering oath to her.\r\n24. She stated that on the day of the incident, after her mother went to answer the call of nature, she\r\nwas doing the household work. She heard the sound of \u2018dham dham\u2019 and thought that it might be a\r\ndog\u2019s sound. She went towards the place from where the sound was coming and saw that the\r\nappellant was assaulting the deceased with an axe. Her brother Akhilesh was sleeping in the\r\ncourtyard. She tried to wake him up but he did not get up. The appellant came to the courtyard\r\nalong with the axe and started assaulting Akhilesh. She got frightened and therefore went to PW\u22126\u2212\r\nKamlesh\u2212II\u2019s house. Her brother Kamlesh (PW\u22123) had also woken up. He also tried to wake\r\nAkhilesh up but he did not get up. The appellant tried to catch hold of Kamlesh (PW\u22123) too,\r\nhowever, Kamlesh (PW\u22123) ran away with Urmila to Kamlesh\u2212II\u2019s house. She further stated that\r\nthereafter, her mother came. She informed about the incident to her mother. Thereafter, her mother\r\nwent to the field. She stated that her mother saw the appellant assaulting the deceased. Thereafter,\r\nher mother came home and started shouting and raising hue and cry. As such, PW\u22126\u2212Kamlesh\u2212II\r\nand PW\u22124\u2212 Rammilan came there. The said child witness has also been thoroughly cross\u2212\r\nexamined. However, her evidence insofar as the main incident is concerned, has gone unchallenged.\r\nSimilar is the evidence of PW\u22123\u2212Kamlesh who was aged 12\u221213 years at the time of the incident.\r\n25. It will be thus clear from the evidence of PW\u22121\u2212Kiran Patel, that she has personally witnessed\r\nthe appellant assaulting deceased Devki Prasad. It will be further clear from the evidence of PW\u22122\u2212\r\nUrmila and PW\u22123\u2212Kamlesh that they have personally witnessed the appellant assaulting deceased\r\nThakur Das and deceased Akhilesh. The evidence of these three witnesses would also reveal that\r\nimmediately after PW\u22121 came from field, she was informed by PW\u22122 and PW\u22123 about the assault\r\nby the appellant on Thakur Das and Akhilesh. The testimony of these three witnesses is duly\r\ncorroborated by the other witnesses. PW\u22124\u2212Rammilan is the son of Shyambihari. Shyambihari is\r\nanother brother of deceased Thakur Das, deceased Devki Prasad and appellant Bhagchandra. He\r\nhas stated in his deposition that on the date of incident when he was going out at around 5.30 am,\r\nhis aunt Kiran Patel was shouting maar dala, maar dala. When he went near his aunt Kiran Patel, he\r\nsaw that inside the house, Thakur Das and Akhilesh were lying dead. When he went to the field, he\r\nsaw Devki Prasad lying dead in front of the tractor. He stated that Kiran informed him about the\r\nincident. This witness had accompanied PW\u22121 to the Police Station for lodging the report. This\r\nwitness has also undergone lengthy cross\u2212examination. Nothing damaging has come on record in\r\nthe cross\u2212examination. This witness would be in a sense a neutral witness inasmuch as his relation\r\nwith both, the appellant and the deceased, is of the same degree. PW\u22121 had immediately disclosed\r\nabout the incident to him and he had accompanied her to lodge the FIR.\r\n26. Similar is the testimony of PW\u22125\u2212Khillu Patel.\r\n27. PW\u22126\u2212Kamlesh\u2212II is also related to the witnesses, deceased and the appellant. He stated that on\r\nthe date of the incident at around 04.00 am, he had gone to answer the call of nature. While\r\nreturning, he received a message on his mobile and in that light, he saw the appellant running\r\ntowards him. On him questioning the appellant as to what he was doing there, the appellant said, \u201CI\r\nthought that you are Thakur Das\u201D. At that time, the appellant was having an axe with him.\r\nThereafter, PW\u22126 came home and was resting. At around 05.00\u221205.30 am, the children of Devki\r\nPrasad namely Urmila (PW\u22122) and Akhilesh (PW\u22123) came to him. Both were frightened and told\r\nhim that Bhagchandra uncle had hacked Thakur Das and Akhilesh with the axe. He further stated\r\nthat he too was afraid as he was alone and could not do anything. He stated that in the meantime,\r\nKiran Bhabhi had come and informed about the incident.\r\n28. It could thus be seen that all these witnesses establish the presence of each other. PW\u22121\u2212Kiran\r\nPatel stated about the presence of PW\u22124\u2212Rammilan, PW\u22125\u2212Khillu Patel and PW\u2212 6\u2212Kamlesh\u2212II\r\nand about them immediately coming to the spot and her informing them about the incident. PWs 4,\r\n5 and 6 corroborated the testimony of PW\u22121 in that aspect. PW\u22122\u2212 Urmila and PW\u22123\u2212Kamlesh\r\nstated about witnessing the incident of appellant assaulting deceased Thakur Das and Akhilesh, and\r\nrunning towards the house of Kamlesh\u2212II and informing him about the same. PW\u22126 too\r\ncorroborated this version of PWs 1, 2 and 3.\r\n29. Insofar as the evidence of PW\u22127\u2212Rakesh is concerned, we find that the conduct of the said\r\nwitness appears to be somewhat unnatural. He stated that after witnessing the incident, he had gone\r\nto another village on motorcycle to see his friend. From there, he had gone to the Hospital at\r\nMaharajpur. After that, he came home at around 10.00\u2212 10.30 am. Though, the police were present\r\nin the village, he did not inform them about the incident. On his own, he stated that he had informed\r\nKamlesh\u2212II about the incident. We therefore find that it will not be appropriate to rely on his\r\ntestimony. However, even if the testimony of PW\u22127 is eschewed, we find that the ocular testimonies\r\nof PWs 1 to 6 establish the case of the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt that it is the appellant\r\nwho had assaulted the deceased persons.\r\n30. No doubt that there are minor discrepancies in the evidence of these PWs. It will be relevant to\r\nrefer to the following observations of this Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. Krishna\r\nMaster and Others9:\u2212 \u201C15. Before appreciating evidence of the witnesses examined in the case, it\r\nwould be instructive to refer to the criteria for appreciation of oral evidence. While appreciating the\r\nevidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole\r\nappears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is found, it is undoubtedly necessary for the\r\ncourt to scrutinise the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and\r\ninfirmities 9 (2010) 12 SCC 324 pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out\r\nwhether it is against the general tenor of the evidence and whether the earlier evaluation of the\r\nevidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not\r\ntouching the core of the case, hypertechnical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here\r\nor there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the\r\ninvestigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the\r\nevidence as a whole.\r\n16. If the court before whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion\r\nabout the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this\r\nbenefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and unless\r\nthe reasons are weighty and formidable, it would not be proper for the appellate court to reject the\r\nevidence on the ground of variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. Minor omissions\r\nin the police statements are never considered to be fatal. The statements given by the witnesses\r\nbefore the police are meant to be brief statements and could not take place of evidence in the court.\r\nSmall\/Trivial omissions would not justify a finding by court that the witnesses concerned are liars.\r\nThe prosecution evidence may suffer from inconsistencies here and discrepancies there, but that is a\r\nshortcoming from which no criminal case is free. The main thing to be seen is whether those\r\ninconsistencies go to the root of the matter or pertain to insignificant aspects thereof. In the former\r\ncase, the defence may be justified in seeking advantage of incongruities obtaining in the evidence. In\r\nthe latter, however, no such benefit may be available to it.\r\n17. In the deposition of witnesses, there are always normal discrepancies, howsoever honest and\r\ntruthful they may be. These discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation, normal errors of\r\nmemory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition, shock and horror at the time of occurrence\r\nand threat to the life. It is not unoften that improvements in earlier version are made at the trial in\r\norder to give a boost to the prosecution case, albeit foolishly. Therefore, it is the duty of the court to\r\nseparate falsehood from the truth. In sifting the evidence, the court has to attempt to separate the\r\nchaff from the grains in every case and this attempt cannot be abandoned on the ground that the\r\ncase is baffling unless the evidence is really so confusing or conflicting that the process cannot\r\nreasonably be carried out. In the light of these principles, this Court will have to determine whether\r\nthe evidence of eyewitnesses examined in this case proves the prosecution case.\u201D [emphasis\r\nsupplied]\r\n31. It could thus be seen that what is required to be considered is whether the evidence of the\r\nwitness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. It has been held that minor discrepancies on\r\ntrivial matters not touching the core of the case, hypertechnical approach by taking sentences torn\r\nout of context here or there from the evidence, would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence\r\nas a whole. It has been held that the prosecution evidence may suffer from inconsistencies here and\r\ndiscrepancies there, but that is a shortcoming from which no criminal case is free. What is\r\nimportant is to see as to whether those inconsistencies go to the root of the matter or pertain to\r\ninsignificant aspects thereof. It has been held that there are always normal discrepancies due to\r\nnormal errors of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental\r\ndisposition, shock and horror at the time of occurrence. It is the duty of the court to separate\r\nfalsehood from the truth in every case.\r\n32. Applying these principles, we are of the view that the minor discrepancies in the evidence of the\r\nprosecution witnesses are not of such a nature which would persuade this Court to disbelieve their\r\ntestimonies. It is further to be noted that the witnesses are rustic villagers and some inconsistencies\r\nin their depositions are bound to be there.\r\n33. In this respect, it will be apposite to refer to the following observations of this Court in the case\r\nof Krishna Master (supra):\r\n\u201C23. The record of the case shows that this witness Jhabbulal was cross\u2212examined at\r\ngreat length. He was subjected to gruelling cross\u2212examination which runs into 31\r\npages. The first and firm impression which one gathers on reading the testimony of\r\nthis witness is that he is a rustic witness. A rustic witness, who is subjected to\r\nfatiguing, taxing and tiring cross\u2212examination for days together, is bound to get\r\nconfused and make some inconsistent statements. Some discrepancies are bound to\r\ntake place if a witness is cross\u2212examined at length for days together. Therefore, the\r\ndiscrepancies noticed in the evidence of a rustic witness who is subjected to gruelling\r\ncross\u2212examination should not be blown out of proportion. To do so is to ignore hard\r\nrealities of village life and give undeserved benefit to the accused who have\r\nperpetrated heinous crime.\r\n24. The basic principle of appreciation of evidence of a rustic witness who is not\r\neducated and comes from a poor strata of society is that the evidence of such a\r\nwitness should be appreciated as a whole.\r\nThe rustic witness as compared to an educated witness is not expected to remember every small\r\ndetail of the incident and the manner in which the incident had happened more particularly when\r\nhis evidence is recorded after a lapse of time. Further, a witness is bound to face shock of the\r\nuntimely death of his near relative(s). Therefore, the court must keep in mind all these relevant\r\nfactors while appreciating evidence of a rustic witness.\u201D\r\n34. It can thus be seen that this Court has held that in case of rustic witnesses, some inconsistencies\r\nand discrepancies are bound to be found. It has been held that the inconsistencies in the evidence of\r\nthe witnesses should not be blown out of proportion. To do so is to ignore hard realities of village life\r\nand give undeserved benefit to the accused. It has been held that the evidence of such witnesses has\r\nto be appreciated as a whole. A rustic witness is not expected to remember every small detail of the\r\nincident and the manner in which the incident had happened. Further, a witness is bound to face\r\nshock of the untimely death of his near relatives. Upon perusal of the evidence of the witnesses as a\r\nwhole, we are of the considered view that their evidence is cogent, reliable and trustworthy.\r\n35. Having held that the ocular testimony of the witnesses establishes the guilt of the accused\r\nbeyond reasonable doubt, we come to the other contentions of the appellant. Insofar as the\r\ncontention of the appellant that the medical evidence does not support the prosecution case, it will\r\nbe appropriate to rely on the judgment of this Court in the case of Krishnan and Another (supra):\u2212\r\n\u201C18. The evidence of Dr Muthuswami (PW 7) and Dr Abbas Ali (PW 8) do not in any way run\r\ncontrary to the ocular evidence. In any event, the ocular evidence being cogent, credible and\r\ntrustworthy, minor variance, if any, with the medical evidence is not of any consequence.\r\n20. Coming to the plea that the medical evidence is at variance with ocular evidence, it has to be\r\nnoted that it would be erroneous to accord undue primacy to the hypothetical answers of medical\r\nwitnesses to exclude the eyewitnesses' account which had to be tested independently and not treated\r\nas the \u201Cvariable\u201D keeping the medical evidence as the \u201Cconstant\u201D.\r\n21. It is trite that where the eyewitnesses' account is found credible and trustworthy, medical\r\nopinion pointing to alternative possibilities is not accepted as conclusive. Witnesses, as Bentham\r\nsaid, are the eyes and ears of justice. Hence the importance and primacy of the quality of the trial\r\nprocess. Eyewitnesses' account would require a careful independent assessment and evaluation for\r\nits credibility which should not be adversely prejudged making any other evidence, including\r\nmedical evidence, as the sole touchstone for the test of such credibility. The evidence must be tested\r\nfor its inherent consistency and the inherent probability of the story; consistency with the account of\r\nother witnesses held to be creditworthy; consistency with the undisputed facts, the \u201Ccredit\u201D of the\r\nwitnesses; their performance in the witness box; their power of observation etc. Then the probative\r\nvalue of such evidence becomes eligible to be put into the scales for a cumulative evaluation.\u201D\r\n36. As already discussed hereinabove, the ocular evidence of the eye witnesses is cogent, reliable and\r\ntrustworthy. Apart from that, the oral version in the testimonies of PWs 1, 2 and 3 is duly\r\ncorroborated by the injuries as shown in the Post\u2212Mortem Report of the deceased persons.\r\nTherefore, the contention in this regard is liable to be rejected.\r\n37. The attack of the appellant is on the other circumstances like the recovery of the axe under\r\nSection 27 of the Evidence Act not being relevant, since the same not being established to be used in\r\nthe offence nor in the Serology Report, etc.\r\n38. Since the present case is a case of direct evidence, even if the prosecution has failed to prove the\r\nother incriminating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt, in our view, it will not have an effect\r\non the prosecution case. In the present case, another factor that is to be noted is that immediately\r\nafter the incident, FIR is lodged by PW\u22121 who was accompanied by PW\u22124. The FIR fully\r\ncorroborates the ocular evidence of prosecution witnesses.\r\n39. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered view that even upon reappreciation of the\r\nevidence, it cannot be said that the trial court has committed an error in convicting the appellant\r\nand the High Court in confirming the same.\r\n40. That leaves us with the question of sentence. We will have to consider as to whether the capital\r\npunishment in the present case is warranted or not.\r\n41. Recently, this Court in the case of Mohd. Mannan alias Abdul Mannan v. State of Bihar10, after\r\nconsidering earlier judgments of this Court on the present issue in the cases of Bachan Singh v. State\r\nof Punjab11 and Machhi Singh and Others v. State of Punjab12, observed thus:\u2212 \u201C72. The\r\nproposition of law which emerges from the judgments referred to above is itself death sentence\r\ncannot be imposed except in the rarest of rare cases, for which special reasons have to be recorded,\r\nas mandated in Section 354(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code. In deciding whether a case falls\r\nwithin the category of the rarest of rare, 10 (2019) 16 SCC 584 11 (1980) 2 SCC 684 12 (1983) 3 SCC\r\n470 the brutality, and\/or the gruesome and\/or heinous nature of the crime is not the sole criterion.\r\nIt is not just the crime which the Court is to take into consideration, but also the criminal, the state\r\nof his mind, his socio\u2212 economic background, etc. Awarding death sentence is an exception, and life\r\nimprisonment is the rule.\u201D\r\n42. This Bench, recently, in the case of Mofil Khan and Another v. The State of Jharkhand13 has\r\nobserved thus:\u2212 \u201C8. One of the mitigating circumstances is the probability of the accused being\r\nreformed and rehabilitated. The State is under a duty to procure evidence to establish that there is\r\nno possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the accused. Death sentence ought not to be\r\nimposed, save in the rarest of the rare cases when the alternative option of a lesser punishment is\r\nunquestionably foreclosed (See: Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980) 2 SCC\r\n684). To satisfy that the sentencing aim of reformation is unachievable, rendering life imprisonment\r\ncompletely futile, the Court will have to highlight clear evidence as to why the convict is not fit for\r\nany kind of reformatory and rehabilitation scheme. This analysis can only be done with rigour when\r\nthe Court focuses on the circumstances relating to the criminal, along with other circumstances\r\n(See: Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra (2009) 6 SCC 498). In\r\nRajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra (2019) 12 SCC 460, this Court dealt with the\r\nreview of a 13 RP(Criminal) No. 641\/2015 in Criminal Appeal No.1795\/2009 dated 26.11.2021\r\njudgment of this Court confirming death sentence and observed as under:\r\n\u201C45. The law laid down by various decisions of this Court clearly and unequivocally\r\nmandates that the probability (not possibility or improbability or impossibility) that a\r\nconvict can be reformed and rehabilitated in society must be seriously and earnestly\r\nconsidered by the courts before awarding the death sentence. This is one of the\r\nmandates of the \u201Cspecial reasons\u201D requirement of Section 354(3) CrPC and ought not\r\nto be taken lightly since it involves snuffing out the life of a person. To effectuate this\r\nmandate, it is the obligation on the prosecution to prove to the court, through\r\nevidence, that the probability is that the convict cannot be reformed or rehabilitated.\r\nThis can be achieved by bringing on record, inter alia, material about his conduct in\r\njail, his conduct outside jail if he has been on bail for some time, medical evidence\r\nabout his mental make\u2212up, contact with his family and so on.\r\nSimilarly, the convict can produce evidence on these issues as well.\u201D\u201D\r\n43. In the present case, it is to be noted that the trial court had convicted the\r\nappellant and imposed death penalty on the very same day. From the judgment of the\r\ntrial court, it does not appear that the appellant was given a meaningful time and a\r\nreal opportunity of hearing on the question of sentence. From the judgment of the\r\ntrial court as well as the High Court, it does not appear that the courts below have\r\ndrawn a balance sheet of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The trial court as\r\nwell as the High Court has only taken into consideration the crime but have not taken\r\ninto consideration the criminal, his state of mind, his socio\u2212 economic background\r\netc. At this juncture, it will be relevant to refer to the following observations of this\r\nCourt in the case of Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra14:\u2212 \u201C47.\r\nConsideration of the reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration of the convict into\r\nsociety cannot be overemphasised. Until Bachan Singh [Bachan Singh v. State of\r\nPunjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580] , the emphasis given by the courts\r\nwas primarily on the nature of the crime, its brutality and severity. Bachan Singh\r\n[Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580] placed the\r\nsentencing process into perspective and introduced the necessity of considering the\r\nreformation or rehabilitation of the convict.\r\nDespite the view expressed by the Constitution Bench, there have been several instances, some of\r\nwhich have been pointed out in Bariyar [Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of\r\nMaharashtra, (2009) 6 SCC 498 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 1150] and 14 (2019) 12 SCC 460 in Sangeet v.\r\nState of Haryana [Sangeet v. State of Haryana, (2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 611] where\r\nthere is a tendency to give primacy to the crime and consider the criminal in a somewhat secondary\r\nmanner. As observed in Sangeet [Sangeet v. State of Haryana, (2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri)\r\n611] \u201CIn the sentencing process, both the crime and the criminal are equally important.\u201D Therefore,\r\nwe should not forget that the criminal, however ruthless he might be, is nevertheless a human being\r\nand is entitled to a life of dignity notwithstanding his crime. Therefore, it is for the prosecution and\r\nthe courts to determine whether such a person, notwithstanding his crime, can be reformed and\r\nrehabilitated. To obtain and analyse this information is certainly not an easy task but must\r\nnevertheless be undertaken. The process of rehabilitation is also not a simple one since it involves\r\nsocial reintegration of the convict into society. Of course, notwithstanding any information made\r\navailable and its analysis by experts coupled with the evidence on record, there could be instances\r\nwhere the social reintegration of the convict may not be possible. If that should happen, the option\r\nof a long duration of imprisonment is permissible.\u201D\r\n44. In view of the settled legal position, it is our bounden duty to take into consideration the\r\nprobability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated. It is also our duty to take into\r\nconsideration not only the crime but also the criminal, his state of mind and his socio\u2212economic\r\nconditions. The deceased as well as the appellant are rustic villagers. In a property dispute, the\r\nappellant has got done away with two of his siblings and a nephew. The State has not placed on\r\nrecord any evidence to show that there is no possibility with respect to reformation or rehabilitation\r\nof the convict. The appellant has placed on record the affidavits of Prahalad Patel, son of appellant\r\nand Rajendra Patel, nephew of appellant and also the report of the Jail Superintendent, Central Jail,\r\nJabalpur. The appellant comes from a rural and economically poor background. There are no\r\ncriminal antecedents. The appellant cannot be said to be a hardened criminal. This is the first\r\noffence committed by the appellant, no doubt, a heinous one. The certificate issued by the Jail\r\nSuperintendent shows that the conduct of the appellant during incarceration has been satisfactory.\r\nIt cannot therefore be said that there is no possibility of the appellant being reformed and\r\nrehabilitated foreclosing the alternative option of a lesser sentence and making imposition of death\r\nsentence imperative.\r\n45. We are therefore inclined to convert the sentence imposed on the appellant from death to life.\r\nHowever, taking into consideration the gruesome murder of two of his siblings and one nephew, we\r\nare of the view that the appellant deserves rigorous imprisonment of 30 years.\r\n46. Accordingly, the appeals are partly allowed. The conviction of the appellant for the offences\r\npunishable under Sections 302, 201 and 506\u2212B of the IPC is affirmed. However, the death sentence\r\nawarded to the appellant is converted to life imprisonment for a period of 30 years.\r\n47. Before we part with the judgment, we must appreciate the valuable assistance rendered by Shri\r\nN. Hariharan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and Smt. Swarupama\r\nChaturvedi, learned Assistant Advocate General appearing on behalf of the respondent\u2212 State.\r\n\u2026\u2026....\u2026.......................J. [L.

          "judgement":"Rastogi, J.\r\n1. Leave granted.\r\n2. The instant appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 10th June, 2021 passed by\r\nthe High Court of Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 136 of 1996 upholding conviction for the offence\r\npunishable under Section 326 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 5 years with\r\na fine of Rs. 10,000\/\u2212 and under Section 357 of Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC) of Rupees Two\r\nLakhs as a monetary compensation to the victim.\r\n3. The prosecution case is that on 13th December 1993, at around 5.30 p.m., Subhash Yadavrao\r\nPatil(injured victim) was returning to Malegaon from Tembhurni on bicycle. While he was near to\r\nthe main road, the accused persons arrived there in the tractor and they started pelting stone at him.\r\nThe stone hit his back and one of the accused gave a blow of Satur on his leg below the left knee.\r\nWhile he started running, he fell down and the present accused appellant gave blow by lethal\r\nweapon(sword) on his right leg below the knee and due to the brutal blow, it was almost mutilated\r\nand while trying to avoid the blow of sickle, the injured tried to avoid by raising his right hand and\r\nthe blow hit his right arm below the elbow due to which it was detached and there was profuse\r\nbleeding from the injuries and he was immediately taken to the hospital for medical assistance.\r\n4. Dr. Vijay Shivram Upase(PW 8) who examined the victim deposed that when the patient was\r\nbrought to the hospital, his lower right leg below knee was completely detached and severed and\r\nright arm below the elbow was hanging by the skin. He had bandaged the injuries only to stop\r\nbleeding and cover the wounds. That all the vessels of the veins were open and arteries of injury no.\r\n1 and 4 were cut. There was profuse bleeding and without immediate medical intervention, the\r\ncumulative effect of all the injuries suffered by the victim would have resulted into death. Injury nos.\r\n1 and 4 were dangerous to life.\r\n5. The injuries were not only brutal but the injured was left in such a critical condition that upon\r\nseeing him, PW 22 had immediately arranged for recording his dying declaration by Dr. Pawale(PW\r\n12) Special Executive Magistrate. PW 22 further stated that it would be only the strong will of the\r\nvictim and with the immediate medical care that he could survive. The medical certificate\u2212Ex.59\r\nissued by the Primary Health Centre, Tembhurni, shows the injuries as follows:\u2212 \u201Ci. Sharp\r\namputated curt over right lower leg 1\/3rd. It was completely cut.\r\nii. Incised wound over \u00BD above injury no.1 front part, size 4 \u00BD\u201D x \u00BD\u201D.\r\niii. Incised wound \u00BD % above injury No.1 outer side, 1\u201Dx \u00BC\u201D. iv. Sharp amputated cut over 1\u201D below\r\nright fore arm, middle part, arm completely cut.\r\nv. Incised abrasion left side back of ear \u00BC\u201D x \u00BC\u201D.\r\n6. Initially, 12 accused persons faced the trial and were convicted by the learned trial Judge for\r\noffence punishable under Section 326 read with Section 149 IPC for causing grievous hurt to\r\nSubhash Yadavrao Patil(PW\u22127) and each of them was sentenced to suffer 7 years R.I. and fine in\r\nsum of Rs. 1000\/\u2212 each, in default, to suffer R.I. for the period of six months by judgment dated 26\r\nth February, 1996. On appeal being preferred collectively by all the 12 accused persons, the High\r\nCourt under its impugned judgment dated 10 th June, 2021 found the accused A3, A4, A10 and A12\r\nincluding the present appellant(A1) guilty and because of lack of material against the other accused\r\npersons, they were acquitted under the impugned judgment. The appeal stood abated in respect of\r\nfour accused persons, A3, A4, A10 and A12.\r\n7. The submission made before the High Court by learned counsel for the appellant was that the\r\nincident is of the year 1993 and the appellant was on bail during trial and also pending appeal before\r\nthe High Court and to revert back to suffer substantive sentence after 28 years would be unjustified\r\nbut his contention was repelled after assigning reasons in the impugned judgment:\u2212 \u201C30. It was the\r\nspecific submission by the respective counsel appearing for the appellants that the incidence is of\r\nthe year 1993 and that the appellants are on bail since 1996 and that, to revert them back to suffer\r\nsubstantive sentence would be unjustified after 23 years. However, the court cannot be oblivious of\r\nthe fact that the complainant has survived in the hope of justice with a prosthetic arm and leg for all\r\nthese years and his hand and leg had to be amputated.\r\n35. The victim has been crippled for life. It is true that he is pursuing his daily chores with a\r\nprosthetic arm and leg but he has lost his vital organs of his body. The doctors who had examined\r\nPW7 have clearly stated that in the absence of immediate treatment, the death was certain. There is\r\nno reason to doubt the testimony of the victim which is duly corroborated by the PW8.\u201D\r\n8. This was the primary reason for which while upholding conviction under Section 326 IPC, the\r\nappellant is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and to pay under Section 357 CrPC of\r\nRs. 2 lakhs as a monetary compensation to the victim.\r\n9. The application for exemption from surrendering was rejected by the learned Chamber Judge by\r\nan Order dated 14 th July, 2021. Only thereafter, the appellant has surrendered on 5 th August 2021.\r\nIt is informed to this Court that he has undergone the actual sentence by this time of 5 months.\r\n10. The record indicates that no notice was issued by this Court and when the matter was listed for\r\nadmission, Mr. Mahesh Jethmalani, learned senior counsel for the appellant has not argued on\r\nmerits and confined his submission for compounding the sentence for the reason that a compromise\r\nhas been entered between the appellant and the injured victim and in support thereof, a\r\ncompromise affidavit of the victim dated 13 th July, 2021 has been placed on record to justify that\r\nthe victim has no desire to make the appellant undergo the remaining sentence and keeping in view\r\nthe peace and harmony between the families, it has been requested by the complainant victim to\r\ncompound the offence and submits that the appellant be released on the sentence undergone.\r\n11. Learned senior counsel on the strength of the compromise affidavit placed on record submits\r\nthat when the parties have settled their disputes amicably and the relations of the families are very\r\ncordial and they are now closely related having matrimonial relations with each other\u2019s family and\r\nthe incident has occurred due to misunderstanding and on the spur of the moment and submitted\r\nthat the parties have jointly prayed, in the interest of peace and harmony between both the families\r\nand as requested by the complainant to compound the offence and in the interest of justice, he may\r\nbe released on the sentence undergone and has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in\r\nRam Pujan and Others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh1 and Murali Vs. State represented by Inspector of\r\nPolice2.\r\n12. Learned counsel for the complainant has joined hands with the appellant and submits that a\r\njoint affidavit has been filed by the injured complainant(PW\u22127) and he has been instructed to\r\ninform this Court that in terms of Para 3 of the affidavit of the injured victim, the parties have\r\nrestored their cordial relations and also prays that the appellant be released on the period of\r\nsentence undergone.\r\n13. Per contra, Mr. Sachin Patil, learned counsel for the State opposed the request made by the\r\nappellant and submits that the ultimate object of the criminal justice system is to protect the society\r\nand to deter the criminal in achieving the avowed object of law by imposing appropriate sentence. It\r\nis always expected that the courts would operate the sentencing system so as to impose such\r\nsentence which reflects the conscience of the society and the sentencing 1 1973(2) SCC 456 2 2021(1)\r\nSCC 726 process has to be stern where it should be and proceeding on such premise, of alleged\r\ncompromise obtained after the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 10th June, 2021\r\nupholding conviction under Section 326 IPC and sentenced to undergo 5 years of rigorous sentence,\r\nsuch compromise after 28 years of the incident, according to him, is obtained by coercion or\r\ninducement not only to harm the criminal justice system but it undermines the public confidence of\r\nthe efficacy of law and society.\r\n14. Learned counsel further submits that the learned trial Judge and also the High Court, while\r\nimposing sentence, has taken note of the nature of the incident, their related factors in which the\r\ncrime has been committed and has delicately balanced the relevant circumstances in a dispassionate\r\nmanner which ordinarily is not to be interfered because of the alleged compromise being obtained\r\nand cordial relations overnight are developed after 28 years of the incident.\r\n15. Learned counsel further submits that the incident is of 13 th December 1993, the learned trial\r\nJudge convicted the accused by its judgment dated 26th February, 1996 and appeal was preferred\r\nbefore the High Court at the instance of the appellant in the year 1996 which came to be decided in\r\nJune, 2021, and the appellant was on bail throughout, cordial relations between the families never\r\ncame forward but only after conviction has been upheld and the appellant now has to undergo\r\nsentence, such compromise affidavit has been placed on record to justify in avoiding sentence which\r\nordinarily attaches no credence and submits that the compromise affidavits which are being filed, its\r\nbonafide and genuineness is to be recorded in the facts of each case and submits that looking to the\r\ninjury of permanent disability which the complainant has suffered, the present appellant despite a\r\nshield of compromise on record deserves no indulgence.\r\n16. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties\r\nand with their assistance perused the material available on record.\r\n17. It is not in dispute that the offence punishable under Section 326 IPC is non\u2212compoundable as\r\nper Section 320 CrPC. The case of the prosecution is that the appellant attacked the injured\r\nvictim(PW\u2212\r\n7) with a lethal weapon(sword) which had caused permanent nature of disability and the brutality is\r\napparent on the face of record. His right arm and leg were chopped off during the course of crime\r\nwhich occurred on 13th December, 1993. It was only because of the strong will and immediate\r\nmedical treatment extended to the victim that he could survive. It was even stated by the treating\r\nDoctor that in the absence of immediate medical treatment, his death was certain.\r\n18. After going through the record of the case and the concurrent finding of fact which has been\r\nrecorded by the learned trial Judge and confirmed by the High Court in the impugned judgment,\r\nalthough no submissions have been made by the learned counsel for the appellant on merits of the\r\nmatter but still for our own satisfaction, we have gone through the record and in our considered\r\nview, the appellant has been rightly held guilty and convicted for offence under Section 326 IPC.\r\n19. Learned counsel for the appellant has restricted his submission only for sentencing taking\r\ndefence of the compromise dated 13 th July, 2021 entered into between the parties but the fact is\r\nthat after he has been convicted under Section 326 IPC and sentenced to 5 years rigorous\r\nimprisonment under the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 10th June 2021, all such\r\nfamily relations came on the ground and he has hardly undergone 5 months of sentence as on the\r\ndate as informed to this Court.\r\n20. This Court considers it appropriate to extract para 3 of the compromise affidavit filed by the\r\nvictim dated 13 th July, 2021 as follows:\u2212 \u201C3. That the deponent further submits that the incident in\r\nquestion took place on 13\/12\/1993 i.e., almost before 28 years due to misunderstanding and in the\r\nspur of moment. The petitioner and the deponent to the same clan and they all have in same Village\r\nand with passage of time, the relations between the petitioner and the deponent have become very\r\ncordial. The petitioner and the deponent are now very closely related and are having matrimonial\r\nrelations with each other family. The petitioner\u2019s and deponent\u2019s families participate in the\r\nfunctions of each other\u2019s. With the huge time gap, the grudges amongst each other have vanished\r\naway and have taken a shape of friendship. The petitioner is 65 year old person suffering from heart\r\ndisease and requires medical help and attention regularly. They have old age parents wife and\r\nchildren to look after, their entire family would suffer irreparable loss if the petitioner go behind the\r\nbars at this stage. The petitioner has suffered imprisonment at the time of trial as well as after\r\nconviction till the time bail was granted to him by the trial court and high court. The deponent does\r\nnot have a slightest desire to make the petitioner undergo the remaining sentence. Therefore, in the\r\ninterest of both the parties and so also in the interest of the peace and harmony between both the\r\nfamilies, the complainant has filed this affidavit permission to compound the offence.\u201D\r\n21. The three\u2212Judge Bench of this Court in Ram Pujan and Others(supra) and Murli(supra) has\r\nrecorded its satisfaction that the compromise has not been obtained out of coercion and inducement\r\nand entered with free will without any reservation\/caveat certainly be acted upon and can be one of\r\nthe mitigating factor to be considered by altering the sentence in question.\r\n22. We are in full agreement on legal principles and on facts which has been noticed by this Court in\r\nthe judgment referred to supra. But we are not being able to record our satisfaction on the contents\r\nof the compromise which has been obtained overnight after conviction under Section 326 IPC being\r\nconfirmed by the High Court under the impugned judgment for the incident of December 1993.\r\n23. The substance of what has been referred to in paragraph 3 of the compromise and noticed by us,\r\nthe statement of fact is completely superfluous in the mechanical form and nothing elicit about the\r\nearlier relations, if any, or when such cordial relations or what kind of family relations later on have\r\nbeen developed, all such facts are completely missing and the contents are stereotyped, appears to\r\nbe copied from paragraph 6 of the judgment in Mohd. Ibrahim Vs. State of Karnataka and\r\nOthers(Criminal Appeal No. 825 of 2018) decided by this Court on 5th July, 2018.\r\n24. In the recent judgment in Murali (supra), this Court has taken into consideration not only the\r\ncompromise but the other aggravating and mitigating circumstances in which the crime has been\r\ncommitted including the fact that the accused has undergone more than half the sentence and in\r\ntotality of the facts and circumstances, this Court has interfered and molded the sentence\r\n25. In the facts and circumstances of the given case, for deciding just and appropriate sentence to be\r\nawarded for an offence, the aggravating and mitigating factors and circumstances of which the crime\r\nhas been committed are to be taken into consideration and to be delicately balanced on the basis of\r\nthe relevant circumstances in a dispassionate manner by the Court.\r\n26. While disposing of the appeal preferred at the instance of the present appellant, the High Court\r\nhas recorded its sufficient reasons while convicting him under Section 326 IPC and not only the fact\r\nthat it was a pre\u2212meditated attempt of the appellant, he assaulted the victim with the sword and\r\nchopped of his right leg below the knee and right forearm below the elbow and the brutality is\r\napparent on the face of record.\r\n27. This Court cannot be oblivious of this fact that the injured victim has been crippled for life and\r\npursuing his daily chores with the prosthetic arm and leg and has lost vital organs of the body and\r\nbecame permanently disabled. This has been stated by PW 8 that in the absence of immediate\r\nmedical attention, death was certain and that was the reason his dying declaration was also recorded\r\nduring that point of time, in our considered view, such a brutality cannot be ignored which is not\r\nagainst the individual but the crime is against the society which has to be dealt with sternly.\r\n28. Giving punishment to the wrongdoer is the heart of the criminal delivery system, but we do not\r\nfind any legislative or judicially laid down guidelines to assess the trial Court in meeting out the just\r\npunishment to the accused facing trial before it after he is held guilty of the charges. Nonetheless, if\r\none goes through the decisions of this Court, it would appear that this Court takes into account a\r\ncombination of different factors while exercising discretion in sentencing, that is proportionality,\r\ndeterrence, rehabilitation, etc.\r\n29. The compromise if entered at the later stage of the incident or even after conviction can indeed\r\nbe one of the factor in interfering the sentence awarded to commensurate with the nature of offence\r\nbeing committed to avoid bitterness in the families of the accused and the victim and it will always\r\nbe better to restore their relation, if possible, but the compromise cannot be taken to be a solitary\r\nbasis until the other aggravating and mitigating factors also support and are favourable to the\r\naccused for molding the sentence which always has to be examined in the facts and circumstances of\r\nthe case on hand.\r\n30. As already observed, we have not be able to record our satisfaction in reference to the kind of\r\ncompromise which has now been obtained and placed on record after 28 years of the incident and\r\nthis Court cannot be oblivious of the sufferings which the victim has suffered for such a long time\r\nand being crippled for life and the leg and arm of the victim are amputated in the alleged incident\r\ndated 13th December, 1993 and since then he has been fighting for life and is pursuing his daily\r\nchores with a prosthetic arm and leg and has lost his vital organs of his body and became\r\npermanently disabled and such act of the appellant is unpardonable.\r\n31. In totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, we are not inclined to give any benefit of the\r\nalleged compromise dated 13 th July, 2021 for interfering in the sentence awarded by the High\r\nCourt in the impugned judgment which at least does not call for interference of this Court.\r\n32. As a result, the appeal is dismissed accordingly.\r\n33. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

The Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No.\r\n5703 OF 2021 reasons that weighed with the said Court for granting bail to A-4 were that :-\r\n(i) he was not found to be in possession of any psychotropic substance and no\r\ncontraband was recovered from his residence or office during the search;\r\n(ii) the electronic gagets\/devices that were seized from the office of A-4 had been sent\r\nfor obtaining a scientific report which was still awaited;\r\n(iii) while 1,37,665 tablets were seized from four different locations in Chennai\r\nbetween 15th October, 2019 and 18th October, 2019, officers of the DRI had gone to\r\nJaipur to arrest A-4 after five months, solely on the basis of the statement made by\r\nA-1 under Section 67 of the NDPS Act;\r\n(iv) there was no live link established against A-4, a resident of Jaipur of having\r\nconnived with the other accused, A-1 to A-3 who were all residing in Chennai and\r\narrested from there.\r\n(v) the test reports in respect of the seized material were awaited and it was not\r\nestablished whether the tablets which, as per the accused were sexual enhancement\r\ntablets, would qualify either as a narcotic or psychotrophic substance so as to fall\r\nwithin the ambit of the NDPS Act;\r\nPetition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 5703 OF 2021\r\n(vi) The first test report received by the DRI on 21 st November, 2019, revealed that the tablets were\r\nactually sexual enhancement drugs and not covered under the NDPS Act and the test report in\r\nrespect of 26 tablets sent to CFSL, Hyderabad, was still awaited.\r\n5. Being mindful of the recent verdict of a Three Judge Bench of this Court in Tofan Singh v. State of\r\nMadras 3 wherein as per the majority decision, a confessional statement recorded under Section 67\r\nof the NDPS Act has been held to be inadmissible in the trial of an offence under the NDPS Act, the\r\nlearned Special Judge, EC & NDPS Cases, Chennai granted bail to Bharat Chaudhary [A-4]. On the\r\nDRI challenging the aforesaid order before the High Court of Madras, the bail order granted in\r\nfavour of A-4 has been cancelled by the learned Single Judge with scathing remarks made against\r\nthe learned Special Judge. Citing the same reasons as have been given in the case of A4, the bail\r\napplication moved by A1 has also been rejected.\r\n6. The learned Single Judge has faulted the Special Judge, EC & NDPS Cases] for having conducted\r\na roving enquiry to grant bail to A-4. It has been held that the ruling in Tofan Singh\u2019s case, does not\r\nbar the Prosecuting Agency from recording the statement of the co-accused for the purpose of\r\napprehending the other accused in the offence. Observing that 3 [2021] 4 SCC 1 Petition for Special\r\nLeave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 5703 OF 2021 it was not on the basis of the statement of A-4 that he\r\nhas been arrested and detained, but rather on the basis of the information furnished by A-1 to A-3\r\nwho have implicated him as a person involved in the offence and for arranging supply of\r\ncontraband, it was held that absence of any evidence to establish a link between A-1, A-3 and A-4\r\ncould not form the basis for granting any relief to A-4. As for the observation of the Special Judge,\r\nEC & NDPS Cases that the test reports received by the prosecuting agency on 22nd November, 2019\r\nrevealed that many of the tablets were sexual enhancement drugs and not covered under the NDPS\r\nAct, the High Court opined that the test reports did not totally negate the fact that the seized\r\ncontraband goods were not narcotic substances. Much emphasis was laid on the total quantity of the\r\ncontraband seized and it was held that once the test reports showed that some of the tablets\r\ncontained narcotic substances, it was sufficient to refuse bail to A-4. Critical of the approach of the\r\ntrial Court that held that since the test reports were not filed by the prosecuting agency along with\r\nthe complaint, the benefit ought to enure in favour of A- 4, the High Court observed that, by thetime the Special Judge, EC & NDPS Cases had pronounced the order on 2 nd November, 2020, test\r\nreports were available and ought to have been taken into consideration.\r\n7. Appearing for Bharat Chaudhary [A-4], Mr. Gopal Shankaranarayanan, learned Senior Advocate\r\nhas assailed the impugned Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 5703 OF 2021 order\r\ncontending that there was no good reason for the High Court to have cancelled the bail granted to\r\nA-4 by the learned Special Judge, EC & NDPS cases. He submitted that a grave error has been\r\ncommitted by the High Court by completely overlooking the fact that not a single tablet was\r\nrecovered from the possession of A-4; that the tablets were seized from the premises of A-1 to A-3\r\nand some of the extracted samples sent for testing showed that a large number of the seized pills\r\nwere sex enhancement drugs and not contraband; that the seized contraband had not been\r\nproduced or sampled before the Magistrate and that A4 has been dragged into the matter solely on\r\nthe basis of the confession\/statements made by Raja Chandrasekaran [A-1] under Section 67 of the\r\nNDPS Act, despite the fact that in a recent judgment of this Court in Tofan Singh (supra), the\r\nmajority view is that a confessional statement is not admissible in evidence which view has been\r\nfollowed in Criminal Appeal No. 1273 of 2021 titled \u201CSanjeev Chandra Agarwal vs. Union of India\u201D,\r\ndecided on 25th October, 2021.\r\n8. Mr. Anand Grover, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of Raja Chandrasekharan [A-1]\r\nhas argued that the High Court has fallen into an error by rejecting the bail application of A-1\r\nwithout considering the submission made that no commercial quantity of the psychotropic\r\nsubstance had been proved so far. The test reports produced by the Petition for Special Leave to\r\nAppeal (Criminal) No. 5703 OF 2021 prosecution showed that the Ayurvedic\/herbal medicines\r\nseized were meant for sex enhancement which do not fall under the ambit of the NDPS Act and that\r\nStanding Order 1\/89 issued by the Government of India under Section 52A of the NDPS Act has\r\nbeen completely disregarded inasmuch as the samples were not drawn on the spot and\/or recovered\r\nfrom the premises of A-1, nor were the samples drawn in the office of DRI in the presence of the\r\naccused and the Panchas. It was canvassed that the sanctity and integrity of the seizure made is\r\nhighly doubtful on account of failure on the part of the prosecuting agency to follow the procedure\r\nprescribed in Sections 42 and 52 of the NDPS Act. It was also argued that the information received\r\nand recorded in the present case, was in respect of the alleged export of the psychotropic substances\r\nfrom the premises of M\/s Aviation Star Express, a franchisee of M\/s. DHL Express Limited and\r\nthere is no mention of A-1 or his premises in the information referred to under Section 42 of the\r\nNDPS Act.\r\n9. Per contra, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for DRI has\r\nsupported the impugned judgment and vehemently argued that A-4 is the mastermind behind the\r\nentire criminal conspiracy and he, in connivance with A-1, has been supplying contraband to A-1 to\r\nA- 3, for being illegally exported abroad under the garb of sex enhancement tablets. She alluded to\r\nthe 71 samples sent for testing and the test report Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal)\r\nNo. 5703 OF 2021 of CRCL, Chennai dated 18th December, 2019 confirming the presence of\r\nnarcotic substances along with male potency increment drugs and strenuously argued that the nexus\r\nbetween A-4 and A-1 to A-3 is not only established through the statements of A-1 to A-3 recorded\r\nunder Section 67 of the NDPS Act, but also from the documents in the form of printouts of the data\r\nBharat Chaudhary vs Union Of India on 13 December, 2021\r\ndownloaded from the moblie phone and laptop of A-4, in particular, the Whatsapp chats and bank\r\ntransactions between A-1 and A-4. Submitting that since the twin tests laid down under Section 37\r\nof the NDPS Act in respect of commercial quantity for grant of bail have not been satisfied, the\r\nimpugned order does not deserve interference.\r\n10. After carefully examining the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and having\r\ncursorily glanced at the records, we are of the opinion that the impugned order cancelling the bail\r\ngranted in favour of Bharat Chaudhary [A-4], is not sustanabile in view of the fact that the records\r\nsought to be relied upon by the prosecution show that one test report dated 6th December, 2019,\r\ntwo test reports dated 17 th December, 2019 and one test report dated 21 st December, 2019 in\r\nrespect of the sample pills\/tablets drawn and sent for testing by the prosecuting agency conclude\r\nwith a note appended by the Assistant Commercial Examiner at the foot of the reports stating that\r\n\u201Cquantitative analysis of the samples could not be carried out for want of facilities\u201D. In the absence of\r\nany clarity Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 5703 OF 2021 so far on the\r\nquantitative analysis of the samples, the prosecution cannot be heard to state at this preliminary\r\nstage that the petitioners have been found to be in possession of commercial quantity of\r\npsychotropic subtances as contemplated under the NDPS Act. Further, a large number of the tablets\r\nthat have been seized by the DRI admittedly contain herbs\/medicines meant to enhance male\r\npotency and they do not attract the provisions of the NDPS Act. Most importantly, none of the\r\ntablets were seized by the prosecution during the course of the search conducted, either at the office\r\nor at the residence of A-4 at Jaipur, on 16 th March, 2020. Reliance on printouts of Whatsapp\r\nmessages downloaded from the mobile phone and devices seized from the office premises of A-4\r\ncannot be treated at this stage as sufficient material to establish a live link between him and A-1 to\r\nA-3, when even as per the prosecution, scientific reports in respect of the said devices is still\r\nawaited.\r\n11. In the absence of any psychotropic substance found in the conscious possession of A-4, we are of\r\nthe opinion that mere reliance on the statement made by A-1 to A-3 under Section 67 of the NDPS\r\nAct is too tenuous a ground to sustain the impugned order dated 15 th July, 2021. This is all the\r\nmore so when such a reliance runs contrary to the ruling in Tofan Singh (supra). The impugned\r\norder qua A-4 is, accordingly, quashed and set aside and the order dated 2nd November, 2020\r\npassed by the learned Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 5703 OF 2021 Special\r\nJudge, EC & NDPS Cases, is restored. As for Raja Chandrasekharan [A-1], since the charge sheet has\r\nalready been filed and by now the said accused has remained in custody for over a period of two\r\nyears, it is deemed appropriate to release him on bail, subject to the satisfaction of the trial Court.\r\n12. Before parting with the cases, it is clarified that the prima facie observations made hereinabove\r\nare limited to considering the relief of regular bail prayed for by the petitioners and nothing\r\nexpressed hereinabove shall be treated as an observation on the merits of the case, i.e., CC\r\nNo.0000037\/2020, pending trial. The petitions for special leave to appeal are disposed of in the\r\nabove terms.",

          "judgement":"N.V. RAMANA, J.\r\n1. This Civil Appeal raises an important question of law concerning arbitration law in India and\r\nspecial enactments enacted by States concerning public works contract.\r\n2. A brief reference to facts in this case is necessary for the disposal of the case. On 13.02.1991,\r\nRespondent No. 1 entered into a contract with the Appellant to manufacture and supply bricks. The\r\naforesaid contract had an arbitration clause. As some dispute arose regarding payment in\r\nfurtherance of Date: 2021.01.06 15:59:16 IST Reason:\r\nmanufacturing and supplying of bricks, the Appellant issued a notice dated\r\n13.11.1998, seeking appointment of sole arbitrator in terms of the agreement. Clause\r\n38 of the agreement provide for arbitration as under:\r\nClause 38 \u2013 Arbitration All disputes or differences in respect of which the decision\r\nhas not been settled, shall be referred for arbitration to a sole arbitrator appointed as\r\nfollows:\r\nWithin thirty days of receipt of notice from the Contractor of his intention to refer the\r\ndispute to arbitration the Chief Engineer shall send to the Contractor a list of three\r\nofficers from the list of arbitrator appointment by the Government. The Contractor\r\nshall within fifteen days of receipt of this list select and communicate to the Chief\r\nEngineer the name of the person from the list who shall then be appointed as the sole\r\narbitrator. If Contractor fails to communicate his selection of name, within the\r\nstipulated period, the Chief Engineer, shall without delay select one officer from the\r\nlist and appoint him as the sole arbitrator. If the Chief Engineer fails to send such a\r\nlist within thirty days, as stipulated, the contractor shall send a similar list to the\r\nChief Engineer within fifteen days. The Chief Engineer shall then select one officer\r\nform the list and appoint him as the sole arbitrator within fifteen days. If the Chief\r\nEngineer fails to do so the contractor shall communicate to the Chief Engineer the\r\nname of one Officer from the list, who shall then be the sole arbitrator.\r\nThe arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provision of the Indian\r\nArbitration Act, 1940 or any statutory modification thereof. The decision of the sole\r\narbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties thereto. The Arbitrator shall\r\ndetermine the amount of costs of arbitration to be awarded to either parties.\r\nPerformance under the contract shall continue during the arbitration proceedings\r\nand payments due to the contractor by the owner shall not be withheld, unless they\r\nare the subject matter of the arbitration proceedings.\r\nAll awards shall be in writing and in case of awards amounting to Rs. 1.00 lakh and\r\nabove, such awards, shall state reasons for the amounts awards.\r\nNeither party is entitled to bring a claim to arbitration if the Arbitrator has not been\r\nappointed before the expiration of thirty days after defect liability period.\r\n(emphasis supplied)\r\n3. Respondent No. 1, by replies dated 23.11.1998 and 04.01.1999, did not agree to the Appellant\u2019s\r\nrequest on two main grounds:\r\na. That the arbitration was agreed to be conducted in accordance with the provision\r\nof the Indian Arbitration Act and any statutory modification thereof. Accordingly, the\r\nState of Gujarat had passed the Gujarat Public Works Contracts Disputes Arbitration\r\nTribunal Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \u201Cthe Gujarat Act\u201D). Therefore, the\r\ndisputes between the parties were to be adjudicated in accordance with the aforesaid\r\nstatute. b. That the arbitration was time barred, as Clause 38 mandated that neither\r\nparty was entitled to claim if the arbitrator has not been appointed before the\r\nexpiration of thirty days after the defect liability period\r\n4. In any case, the Appellant appointed Respondent No. 2 to act as a sole arbitrator\r\nfor adjudication of the disputes.\r\nRespondent No. 1 preferred an application under Section 16 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act\r\nof 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \u201Cthe Arbitration Act\u201D) disputing the jurisdiction of the sole\r\narbitrator. On 20.10.2001, the sole arbitrator rejected the application of the Respondent No. 1 and\r\nheld that the sole arbitrator had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute.\r\n5. Aggrieved by the order of the sole arbitrator, Respondent No. 1 preferred Special Civil Application\r\nNo. 400 of 2002, under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India before the High Court of\r\nGujarat. The Single Judge, while dismissing the Special Civil Application, held as under:\r\n\u201C\u2026\u2026At this stage, the judgment of the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of Konkan\r\nRailway Corporation Limited v. Mehul Construction Company, (2000) 7 SCC 201 is\r\nalso required to be considered along with the judgment of the Hon\u2019ble Supreme\r\nCourt in the case of SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618.\r\nConsidering the aforesaid two judgments of the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court and the\r\norder passed by the learned sole arbitrator passed under Section 16(4) of the Act\r\ndismissing the application submitted by the petitioner challenging the jurisdiction of\r\nrespondent no. 2 as a sole arbitrator and challenging his appointment as a sole\r\narbitrator, it is to be held that the petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the\r\nConstitution of India against the said order is not maintainable and\/or the same is\r\nnot required to entertained and the only remedy available to the petitioner is to wait\r\ntill the award is passed by the learned Sole Arbitrator and to challenge the same\r\nunder Section 34 of the Act\u2026\u201D\r\n6. Aggrieved by the order of the Single Judge, Respondent No. 1 preferred Letters\r\nPatent Appeal No. 182 of 2006 in Special Civil Application No. 400 of 2002. The\r\nHigh Court of Gujarat, by the impugned order dated 17.09.2012, allowed the appeal\r\nand observed the following:\r\n\u201C11. As discussed hereinabove, \u2018the contract\u2019 is a \u201Cworks Contract\u201D and a dispute is\r\nraised by the petitioner at the earliest available opportunity about the \u2018forum\u2019 in\r\nwhich the dispute be adjudicated. It was as early as on 23.11.1998, the appellant\r\ndenied that in view of Clause-38, wherein it is provided that, \u2018provision of Indian\r\nArbitration Act, 1940 and any statutory modification thereof will be applicable\u2019, the\r\nrespondent cannot appoint a sole arbitrator and thereafter cannot contend that now\r\nthat the Arbitrator is already appointed and he (the arbitrator) has already exercised\r\npower under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the\r\npetitioner has to wait till the arbitration award is passed, to challenge the same under\r\nSection 34 and Section 37 of the 1996 Act.\u201D\r\n7. Aggrieved, the Appellant filed this appeal by way of special leave petition.\r\n8. Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Division Bench of the High Court erred\r\nin interfering with the order of the Single Judge under Articles 226 and 227 of the\r\nConstitution. The fact that the final award has been passed by the sole Arbitrator and\r\nis now challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act clearly shows the attempt\r\nof Respondent No. 1 to bypass the framework laid down under the Arbitration Act.\r\nHe points out that Section 16(2) of the Arbitration Act mandates that the sole\r\narbitrator had the jurisdiction to adjudicate the preliminary issue of jurisdiction,\r\nwhich can only be challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.\r\n9. On the other hand, learned counsel for Respondent No. 1 contended that since the\r\nenactment of the Gujarat Act, the Arbitration Act was substituted with respect to the\r\ndisputes arising out of the works contract. It was contended that under Articles 226\r\nand 227 of the Constitution, it was always open for Respondent No. 1 to invoke the\r\nwrit jurisdiction of the High Court to set aside an arbitration which was a nullity as it\r\nwas in conflict with the State enactment.\r\n10. Having heard both parties and perusing the material available on record, the\r\nquestion which needs to be answered is whether the arbitral process could be\r\ninterfered under Article 226\/227 of the Constitution, and under what circumstance?\r\n11. We need to note that the Arbitration Act is a code in itself. This phrase is not\r\nmerely perfunctory, but has definite legal consequences. One such consequence is\r\nspelled out under Section 5 of the Arbitration Act, which reads as under\r\n\u201CNotwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in\r\nmatters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so\r\nprovided in this Part.\u201D The non-obstante clause is provided to uphold the intention of\r\nthe legislature as provided in the Preamble to adopt UNCITRAL Model Law and\r\nRules, to reduce excessive judicial interference which is not contemplated under the\r\nArbitration Act.\r\n12. The Arbitration Act itself gives various procedures and forums to challenge the\r\nappointment of an arbitrator. The framework clearly portrays an intention to address\r\nmost of the issues within the ambit of the Act itself, without there being scope for any\r\nextra statutory mechanism to provide just and fair solutions.\r\n13. Any party can enter into an arbitration agreement for resolving any disputes\r\ncapable of being arbitrable. Parties, while entering into such agreements, need to\r\nfulfill the basic ingredients provided under Section 7 of the Arbitration Act.\r\nArbitration being a creature of contract, gives a flexible framework for the parties to agree for their\r\nown procedure with minimalistic stipulations under the Arbitration Act.\r\n14. If parties fail to refer a matter to arbitration or to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the\r\nprocedure agreed by them, then a party can take recourse for court assistance under Section 8 or 11\r\nof the Arbitration Act.\r\n15. In this context, we may state that the Appellant acted in accordance with the procedure laid\r\ndown under the agreement to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator, without Respondent No. 1\r\nmounting a judicial challenge at that stage. Respondent No. 1 then appeared before the sole\r\narbitrator and challenged the jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator, in terms of Section 16(2) of the\r\nArbitration Act.\r\n16. Thereafter, Respondent No. 1 chose to impugn the order passed by the arbitrator under Section\r\n16(2) of the Arbitration Act through a petition under Article 226\/227 of the Indian Constitution. In\r\nthe usual course, the Arbitration Act provides for a mechanism of challenge under Section 34. The\r\nopening phase of Section 34 reads as \u2018Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made\r\nonly by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and subsection (3)\u2019. The use of term \u2018only\u2019 as occurring under the provision serves two purposes of making\r\nthe enactment a complete code and lay down the procedure.\r\n17. In any case, the hierarchy in our legal framework, mandates that a legislative enactment cannot\r\ncurtail a Constitutional right. In Nivedita Sharma v. Cellular Operators Association of India, (2011)\r\n14 SCC 337, this Court referred to several judgments and held:\r\n\u201C11. We have considered the respective arguments\/submissions. There cannot be any\r\ndispute that the power of the High Courts to issue directions, orders or writs\r\nincluding writs in the nature of habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus, quo warranto\r\nand prohibition under Article 226 of the Constitution is a basic feature of the\r\nConstitution and cannot be curtailed by parliamentary legislation - L. Chandra\r\nKumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261. However, it is one thing to say that in\r\nexercise of the power vested in it under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High\r\nCourt can entertain a writ petition against any order passed by or action taken by the\r\nState and\/or its agency\/ instrumentality or any public authority or order passed by a\r\nquasijudicial body\/authority, and it is an altogether different thing to say that each and every petition\r\nfiled under Article 226 of the Constitution must be entertained by the High Court as a matter of\r\ncourse ignoring the fact that the aggrieved person has an effective alternative remedy. Rather, it is\r\nsettled law that when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition\r\nshould not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation.\r\n(emphasis supplied) It is therefore, prudent for a Judge to not exercise discretion to allow judicial\r\ninterference beyond the procedure established under the enactment. This power needs to be\r\nexercised in exceptional rarity, wherein one party is left remediless under the statute or a clear \u2018bad\r\nfaith\u2019 shown by one of the parties. This high standard set by this Court is in terms of the legislative\r\nintention to make the arbitration fair and efficient\r\n18. In this context we may observe M\/s. Deep Industries Limited v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation\r\nLimited, (2019) SCC Online SC 1602, wherein interplay of Section 5 of the Arbitration Act and\r\nArticle 227 of the Constitution was analyzed as under:\r\n\u201C15. Most significant of all is the non- obstante clause contained in Section 5 which\r\nstates that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, in matters that arise\r\nunder Part I of the Arbitration Act, no judicial authority shall intervene except where\r\nso provided in this Part. Section 37 grants a constricted right of first appeal against\r\ncertain judgments and orders and no others. Further, the statutory mandate also\r\nprovides for one bite at the cherry, and interdicts a second appeal being filed (See\r\nSection 37(2) of the Act)\r\n16. This being the case, there is no doubt whatsoever that if petitions were to be filed\r\nunder Articles 226\/227 of the Constitution against orders passed in appeals under\r\nSection 37, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and would not come to\r\nfruition for many years. At the same time, we cannot forget that Article 227 is a\r\nconstitutional provision which remains untouched by the non-obstante clause of\r\nSection 5 of the Act. In these circumstances, what is important to note is that though\r\npetitions can be filed under Article 227 against judgments allowing or dismissing first\r\nappeals under Section 37 of the Act, yet the High Court would be extremely\r\ncircumspect in interfering with the same, taking into account the statutory policy as\r\nadumbrated by us herein above so that interference is restricted to orders that are\r\npassed which are patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction.\u201D\r\n19. In the instant case, Respondent No. 1 has not been able to show exceptional circumstance or \u2018bad\r\nfaith\u2019 on the part of the Appellant, to invoke the remedy under Article 227 of the Constitution. No\r\ndoubt the ambit of Article 227 is broad and pervasive, however, the High Court should not have used\r\nits inherent power to interject the arbitral process at this stage. It is brought to our notice that\r\nsubsequent to the impugned order of the sole arbitrator, a final award was rendered by him on\r\nmerits, which is challenged by the Respondent No. 1 in a separate Section 34 application, which is\r\npending.\r\n20. Viewed from a different perspective, the arbitral process is strictly conditioned upon time\r\nlimitation and modeled on the \u2018principle of unbreakability\u2019. This Court in P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok\r\nKumar, (2019) 13 SCC 445, observed:\r\n36.3. Third, Section 34(3) reflects the principle of unbreakability. Dr Peter Binder in\r\nInternational Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL Model Law\r\nJurisdictions, 2nd Edn., observed:\r\n\u201CAn application for setting aside an award can only be made during the three months\r\nfollowing the date on which the party making the application has received the award.\r\nOnly if a party has made a request for correction or interpretation of the award under\r\nArticle 33 does the time-limit of three months begin after the tribunal has disposed of\r\nthe request. This exception from the three-month time-limit was subject to criticism\r\nin the working group due to fears that it could be used as a delaying tactics. However,\r\nalthough \u201Can unbreakable time-limit for applications for setting aside\u201D was sought as\r\nbeing desirable for the sake of \u201Ccertainty and expediency\u201D the prevailing view was\r\nthat the words ought to be retained \u201Csince they presented the reasonable consequence\r\nof Article 33\u201D.\r\nAccording to this \u201Cunbreakability\u201D of time-limit and true to the \u201Ccertainty and expediency\u201D of the\r\narbitral awards, any grounds for setting aside the award that emerge after the threemonth time-limit has expired cannot be raised.\r\n37. Extending Section 17 of the Limitation Act would go contrary to the principle of \u201Cunbreakability\u201D\r\nenshrined under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act.\r\n(emphasis supplied) If the Courts are allowed to interfere with the arbitral process beyond the ambit\r\nof the enactment, then the efficiency of the process will be diminished.\r\n21. The High Court did not appreciate the limitations under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution\r\nand reasoned that the Appellant had undertaken to appoint an arbitrator unilaterally, thereby\r\nrendering the Respondent No. 1 remediless. However, a plain reading of the arbitration agreement\r\npoints to the fact that the Appellant herein had actually acted in accordance with the procedure laid\r\ndown without any mala fides.\r\n22. Respondent No. 1 did not take legal recourse against the appointment of the sole arbitrator, and\r\nrather submitted themselves before the tribunal to adjudicate on the jurisdiction issue as well as on\r\nthe merits. In this situation, the Respondent No. 1 has to endure the natural consequences of\r\nsubmitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator, which can be challenged, through an\r\napplication under Section 34. It may be noted that in the present case, the award has already been\r\npassed during the pendency of this appeal, and the Respondent No. 1 has already preferred a\r\nchallenge under Section 34 to the same. Respondent No. 1 has not been able to show any exceptional\r\ncircumstance, which mandates the exercise of jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n23. The Division Bench further opined that the contract between the parties was in the nature of a\r\nworks contract as it held that the manufacturing of bricks, as required under the contract, was only\r\nan ancillary obligation while the primary obligation on the Appellant was to supply the bricks. The\r\nDivision Bench therefore held that the Gujarat Act holds the field, and not the Arbitration Act.\r\n24. The Gujarat Act was enacted in 1992 with the object to provide for the constitution of a tribunal\r\nto arbitrate disputes particularly arising from works contract to which the State Government or a\r\npublic undertaking is a party. A works contract is defined under Section 2(k) of the Gujarat Act. The\r\ndefinition includes within itself a contract for supply of goods relating to the execution of any of the\r\nworks specified under the section. However, a plain reading of the contract between the parties\r\nindicates that it was for both manufacturing as well as supply of bricks. Importantly, a contract for\r\nmanufacture simpliciter is not a works contract under the definition provided under Section 2(k).\r\nThe pertinent question therefore is whether the present contract, which is composite in nature, falls\r\nwithin the ambit of a works contract under Section 2(k) of the Gujarat Act. This is a question that\r\nrequires contractual interpretation, and is a matter of evidence, especially when both parties have\r\ntaken contradictory stands regarding this issue. It is a settled law that the interpretation of contracts\r\nin such cases shall generally not be done in the writ jurisdiction. Further, the mere fact that the\r\nGujarat Act might apply may not be sufficient for the writ courts to entertain the plea of Respondent\r\nNo. 1 to challenge the ruling of the arbitrator under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act.\r\n25. It must be noted that Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, necessarily mandates that the issue of\r\njurisdiction must be dealt first by the tribunal, before the Court examines the same under Section\r\n34. Respondent No. 1 is therefore not left remediless, and has statutorily been provided a chance of\r\nappeal. In Deep Industries case (supra), this Court observed as follows:\r\n\u201C22. One other feature of this case is of some importance. As stated herein above, on\r\n09.05.2018, a Section 16 application had been dismissed by the learned Arbitrator in\r\nwhich substantially the same contention which found favour with the High Court was\r\ntaken up. The drill of Section 16 of the Act is that where a Section 16 application is\r\ndismissed, no appeal is provided and the challenge to the Section 16 application being\r\ndismissed must await the passing of a final award at which stage it may be raised\r\nunder Section 34.\u201D (emphasis supplied)\r\n26. In view of the above reasoning, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court erred in\r\nutilizing its discretionary power available under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution herein.\r\nThus, the appeal is allowed and the impugned Order of the High Court is set aside. There shall be no\r\norder as to costs.

A fortnight prior to the recording of his evidence, Daansingh was murdered on 11\r\nSeptember 2017. \u201CIPC\u201D 4 On 12 September 2017, FIR No. 732 of 2017 was registered at Police\r\nStation Mathuraghat by the brother of the appellant for offences punishable under Sections 147,\r\n148, 149, 323, 341, 307, 302 and 336 of the IPC and Sections 3\/25 and 4\/25 of the Arms Act 1959.\r\nThe second respondent was arrested on 3 October 2017. After investigation, the final report under\r\nSection 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code 1973 2 was submitted on 28 December 2017 in\r\nwhich the second respondent has been named as an accused.\r\n5 The second respondent was denied bail by the High Court on 6 April 2018, 5 September 2019 and\r\n8 September 2020. In its order dated 5 September 2019, the High Court noted:\r\n\u201C5. [\u2026] I.O. is present in person in the Court, who has produced the calls details. It is\r\ninformed by Investigating Officer that two mobiles were recovered from the\r\npetitioner and from I.M.E.I. number, it is revealed that different sims were used in\r\nthese mobiles and two sims that was used, petitioner was in contact with Prahlad and\r\nher son Anek Singh, who is also accused in this case. It is also informed that day prior\r\nto the incident, petitioner and one Bhuria came to the office of A.S.I and threatened\r\nto murder Dansingh. It is also informed that petitioner informed the shooter about\r\nmovement of the deceased and she was constantly in touch with Prahlad and her\r\nson-Anek Singh.\u201D\r\n6 By its order dated 8 September 2020, the High Court, while dismissing the fourth bail application,\r\nalso observed that the second respondent was not co- operating in the investigation.\r\n \u201CCrPC\u201D\r\ng The High Court has allowed the fifth application for bail of the second\r\nrespondent observing that\r\n(i) The second respondent is a woman;\r\n(ii) She has been in custody for three years and ten months;\r\n(iii) No overt act was assigned to her in the present case;\r\n(iv) Co-accused Vijaypal has been granted bail;\r\n(v) There is a variance in the story of the prosecution in respect of the location of the second\r\nrespondent; and\r\n(vi) The conclusion of the trial is likely to take time. 8 Mr Namit Saxena, counsel appearing on\r\nbehalf of the appellant submitted that:\r\n(i) The High Court is in error in proceeding on the basis that no overt act is attributed\r\nto the second respondent since the charge-sheet, which has been submitted after\r\ninvestigation, indicates that a. The second respondent was using as many as four sim\r\ncards and was in constant contact with Prahlad, the co-accused who was hired as a\r\nsharp shooter, and her son Anek, who is also a co-accused; and b. The second\r\nrespondent was the custodian of the weapons used in the crime;\r\n(ii) The High Court had in its order dated 8 September 2020 specifically noted that\r\nthe second respondent was not co-operating in the investigation of the case;\r\n(iii) Four earlier bail applications have been rejected and there was no change in the\r\ncircumstances to warrant the grant of bail;\r\n(iv) No parity could be claimed with the co-accused Vijaypal since he has not been\r\ncharge-sheeted;\r\n(v) The investigation has revealed that the deceased was murdered with the aid of a\r\nhired sharp-shooter shortly before he was to depose at the criminal trial in the case\r\narising out of FIR No. 466 of 2015 under Section 307 of the IPC;\r\n(vi) The second respondent, as the prosecution alleges, was following the car of the\r\ndeceased and was providing instructions about his location to the sharpshooter; and\r\n(vii) Even the brother of the appellant, Gopal Singh, was assaulted shortly before his testimony was\r\nto be recorded.\r\n9 On the other hand, Mr Vivek Sood, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the second respondent\r\nsubmitted that:\r\n(i) The incident took place outside the house of the deceased in which event, the role\r\nattributed to the second respondent is rendered meaningless;\r\n(ii) There has been a clear over-implication of members of the family in the FIR since\r\nas many as six persons are alleged to have shot at the deceased whereas only two\r\nbullets were recovered;\r\n(iii) Two of the persons named in the FIR have not been charge-sheeted;\r\n(iv) The second respondent is sixty years old and was released on bail after being in\r\ncustody for three years and ten months;\r\n(v) 28 out of 58 witnesses have been examined and the trial is likely to take some\r\ntime; and\r\n(vi) Anek Singh with whom the second respondent is alleged to have been in contact\r\nis her son, while Prahlad, the alleged sharp-shooter, is a relative and hence there\r\nwould be nothing untoward in the mobile contact.\r\n10 Ms Ritika Jhurani, counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Rajasthan submitted that:\r\n(i) The High Court has not considered the gravity of the crime while granting bail to\r\nthe second respondent;\r\n(ii) No parity could have been claimed with co-accused Vijaypal who was granted bail\r\nsince he was not found to be involved in the incident and was not chargesheeted; and\r\n(iii) On the other hand, the second respondent was found to be directly involved in the conspiracy of\r\na pre-meditated murder.\r\n11 In Anil Kumar Yadav v. State (NCT of Delhi) 3, this Court has spelt out some of the significant\r\nconsiderations which must be placed in the balance in deciding whether to grant bail:\r\n(2018) 12 SCC 129 \u201C17. While granting bail, the relevant considerations are: (i) nature\r\nof seriousness of the offence; (ii) character of the evidence and circumstances which\r\nare peculiar to the accused; and (iii) likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice;\r\n(iv) the impact that his release may make on the prosecution witnesses, its impact on\r\nthe society; and (v) likelihood of his tampering. No doubt, this list is not exhaustive.\r\nThere are no hard-and-fast rules regarding grant or refusal of bail, each case has to be\r\nconsidered on its own merits. The matter always calls for judicious exercise of\r\ndiscretion by the Court.\u201D\r\n12 While granting bail in the present case, the High Court has observed that \u201Cno overt act is assigned\r\nto her (the second respondent) in the present case\u201D. These observations are erroneous. The final\r\nreport under Section 173 of the CrPC indicates that the investigation has revealed that :\r\n(i) The second respondent was using as many as four sim cards and was in touch with\r\none of the sharp-shooters who was hired to commit the crime; and\r\n(ii) She was the custodian of the weapons which were stored at the rental premises\r\nwhere she resided.\r\n13 On the first aspect, the charge-sheet contains the following details in regard to the use of the\r\nmobile numbers of the second respondent:\r\n\u201CFrom them analysis of these Call Details, following facts have come to light:\r\n1. Mobile Number: [xxxxxxxx00] (Omvati): - The Call details of this Mobile Number\r\nwere procured from date 01.08.2017 onwards until the date of occurrence of the case\r\nincident and found that said number was active until the date 09.09.2017 after the\r\naforesaid date of 01.08.2017 and its corresponding IMEI Number was found to be\r\n[xxxxxxxxxxxx810]. It has also come to light that after said date 09.09.2017, in said\r\nmobile phone of IMEI: [xxxxxxxxxxxx810], some other SIM was found to be active or\r\nnot to find out the same, the Call Details corresponding to said IMEI No.\r\n[xxxxxxxxxxxx810] was obtained for Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx36] in the course of\r\nwhich it came to be known that said Mobile Number was active until the date of\r\nincident 11.09.2017.\r\n2. Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx36] (Omvati): - Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx36] related\r\nSIM Card was found to have been issued in the name of Guddi wife of Shri Lalsingh,\r\nR\/o;\r\nSabaura, District: Bharatpur, Omvati has used the Mobile Phone of IMEI No: [xxxxxxxxxxxx810] in\r\nthe past for making and receiving calls to and from Mobile No: [xxxxxxxx00] and then from the\r\nsame mobile later also operated Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx36] which clearly indicates that said\r\nMobile has been used by Omvati only and not Guddi. When the call details of Mobile Number\r\n[xxxxxxxx36] was analysed it was found that the mobile location on date 11.09.2017 as Kumher,\r\nNagla Baghera Post Bauraayi, Anand Nagar, Bharatpur, Ranjit Nagar, Bharatpur, near Railway\r\nStation: Bharatpur and found that from said Number, she has made several calls and conversed with\r\nother Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx31].\u201D 14 The mobile number with which the cell phone of the second\r\nrespondent was in contact with is of the co-accused Prahlad, who is alleged to be a hired sharpshooter. Apart from the above two mobile numbers, there were two other mobile numbers which\r\nwere in the use by the second respondent, as indicated in the following extracts from the\r\ncharge-sheet:\r\n\u201C7. Mobile Number: [xxxxxxxx57] (Omvati):- In the course of investigation, in this\r\ncase matter, it has come to light that Mobile No: [xxxxxxxx57] has been used in the\r\nname of one Pradeep son of Udaysingh resident of Badeeka, Tehsil Kathoomar,\r\nDistrict: Alwar and its IMEI [xxxxxxxxxxxx960] was under consistent usage too. On\r\nthe date of occurrence of the case incident i. e., 11.09.2017, the location of this\r\nnumber was traced as Ashok Nagar, Near: Subhash Nagar, Bharatpur, Nagal Ganga,\r\nTehsil: Kumher, Kumher, Rarah. Said IMEI based CDR was obtained fro[m] which it\r\nwas found that [xxxxxxxx89] was an active number and was found to be under the\r\nusage of Omvati.\r\n8. Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx89] (Omvati):- this Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx89] was\r\nfound to have been issued in the name of Omvati \u2013 wife of Ratansingh \u2013 resident of\r\nSabaura, Police Station: Kumher, Bharatpur and on analysing the CDR of said\r\nnumber it was found to have been used in an instruments or instrument of IMEI\r\nNumbers [xxxxxxxxxxxx970] and [xxxxxxxxxxxx960]. When the CDR of IMEI No.\r\n[xxxxxxxxxxxx960] was procured, it was found that Mobile Number [xxxxxxxx57]\r\nrelated SIM card has been used in it. In this way, it has become apparent that said\r\nMobile No:\r\n[xxxxxxxx57] was used by Omvati wife of Ratansingh, resident of Sabaura, Kumher,\r\nBharatpur and the aforesaid IMEIs [xxxxxxxxxxxx970] & [xxxxxxxxxxxx960] were\r\nused from a single Mobile Handset by her. On 11.09.2017 \u2013 i. e. the date of\r\noccurrence of this case incident, its location was traced as Ashok Vihar, Subhash\r\nNagar, Bharatpur, Kumher, Ranjeet Nagar, Bharatpur, Near Railway Station\r\nBharatpur etc.\u201D\r\n15 The charge-sheet contains an analysis of the call data records. Apart from the material drawn\r\nfrom the call data records, it has been found during the course of the investigation that in order to\r\npurchase the fire arms for the crime, Ratan Singh, the husband of the second respondent, had paid\r\nan advance of Rs. 40,000 to Prahlad. Prahlad had brought three katas and ten cartridges. The\r\nweapons were kept in a room by Anek Singh at Bharatpur in which the second respondent was\r\nresiding on a rental basis. Moreover, there is a specific allegation that the second respondent has\r\nactively aided the commission of the crime by furnishing information about the movements of the\r\ndeceased (Daansingh) to the killers. There has been an evident error on the part of the High Court in\r\nsurmising that no specific or overt act is attributed to the second respondent. As regards the\r\nco-accused Vijaypal, it has been submitted that during the course of the investigation he was not\r\nfound to be present at the scene of the offence and was not charge-sheeted. 16 In deciding as to\r\nwhether the fifth bail application of the second respondent should be allowed, the High Court has\r\nfailed to consider the seriousness and gravity of the crime and the specific role which is attributed to\r\nthe second respondent. The deceased was due to testify in the trial in the prior case under Section\r\n307 of the IPC and the murder was committed barely a fortnight prior to the date on which he was\r\nto depose. The High Court had rejected four previous bail applications. There was no change in\r\ncircumstances. In this backdrop, the High Court having failed to notice material circumstances\r\nbearing upon the grant of bail to the second respondent and, as noted above, having proceeded on a\r\npalpable erroneous basis, a case for the setting aside of the order of the High Court has been duly\r\nestablished. 17 In Mahipal v. Rajesh Kumar 4, one of us (Justice DY Chandrachud), speaking for a\r\ntwo-judge Bench of this Court, after adverting to the precedents on the subject, enunciated the\r\nconsiderations which must weigh in the determination of whether bail should be granted:\r\n\u201C13. The principles that guide this Court in assessing the correctness of an order\r\n[Ashish Chatterjee v. State of W.B., CRM No. 272 of 2010, order dated 11-1-2010\r\n(Cal)] passed by the High Court granting bail were succinctly laid down by this Court\r\nin Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee [Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis\r\nChatterjee, (2010) 14 SCC 496 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 765] . In that case, the accused\r\nwas facing trial for an offence punishable under Section 302 of the Penal Code.\r\nSeveral bail applications filed by the accused were dismissed by the Additional Chief\r\nJudicial Magistrate. The High Court in turn allowed the bail application filed by the\r\naccused. Setting aside the order [Ashish Chatterjee v. State of W.B., CRM No. 272 of\r\n2010, order dated 11-1-2010 (Cal)] of the High Court, D.K. Jain, J., (2020) 2 SCC 118\r\nspeaking for a two-Judge Bench of this Court, held: (SCC pp.\r\n499-500, paras 9-10) \u201C9. \u2026 It is trite that this Court does not, normally, interfere with an order\r\n[Ashish Chatterjee v. State of W.B., CRM No. 272 of 2010, order dated 11-1-2010 (Cal)] passed by\r\nthe High Court granting or rejecting bail to the accused. However, it is equally incumbent upon the\r\nHigh Court to exercise its discretion judiciously, cautiously and strictly in compliance with the basic\r\nprinciples laid down in a plethora of decisions of this Court on the point. It is well settled that,\r\namong other circumstances, the factors to be borne in mind while considering an application for bail\r\nare:\r\n(i) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused\r\nhad committed the offence;\r\n(ii) nature and gravity of the accusation;\r\n(iii) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction;\r\n(iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if released on bail;\r\n(v) character, behaviour, means, position and standing of the accused;\r\n(vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated;\r\n(vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being influenced; and\r\n(viii) danger, of course, of justice being thwarted by grant of bail.\r\n***\r\n10. It is manifest that if the High Court does not advert to these relevant considerations and\r\nmechanically grants bail, the said order would suffer from the vice of non-application of mind,\r\nrendering it to be illegal.\u201D [\u2026]\r\n15. The decision of this Court in Prasanta [Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee, (2010) 14\r\nSCC 496 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 765] has been consistently followed by this Court in Ash Mohammad v.\r\nShiv Raj Singh [Ash Mohammad v. Shiv Raj Singh, (2012) 9 SCC 446 : (2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 1172] ,\r\nRanjit Singh v. State of M.P. [Ranjit Singh v. State of M.P., (2013) 16 SCC 797 : (2014) 6 SCC (Cri)\r\n405] , Neeru Yadav v. State of U.P. [Neeru Yadav v. State of U.P., (2014) 16 SCC 508 : (2015) 3 SCC\r\n(Cri) 527] , Virupakshappa Gouda v. State of Karnataka [Virupakshappa Gouda v. State of\r\nKarnataka, (2017) 5 SCC 406 : (2017) 2 SCC (Cri) 542] and State of Orissa v. Mahimananda Mishra\r\n[State of Orissa v. Mahimananda Mishra, (2018) 10 SCC 516 : (2019) 1 SCC (Cri) 325].\u201D 18 The Court\r\nnoted that the considerations which must weigh in the exercise of the power of the appellate court to\r\ndetermine whether bail has been granted for valid reasons stand on a distinct footing from an\r\napplication for cancellation of bail. The Court observed:\r\n\u201C16. The considerations that guide the power of an appellate court in assessing the\r\ncorrectness of an order granting bail stand on a different footing from an assessment\r\nof an application for the cancellation of bail. The correctness of an order granting bail\r\nis tested on the anvil of whether there was an improper or arbitrary exercise of the\r\ndiscretion in the grant of bail. The test is whether the order granting bail is perverse,\r\nillegal or unjustified. On the other hand, an application for cancellation of bail is\r\ngenerally examined on the anvil of the existence of supervening circumstances or\r\nviolations of the conditions of bail by a person to whom bail has been granted.\u201D (See\r\nalso in this context the judgment in Ramesh Bhavan Rathod v. Vishanbhai Hirabhai\r\nMakwana Koli 5) and Harjit Singh v. Inderpreet Singh alias Inder 6)\r\n19 On the touchstone of the above decisions and for the reasons we have indicated above, the\r\nimpugned order granting bail is unsustainable. The High Court has failed to notice relevant\r\ncircumstances bearing on the seriousness and gravity of the crime and the role attributed to the\r\nsecond respondent. The High Court has proceeded on the erroneous basis that no overt act has been\r\nassigned to the second respondent. There was no change in circumstances warranting the grant of\r\nbail.\r\n(2021) 6 SCC 230 2021 SCC OnLine SC 633 20 For the above reasons we allow the appeal and set\r\naside the impugned judgment and order of the Single Judge at the Jaipur Bench of the High Court of\r\nJudicature for Rajasthan dated 11 August 2021 in SB Criminal Miscellaneous Fifth Bail Application\r\nNo. 11627 of 2021. The application for bail filed by the second respondent shall consequently stand\r\nrejected. The second respondent shall surrender on or before 7 November 2021.\r\n21 The observations made in this judgment are only for the purpose of considering the application\r\nfor bail and shall have no bearing on the merits of the case or the pending trial.\r\n22 Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.\r\n\u2026..\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...............................J.

          "judgement":"SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.\r\n1. Dayashankar Chaurasia, the respondent issued eight (8) cheques of Rs.20,000\/- each totalling to\r\nRs.1,60,000\/- in favour of M\/s. Bell Marshall Telesystems Limited (for short \u2018the Company\u2019). The\r\ncheques were drawn on HDFC Bank, Vasai (E) Branch, Mumbai. These cheques were drawn on\r\ndifferent dates but were presented together for payment on 10.05.2006. All the cheques got\r\ndishonoured on account of \u201Cfunds insufficient\u201D as per Bank Memos issued on 12.05.2006. On the\r\ncheques being dishonoured, legal notices were issued by the beneficiary under Section 138(b) of the\r\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018NI Act\u2019) on 26.05.2006. The\r\ndemand was, however not met within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the notice nor was any reply\r\nsent which resulted in the complaint bearing No.160\/SS\/07 being filed on 07.07.2006 by Mr.\r\nBhupesh Rathod before the Special Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai. The complaint was\r\naccompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company dated 17.05.2006 authorising Mr. Bhupesh\r\nRathod to initiate legal action against the respondent on behalf of the Company. On 24.12.2007, the\r\nCompany filed an affidavit through its Managing Director, i.e., Mr. Bhupesh Rathod, stating that it\r\nhad authorised him through the abovementioned Board Resolution to file a complaint case against\r\nthe respondent2. In view of the fact that much turns on the manner of description of the complainant, we\r\nreproduce the description of the complainant as under:\r\n\u201CMr. Bhupesh M. Rathod Managing Director of M\/s. Bell Marshall Telesystems Ltd.\r\nAged: 41 years, Occupation: Business Having address at 1107, V Maker Chamber,\r\nNariman Point Mumbai- 400021.\u201D\r\n3. The Board Resolution passed on 17.05.2006 is in the following terms:\r\n\u201CRESOLVED THAT legal action be initiated against Dayashankar Prasad Choursiya\r\nfor the dishonour of chqs issued by him and in discharge of this liabilities to the\r\ncompany and Mr. Bhupesh Rathod\/Sashikant Ganekar is hereby authorized to\r\nappoint advocates, issues of notices through advocate, file complaint, Verifications on\r\nOath, appoint Constituent attorney to file complaint in the court and attend all such\r\naffairs which may be needed in the process of legal actions.\u201D For Bell Marshal Tele\r\nSystems LTD.\r\nSd\/-\r\nDated: 17\/05\/2006 Director\u201D\r\n4. We reproduce the aforesaid as the competency and the manner of filing of the complaint are the\r\nprimary considerations debated before us.\r\n5. The case made out in the complaint is that a sum of Rs.1,60,000\/- was advanced to the\r\nrespondent by the Company and the cheques were issued to repay the loan. The respondent took an\r\nobjection that the complaint was filed in the personal capacity of Mr. Bhupesh Rathod and not on\r\nbehalf of the Company. While on the other hand it was contended by the appellant that the\r\ncomplaint was in the name of the Company and in the cause title of the complaint he had described\r\nhimself as the Managing Director. The Company was a registered company under the Companies\r\nAct, 1956. The registration certificate, however, was not placed on record. On this aspect, it was the\r\nfurther submission of the respondent that it is only in the aforesaid title description that the\r\ncomplainant is described as the Managing Director of the Company but in the body of the complaint\r\nit is not so mentioned.\r\n6. The trial court acquitted the respondent on 12.03.2009 based on a dual reasoning \u2013\r\n(a) there was no document except the promissory note signed by the respondent to show that the\r\nloan was being granted; and\r\n(b) the Board Resolution itself was not signed by the Board of Directors (it may be stated that this\r\nwas really a true copy of the Board Resolution).\r\n7. The appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court. The High Court by the impugned order\r\ndated 03.08.2015 dismissed the appeal.\r\n8. It may be relevant to note that the High Court traversed many paths while coming to this\r\nconclusion. In a nutshell the reasoning was:\r\n(a) it could not be said that the complaint had been filed by a payee or holder in due\r\ncourse as mandated under Section 142(a) of the NI Act;\r\n(b) the payee was the Company and a perusal of the complaint did not show that the\r\ncomplaint was filed by the Company. It had been filed by the appellant who had\r\ndescribed himself as the Managing Director of the Company only in the cause title of\r\nthe complaint;\r\n(c) probably a conscious choice was made to not file the complaint in the name of the\r\nCompany as it was unclear whether the Company was authorised to advance loans.\r\n9. We may note that the High Court did not give its imprimatur to the entire reasoning of the trial\r\ncourt as it noticed that the demand notice was sent on behalf of the Company. Thus, the Company\r\nwas aware that the complaint had to be filed by the Company itself. It was observed that the\r\naforesaid aspect was probably left vague on purpose by the Company and therefore, it was opined\r\nthat the complaint had not been filed by the payee in terms of Section 142 of the NI Act.\r\nComplainant\u2019s\/Appellant\u2019s submissions:\r\n10. The appellant contended before us that it was quite apparent from the cause title of the\r\ncomplaint which is an integral part of the complaint, that the same had been filed on behalf of the\r\nCompany. It was further contended that this was the reason that the Board Resolution authorising\r\nthe Managing Director to file a complaint for dishonour of the cheques was annexed. The address\r\ngiven was of the Company, which was the registered office address. The affidavit filed in the\r\ncross-examination in pursuance thereto left no manner of doubt that the complaint was filed as the\r\nManaging Director of the Company.\r\n11. It is the say of the appellant that there is a presumption under Section 139 and 118 of the NI Act\r\nwhich was not rebutted by the respondent. It was further contended that a duly signed cheque was\r\nsufficient to raise a presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act against the respondent as held in\r\nTriyambak S. Hegde v. Sripad1. It was not the say of the respondent in defence that the cheque was\r\nnot signed by him or was signed under any fraud or misrepresentation.\r\n12. It was submitted that a very hyper technical view of the matter had been taken and it only related\r\nto the format of the filing of the complaint and not the substance. The trial court itself had accepted\r\nthat the complaint was filed on behalf of the Company as otherwise it would have refused to take\r\ncognizance under Section 142(a) of the NI Act. The Crl. Appeal Nos. 849\u2212850\/2011 decided on\r\n23.09.2021. respondent had not even challenged the summoning order on the ground that the\r\ncomplaint is not filed on behalf of the Company. Respondent\u2019s submissions:\r\n13. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, contended that the appellant had failed to prove\r\nhis case beyond reasonable doubt and the complaint itself was not in a proper form. The complaint\r\nand the Board Resolution did not lead to a conclusion that it was filed on behalf of the Company.\r\nThe Board Resolution was also not signed by the Directors of the Company nor does it find that it\r\nauthorises the complainant to file the complaint.\r\n14. The respondent also contended that no loan was advanced by the Company nor has it been\r\nproved as to whose account the alleged loan was advanced to. No loan agreement in favour of the\r\nCompany was placed on record.\r\nOur View:\r\n15. We have examined the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties.\r\n16. To decide the controversy the relevant Sections of the NI Act are extracted as under:\r\n\u201C138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account. \u2014 Where\r\nany cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for\r\npayment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the\r\ndischarge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank\r\nunpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account\r\nis insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid\r\nfrom that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be\r\ndeemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other\r\nprovision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for [a term which may be\r\nextended to two years], or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the\r\ncheque, or with both:\r\nProvided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless--\r\n(a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the\r\ndate on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;\r\n(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a\r\ndemand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice; in writing,\r\nto the drawer of the cheque, [within thirty days] of the receipt of information by him\r\nfrom the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and\r\n(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of money\r\nto the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within\r\nfifteen days of the receipt of the said notice.\u201D \r\n\u201C139. Presumption in favour of holder.\u2014 It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the\r\nholder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in section 138 for the discharge, in\r\nwhole or in part, of any debt or other liability.\u201D .... .... .... .... ....\r\n\u201C118. Presumptions as to negotiable instruments.\u2014 Until the contrary is proved, the following\r\npresumptions shall be made:\r\n\u2014\r\n(g) that holder is a holder in due course:\u2014 that the holder of a negotiable instrument\r\nis a holder in due course : provided that, where the instrument has been obtained\r\nfrom its lawful owner, or from any person in lawful custody thereof, by means of an\r\noffence or fraud, or has been obtained from the maker or acceptor thereof by means\r\nof an offence or fraud, or for unlawful consideration, the burden of proving that the\r\nholder is a holder in due course lies upon him.\u201D .... .... .... .... ....\r\n\u201C142. Cognizance of offences.\u2014 Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal\r\nProcedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), \u2014\r\n(a) no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a\r\ncomplaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the\r\ncheque;\r\n(b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under\r\nclause (c) of the proviso to section 138:\r\n[Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the Court after the\r\nprescribed period, if the complainant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause\r\nfor not making a complaint within such period;]\r\n(c) no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of\r\nthe first class shall try any offence punishable under section 138.\u201D\r\n17. We must say at the inception that the respondent not having disputed his\r\nsignatures on the cheques, it was for the respondent to show in what circumstances\r\nthe cheques had been issued, i.e., why was it not a cheque issued in due course. The\r\nwords of Section 139 of the NI Act are quite clear that unless the contrary is proved, it\r\nshall be presumed that the holder of the cheque received the cheque of the nature\r\nreferred to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other\r\nliability. The respondent has not set up a case that the nature of transaction was of\r\nthe nature which fell beyond the scope of Section 138.\r\nOther than taking a technical objection, really nothing has been said on the substantive aspect.\r\n18. The only eligibility criteria prescribed under Section 142(1)(a) is that the complaint must be by\r\nthe payee or the holder in due course.\r\n19. In the conspectus of the aforesaid principles we have to deal with the plea of the respondent that\r\nthe complaint was not filed by the competent complainant as it is the case that the loan was\r\nadvanced by the Company. As to what would be the governing principles in respect of a corporate\r\nentity which seeks to file the complaint, an elucidation can be found in the judgment of this Court in\r\nAssociated Cement Co. Ltd. v. Keshavanand2. If a complaint was made in the name of the Company,\r\nit is necessary that a natural person represents such juristic person in the court and the court looks\r\nupon the natural person for all practical purposes. It is in this context that observations were made\r\nthat the body corporate is a de jure complainant while the human being is a de facto complainant to\r\nrepresent the former in the court proceedings. Thus, no Magistrate could insist that the particular\r\nperson whose statement was taken on oath alone can continue to represent the Company till the end\r\nof the proceedings. Not only that, even if there was initially no authority the Company can at any\r\nstage rectify that defect by sending a competent person.\r\n20. The aforesaid judgment was also taken note of in a subsequent judgment of this Court in\r\nM.M.TC Ltd. & Anr. v. Medchl Chemicals and Pharma (P) Ltd. & Anr.3.\r\n21. We find that the judicial precedents cited aforesaid have been breached by the Courts below. The\r\nHigh Court also embarked on a (1998) 1 SCC 687.\r\n(2002) 1 SCC 234.\r\ndiscussion as to the vagueness of the identity of the complainant and its relation with the legality of\r\na loan which may be granted by the Company, something that was not required to be gone into.\r\n22. If we look at the format of the complaint which we have extracted aforesaid, it is quite apparent\r\nthat the Managing Director has filed the complaint on behalf of the Company. There could be a\r\nformat where the Company\u2019s name is described first, suing through the Managing Director but there\r\ncannot be a fundamental defect merely because the name of the Managing Director is stated first\r\nfollowed by the post held in the Company.\r\n23. It is also relevant to note that a copy of the Board Resolution was filed along with the complaint.\r\nAn affidavit had been brought on record in the trial court by the Company, affirming to the factum\r\nof authorisation in favour of the Managing Director. A Manager or a Managing Director ordinarily\r\nby the very nomenclature can be taken to be the person in-charge of the affairs Company for its\r\nday-to-day management and within the activity would certainly be calling the act of approaching the\r\ncourt either under civil law or criminal law for setting the trial in motion.4 It would be too technical\r\na view to take to defeat the complaint merely because the body of the complaint does not elaborate\r\nupon the authorisation. The artificial person being the Company had to act through a\r\nperson\/official, which logically would include the Chairman or Managing Director. Only the\r\nexistence of authorisation could be verified\r\n24. While we turn to the authorisation in the present case, it was a copy and, thus, does not have to\r\nbe signed by the Board Members, as that would form a part of the minutes of the Board meeting and\r\nnot a true copy of the authorisation. We also feel that it has been wrongly concluded that the\r\nManaging Director was not authorised. If we peruse the authorisation in the form of a certified copy\r\nof the Resolution, it states that legal action has to be taken against the respondent for dishonour of\r\ncheques issued by him to discharge his liabilities to the Company. To this effect, Mr. Bhupesh\r\nRathod\/Sashikant Ganekar were authorised to appoint advocates, issues notices through advocate,\r\nfile complaint, verifications on oath, appoint Constituent attorney to file complaint in the court and\r\nattend all such affairs which may be needed in the process of legal actions. What more could be\r\nsaid? Credential Finance Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra 1998(3) Mh.L.J. 805.\r\n25. The finding by the Courts below as to the lack of authorisation to depose also, thus, stands\r\nnullified.\r\n26. The description of the complainant with its full registered office address is given at the inception\r\nitself except that the Managing Director\u2019s name appears first as acting on behalf of the Company.\r\nThe affidavit and the cross-examination in respect of the same during trial supports the finding that\r\nthe complaint had been filed by the Managing Director on behalf of the Company. Thus, the format\r\nitself cannot be said to be defective though it may not be perfect. The body of the complaint need not\r\nbe required to contain anything more in view of what has been set out at the inception coupled with\r\nthe copy of the Board Resolution. There is no reason to otherwise annex a copy of the Board\r\nResolution if the complaint was not being filed by the appellant on behalf of the Company.\r\n27. In our view, one of the most material aspects is, as stated aforesaid, that the signatures on the\r\ncheques were not denied. Neither was it explained by way of an alternative story as to why the duly\r\nsigned cheques were handed over to the Company. There was no plea of any fraud or\r\nmisrepresentation. It does, thus, appear that faced with the aforesaid position, the respondent only\r\nsought to take a technical plea arising from the format of the complaint to evade his liability. There\r\nwas no requirement of a loan agreement to be executed separately as any alternative nature of\r\ntransaction was never stated. Conclusion:\r\n28. We are, thus, of the view that both the impugned orders of the trial court and the High Court\r\ncannot be sustained and are required to be set aside. The finding is, thus, reached that the complaint\r\nwas properly instituted and the respondent failed to disclose why he did not meet the financial\r\nliability arising to a payee, who is a holder of a cheque in due course.\r\n29. We now turn to what would be the result of the aforesaid finding. The complaint was instituted\r\nin July, 2006. Fifteen (15) years have elapsed since then. The punishment prescribed for such an\r\noffence under Section 138 of the NI Act is imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years,\r\nor with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. We are of the view\r\nthat in the given scenario the respondent should be sentenced with imprisonment for a term of one\r\nyear and with fine twice the amount of the cheque, i.e., Rs.3,20,000\/-. However, in view of passage\r\nof time, we provide that if the respondent pays a further sum of Rs.1,60,000\/- to the appellant, then\r\nthe sentence would stand suspended. The needful be done by the respondent within two (2) months\r\nfrom today. The appellant would also be entitled to costs.\r\n30. The appeal accordingly stands allowed in the aforesaid terms.\r\n...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

          "judgement":"Surya Kant, J.\r\nThe instant Criminal Appeal emanates from the judgment and order dated 7th September 2009 of\r\nthe High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh, whereby the order dated 20 th March 2002\r\npassed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sonipat, convicting the Appellant\u2212Bijender @ Mandar\r\nunder Sections 392 and 397 IPC was affirmed. The High Court upheld the rigorous imprisonment of\r\n5 years along with fine of Rs.5000\/\u2212 for the offence punishable under Section 392 IPC. However, it\r\nreduced the sentence from 10 to 7 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10,000\/\u2212 for the\r\noffence punishable under Section 397 IPC. Both the sentences were directed to run concurrently.\r\nPage | 1 FACTS:\r\n2. Briefly put, the Prosecution version is that on 14 th April 1999, at around 11:00\r\nAM, Bal Kishan (Complainant) was on his way to Delhi on his motorcycle along with\r\nhis nephew, Sanjay, to purchase a plot of land and was carrying a sum of Rs.\r\n46,000\/\u2212 for the said purpose.\r\nWhen the Complainant reached near the farm house of one Virender Bansal, on Jatheri Road, he\r\nwas intercepted by a vehicle. The Appellant and one Manjeet (co\u2212accused) stepped out of the said\r\nvehicle, armed with country made pistols and asked the Complainant to hand over the amount. The\r\nComplainant then handed over the key of the bike. The Accused took out the bag containing the\r\nmoney from the boot of the motorcycle and fled from the spot. Whereafter, the Complainant rushed\r\ntowards the nearest Police Station on foot, leaving his nephew and the motorcycle behind, at the\r\nplace of the incidence. To the good fortune of the Complainant, on his way to the Police Station, he\r\nmet with ASI Rajinder Kumar (PW\u221214) and reported the occurrence to him. Consequently, an FIR\r\nwas lodged and the investigation was set in motion.\r\n3. Four accused persons, including the Appellant were arrested on the basis of secret information\r\nreceived by the police and they were charged under Sections 392, 397 and 120\u2212B IPC and Section 25\r\nof the Arms Act. Whilst the 5th co\u2212accused (Vinod) could not be arrested and Page | 2 was declared\r\na proclaimed offender under Section 82 Cr.P.C., the other Accused including the Appellant abjured\r\ntheir guilt and pleaded \u2018not guilty\u2019. In the eventual trial, 14 witnesses were examined by the\r\nProsecution. No evidence was led by the Defence. The Prosecution presented its narrative before the\r\nTrial Court that the Accused persons, along with Vinod, conspired together to loot the Complainant,\r\nwho, they were aware was carrying money for the purchase of a plot in Delhi. Whereas co\u2212accused\r\nMukesh and Subhash had provided the information, the Appellant, Manjeet and Vinod actually\r\ncarried out the robbery.\r\n4. The case of the Prosecution banked heavily on the disclosure statements made by the Accused\r\npersons and the pre\u2212trial recoveries made pursuant thereto. The Appellant in his revelation (Ex.\r\nPD) affirmed the chronicle presented by the Prosecution. He further stated that Rs. 10,000\/\u2212 fell in\r\nhis kitty as part of his share, out of which he had already spent Rs. 5,000\/. The Appellant led the\r\npolice to his residence and aided in recovering Rs. 5,000\/\u2212 which were found wrapped in a \u2018red\r\ncloth\u2019 (Ex. P1), along with a passbook (Ex. P2). It is alleged that the \u2018red cloth\u2019 belonged to the wife\r\nof the Complainant, with the name \u2018Kamla\u2019 embroidered on it and the passbook belonged to the\r\nComplainant. Similarly, the disclosure statements of the co\u2212 accused led to the recovery of some\r\npaltry amount and a country Page | 3 made pistol belonging to co\u2212accused Manjeet, which was\r\nallegedly used for commission of the crime. These incriminatory statements were in line with the\r\ndivulgation of the Appellant.\r\n5. During the trial, a host of Prosecution witnesses turned hostile. Even though the Complainant\r\n(PW\u22124), in his deposition, acknowledged that the \u2018red cloth\u2019 belonged to his wife but he refuted that\r\nthe pass book and\/or the said cloth was recovered from the possession of the Appellant in his\r\npresence. He further denied that the Accused, including the Appellant, matched the identity of the\r\npersons who committed the felony. He also denied that the recovery memo (Ex. PD\/2) bore his\r\nsignature. The Complainant\u2019s nephew, Sanjay (PW\u22126), who was an eye\u2212witness, also debunked the\r\nvery occurrence of the incident in its entirety and testified that no amount was snatched from his\r\nuncle, the Complainant. In a similar vein, PW\u22125 and PW\u22128, who were independent witnesses to the\r\nrecovery of the articles by the police and to the alleged conspiracy, respectively, also resiled and\r\nwere declared hostile.\r\n6. Only the formal witnesses supported the tale of the Prosecution and stood their ground qua the\r\nguilt of the Accused. In this regard, the testimony of ASI Rajinder Kumar (PW\u221214), who was in\u2212\r\ncharge of the investigation, bears some significance. This witness affirmed to the legitimacy of the\r\ndisclosure statements presented by all the Accused, Page | 4 including the Appellant, and stated that\r\nthe Complainant in his supplementary statement before the police had contended that Rs. 46,000\/\u2212\r\nwere wrapped in a \u2018red cloth\u2019 which had Complainant\u2019s wife\u2019s name embroidered on it along with a\r\nPassbook of Indian Bank. Albeit, ASI Rajinder Kumar in his cross\u2212examination, admitted that the\r\n\u2018red cloth\u2019 which was recovered from the house of the Appellant was easily available in the market\r\nand that the name \u2018Kamla\u2019 could also be easily engraved thereupon. Further, he also deposed that\r\nwhilst co\u2212accused Manjeet had sought for Test Identification Parade (for short, \u201CT.I.P.\u201D), the\r\nComplainant refused to participate in the same and instead had tendered an affidavit, claiming that\r\nif he were to identify Manjeet he would be killed. H.C. Karmbir Singh (PW\u221213), who was present\r\nwith PW\u221214 when the disclosure statements were tendered by the Accused, also supported the\r\nProsecution version and deposed that the recovery of the incriminating articles was made in his\r\npresence.\r\n7. The Appellant in his 313 Cr.P.C. statement denied the recovery of all the incriminating evidence\r\nput before him. To the same effect were the statements made by other co\u2212accused under Section 313\r\nCr.P.C., denying the Prosecution version completely.\r\n8. The Trial Court found strength in the contention of the Prosecution that the material witnesses\r\nhad substantially proved its version though with minor discrepancies. The Court further noted that\r\nPage | 5 an admission by an accused leading to the discovery of any fact could be used against them\r\nand that in the instant case, the Accused had failed to provide any explanation as to how they came\r\ninto possession of the articles, especially the \u2018red cloth\u2019 and the passbook, which were recovered\r\nfrom the custody of the Appellant. In light of the instant fact scenario, the Trial Court concluded that\r\nrecovery of the Articles was sufficient to draw the inference of culpability and to bring home the\r\nguilt of the Accused. Consequently, the Trial Court convicted the Appellant and Manjeet under\r\nSections 392 & 397 IPC. Manjeet was further convicted under Section 25 of the Indian Arms Act,\r\n1959. Accused Mukesh and Subhash were also convicted under Section 120B IPC. All the Accused\r\nwere sentenced with a maximum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of 10 years each under Section\r\n397 IPC and\/or Section 120B IPC.\r\n9. Discontented, the Accused preferred separate appeals before the High Court of Punjab and\r\nHaryana. Their primary contention was that none of the eye\u2212witnesses or the independent\r\nwitnesses supported the Prosecution case and that they could not be convicted solely on the basis of\r\ndisclosure statements. Upon re\u2212appraisal of evidence, the High Court was unimpressed by the plea\r\nraised on behalf of the Accused and concurred with the findings of the Trial Court and further noted\r\nthat due to enormous rise in instances of dacoity, the Page | 6 non\u2212identification of the accused in\r\nthe Court could not be construed as a material consideration where other evidence points towards\r\nthe commission of the crime. The High Court vide a common judgment maintained the conviction of\r\nthe Accused persons. Nonetheless, the High Court reduced the sentence under Section 397 IPC to\r\nrigorous imprisonment of 7 years so as to meet the ends of justice.\r\n10. The aggrieved Appellant is now before this Court. CONTENTIONS:\r\n11. We have heard learned counsel(s) for the Appellant and the Respondent\u2212State at a considerable\r\nlength and perused the record in\u2212 depth. The principal contention raised on behalf of the Appellant\r\nis that his conviction is based solely on the basis of the \u2018disclosure statement\u2019 and that there is no\r\nother cogent evidence to withstand his conviction under Sections 392 and 397 IPC. It was further\r\ncontended that during the pendency of the present appeal, this Court, in Criminal Appeal No. 1375\r\nof 2010 and Criminal Appeal No. 1328 of 2013 had already acquitted co\u2212accused Mukesh and\r\nSuresh with a finding that there was a lack of evidence to sustain their conviction under Section\r\n120B IPC.\r\n12. Learned State Counsel, on the other hand, reminded us of the limited scope of interference by\r\nthis Court in a case of concurrent finding of fact and canvassed that the conviction of the Appellant,\r\non Page | 7 the basis of his disclosure statement, which led to the recovery of Rs. 5,000\/\u2212 along with\r\nthe \u2018red cloth\u2019 and the Indian Bank passbook, was sufficient to foster the conviction of the Appellant.\r\nRegarding the acquittal of the co\u2212accused, it was rebutted that the allegations qua them pertained\r\nonly to the extent of conspiracy, and hence, their acquittal did not have any substantial impact on\r\nthe conviction of the Appellant herein, who is alleged to have actually carried out the malfeasance.\r\nANALYSIS:\r\n13. It may be accentuated at the outset that although this Court is bestowed with capacious powers\r\nunder Article 136 of the Constitution, yet, while beseeching such powers in a criminal appeal by\r\nspecial leave, this Court would by and large abstain from entering into a fresh re\u2212appraisement of\r\nevidence and doubt the credibility of witnesses when there is a concurrent finding of fact, save for\r\ncertain exceptional circumstances where the decision(s) under challenge are shown to have\r\ncommitted a manifest error of law or procedure or the conclusion reached is ex\u2212facie perverse.\r\n14. Adverting to the case at hand, indubitably, the only eye\u2212 witnesses to the alleged crime, i.e., the\r\nComplainant (PW\u22124) and his nephew (PW\u22126) have not supported the case of the Prosecution. The\r\nComplainant (PW\u22124) in his testimony before the Court unequivocally Page | 8 denied that the\r\nAppellant or his co\u2212accused were involved in the execution of the offence. Further, in the deposition\r\nof ASI Rajinder Kumar (PW\u221214), who was the investigating officer of the case, there is no mention\r\nof T.I.P. even attempted to be led, in so far as the Appellant is concerned. Ergo, the very identity of\r\nthe Appellant as one of the perpetrators stands obscured, particularly, considering that all the\r\naccused in the case were arrested on the basis of a secret information, the origin of which is\r\nnaturally unknown.\r\n15. The short question that falls for our consideration thus is whether the conviction of the Appellant\r\non the strength of the purported disclosure statement (Ex. PD) and the recovery memo (Ex. PD\/2),\r\nin the absence of any corroborative evidence, can sustain?\r\n16. We have implored ourselves with abounding pronouncements of this Court on this point. It may\r\nbe true that at times the Court can convict an accused exclusively on the basis of his disclosure\r\nstatement and the resultant recovery of inculpatory material. However, in order to sustain the guilt\r\nof such accused, the recovery should be unimpeachable and not be shrouded with elements of doubt.\r\n1 We may hasten to add that circumstances such as (i) the period of interval between the\r\nmalfeasance and the disclosure; (ii) commonality of the recovered object and its availability in the\r\nmarket; (iii) nature of the Vijay Thakur vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, (2014) 14 SCC 609 Page | 9\r\nobject and its relevance to the crime; (iv) ease of transferability of the object; (v) the testimony and\r\ntrustworthiness of the attesting witness before the Court and\/or other like factors, are weighty\r\nconsiderations that aid in gauging the intrinsic evidentiary value and credibility of the recovery.\r\n(See: Tulsiram Kanu vs. The State2; Pancho vs. State of Haryana3; State of Rajasthan vs. Talevar &\r\nAnr 4 and Bharama Parasram Kudhachkar vs. State of Karnataka5)\r\n17. Incontrovertibly, where the prosecution fails to inspire confidence in the manner and\/or\r\ncontents of the recovery with regard to its nexus to the alleged offence, the Court ought to stretch the\r\nbenefit of doubt to the accused. Its nearly three centuries old cardinal principle of criminal\r\njurisprudence that \u201Cit is better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer\u201D. The\r\ndoctrine of extending benefit of doubt to an accused, notwithstanding the proof of a strong\r\nsuspicion, holds its fort on the premise that \u201Cthe acquittal of a guilty person constitutes a\r\nmiscarriage of justice just as much as the conviction of the innocent\u201D.\r\n18. It may not be wise or prudent to convict a person only because there is rampant increase in\r\nheinous crimes and victims are oftenly AIR 1954 SC 1 (2011) 10 SCC 165.\r\n(2011) 11 SCC 666 (2014) 14 SCC 431 Page | 10 reluctant to speak truth due to fear or other\r\nextraneous reasons. The burden to prove the guilt beyond doubt does not shift on the suspect save\r\nwhere the law casts duty on the accused to prove his\/her innocence. It is the bounden duty of the\r\nprosecution in cases where material witnesses are likely to be slippery, either to get their statements\r\nrecorded at the earliest under Section 164 Cr.P.C. or collect such other cogent evidence that its case\r\ndoes not entirely depend upon oral testimonies.\r\n19. Unmindful of these age\u2212old parameters, we find that the Prosecution in the present case has\r\nmiserably failed to bring home the guilt of the Appellant and Courts below have been unwittingly\r\nswayed by irrelevant considerations, such as the rise in the incidents of dacoity. In its desire to hold\r\na heavy hand over such derelictions, the Trial Court and the High Court have hastened to shift the\r\nburden on the Appellant to elucidate how he bechanced to be in possession of the incriminating\r\narticles, without primarily scrutinizing the credibility and admissibility of the recovery as well as its\r\nlinkage to the misconduct. We say so for the following reasons:\r\nFirstly, the High Court and the Trial Court failed to take into consideration that the\r\ntestimony of ASI Rajinder Kumar (PW\u221214) exhibited no substantial effort made by\r\nthe police for conducting the search of the residence of the Appellant in the presence\r\nof local Page | 11 witnesses. The only independent witness to the recovery was Raldu\r\n(PW\u22128) who was admittedly a companion of the Complainant. Secondly, the\r\nComplainant (PW\u22124) as well as Raldu (PW\u22128), have unambiguously refuted that\r\nneither the passbook, nor the \u2018red cloth\u2019 was recovered from the possession of the\r\nAppellant, as claimed in his disclosure statement.\r\nThirdly, while the Complainant (PW\u22124) negated his signatures on the recovery memo\r\n(EX. PD\/2), on the other hand, Raldu (PW\u22128) also neither enumerated the recovery\r\nmemo (Ex. PD\/2) in the catalogue of exhibited documents, nor did that he affirm to\r\nhaving his endorsement.\r\nFourthly, the recovered articles are common place objects such as money which can\r\nbe easily transferred from one hand to another and the \u2018red cloth\u2019 with \u2018Kamla\u2019\r\nembossed on it, as has been acceded by the Investigating Officer, Rajinder Kumar\r\n(PW\u221214), can also be easily available in market.\r\nFifthly, the recovery took place nearly a month after the commission of the alleged\r\noffence. We find it incredulous, that the Appellant during the entire time period kept\r\nboth the red cloth and the passbook in his custody, along with the money he allegedly\r\nrobbed off the Complainant.\r\nPage | 12 Sixthly and finally, there is no other evidence on record which even\r\nremotely points towards the iniquity of the Appellant.\r\n20. It appears to us that the Trial Court and the High Court have erroneously drawn adverse\r\ninference against the Appellant, in spite of the Prosecution having lamentably failed to adequately\r\ndispense with its burden of proof to depict culpability of the Appellant. As far as the view of the Trial\r\nCourt and the High Court qua the alleged threat is concerned, we find it hard\u2212pressed to give\r\ncredence to such allegations in the absence of any compelling evidence to substantiate the same.\r\nAlthough, the Prosecution has attempted to place reliance on the affidavit presented by the\r\nComplainant during the T.I.P. offered by the co\u2212accused\u2212Manjeet, we find that the said affidavit\r\ndoes not name the Appellant herein and pertains solely to Manjeet.\r\n21. In light of the afore\u2212stated discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the evidence on\r\nrecord does not establish the guilt of the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt and the Courts below\r\nhave arrived at recording the guilt of the Appellant in absence of any cogent rationale, justifying his\r\nconviction.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n22. Consequently, and as a sequel thereto, the criminal appeal is allowed. The judgments and orders\r\npassed by the Trial Court and Page | 13 High Court are set\u2212aside and the Appellant is acquitted of all\r\ncharges. Bail bond, if any, stands discharged.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. CJI.\r\n(N.V.

          "judgement":"R. Subhash Reddy, J.\r\n1. This civil appeal is filed by the appellant in Writ Appeal No.361 of 2008 on the file of Gauhati\r\nHigh Court, aggrieved by the order dated 03.04.2009. By the aforesaid order, the order dated\r\n08.06.2007 passed by the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition No.219 of 2006 was confirmed. The\r\nlearned Single Judge, while confirming the order of compulsory retirement in disciplinary\r\nproceedings initiated against the appellant, has held Date: 2021.02.08 17:10:24 IST Reason:\r\nthat withholding of service benefits as well as pensionary dues to the appellant is\r\nillegal and issued directions to pay the retiral benefits.\r\n2. The appellant was the Manager of the first respondent\u2212 bank. On the basis of certain allegations\r\nlevelled against him, disciplinary proceedings were initiated and charge memo dated 18.06.2004\r\nwas issued. The substance of the charges is extracted in the order passed by the learned Single\r\nJudge. In view of the reply filed by him on 15.07.2004, denying the charges, the respondent\u2212bank\r\nhaving not satisfied with the explanation, has decided to order departmental enquiry against the\r\nappellant. The Enquiry Officer, after completing the enquiry by appreciating the oral and\r\ndocumentary evidence on record, has held that all the charges, i.e. charge nos.1 to 5, framed against\r\nthe appellant were proved. In view of the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer, the respondent\u2212\r\nbank has proposed to inflict the punishment of compulsory retirement on the appellant. Based on\r\nthe findings recorded in the departmental enquiry, has passed order imposing the punishment of\r\n\u201Ccompulsory retirement\u201D from service. The appellant was unsuccessful before the departmental\r\nappellate authority, i.e., Board of Directors of the Bank and the appellate authority has dismissed his\r\nappeal confirming the order of the disciplinary authority. Challenging the order of the disciplinary\r\nauthority imposing the punishment of compulsory retirement, as confirmed by the appellate\r\nauthority, the appellant approached the High Court by filing Writ Petition (C) No.219 of 2006 before\r\nthe Gauhati High Court. The learned Single Judge vide detailed judgment and order dated\r\n08.06.2007 has not interfered with the order of compulsory retirement but at the same time has\r\nfound that withholding of the service benefits including pensionary dues was illegal and issued\r\ndirections for payment of such benefits to the appellant. As against the order of the learned Single\r\nJudge, the appellant has preferred Writ Appeal No.361 of 2008. The Division Bench of the High\r\nCourt, by the impugned order, has dismissed the same by confirming the order of the learned Single\r\nJudge.\r\n3. We have heard Sri Parthiv Goswami, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri Rajesh Kumar,\r\nlearned counsel appearing for the respondent\u2212bank.\r\n4. Learned counsel for the appellant has mainly contended that after completion of enquiry, even\r\nbefore furnishing a copy of enquiry report, the disciplinary authority has issued show cause notice\r\ndated 30.07.2005 vide Ref.\r\nNo.LBG\/I&V\/PP&PA\/154\/08\/2005\u221206 by indicating proposed punishment of compulsory\r\nretirement. It is submitted that such conclusion arrived at by the disciplinary authority even before\r\nthe service of enquiry report, is illegal. To buttress his submission, the learned counsel has placed\r\nreliance on judgment of this Court in the case of Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad & Ors. v. B.\r\nKarunakar & Ors. (1993) 4 SCC 727 and the judgment of this Court in the case of State Bank of India\r\n& Ors. v. Mohammad Badruddin (2019) 16 SCC 69. Further submission of the learned counsel was\r\nthat the disciplinary authority has not recorded any reasons in the order dated 29.08.2005 while\r\nimposing the punishment of compulsory retirement and similarly the appellate authority has\r\ndismissed the appeal without recording reasons. Lastly, it is submitted by learned counsel that the\r\npunishment imposed is disproportionate to the gravity of charges, as such, prayed for setting aside\r\nthe impugned orders.\r\n5. On the other hand, Sri Rajesh Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent\u2212bank, by\r\ntaking us to the charges framed against the appellant and the findings recorded by the Enquiry\r\nOfficer, has submitted that the charges framed against the appellant are grave and serious and in\r\nview of the proved misconduct of the appellant who was working as a Manager in the bank, the\r\norder of compulsory retirement was passed by the disciplinary authority. It is submitted that having\r\nregard to charges framed against the appellant, punishment imposed cannot be said to be\r\ndisproportionate. Further it is submitted that after enquiry is completed it is always open for the\r\ndisciplinary authority to indicate the punishment in the show cause notice, by enclosing a copy of\r\nthe Enquiry Report. It is submitted that the respondents have followed procedure contemplated\r\nunder the Rules and the procedure adopted is in conformity with the ratio laid down by this Court in\r\nthe case of Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad (supra). It is submitted that having regard to facts\r\nof the case, the judgment in the case of Mohammad Badruddin (supra) has no application to\r\nsupport the case of the appellant.\r\n6. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we have perused the impugned order, the order\r\nof the learned Single Judge and other material placed on record.\r\n7. The appellant was working as a Manager of the respondent\u2212bank. A perusal of the charges, which\r\nare held to be proved by the Enquiry Officer, reveal that he has sanctioned and disbursed loans\r\nwithout following the due procedure contemplated under law and also there are allegations of\r\nmisappropriation, disbursing loans irregularly in some instances to (a) units without any\r\nshop\/business; (b) more than one loan to members of same family etc. The Enquiry Officer, after\r\nconsidering oral and documentary evidence on record, has held that all the charges are proved.\r\nBased on the findings recorded by Enquiry Officer, the disciplinary authority has tentatively decided\r\nto impose punishment of compulsory retirement. Disciplinary authority has issued show cause\r\nnotice dated 30.07.2005 by enclosing a copy of the enquiry report. In response to the show cause\r\nnotice, the appellant has submitted his comments vide letter dated 16.08.2005 indicating that due\r\nto work pressure some operational lapses have occurred. Further he has also pleaded that if the\r\nbank has sustained any loss due to his fault, he is ready to bear such loss from his own source. After\r\nfiling the response to the show cause notice, order is passed by disciplinary authority imposing\r\npunishment of compulsory retirement. After Enquiry Officer records his findings, it is always open\r\nfor the disciplinary authority to arrive at tentative conclusion of proposed punishment and it can\r\nindicate to the delinquent employee by enclosing a copy of the enquiry report. Though the learned\r\ncounsel for the appellant has argued that even before tentative conclusion is arrived at by the\r\ndisciplinary authority, the enquiry report has to be served upon him, but there is no such\r\nproposition laid down in the judgment of this Court in the case of Managing Director, ECIL,\r\nHyderabad (supra). In the aforesaid judgment of this Court it is held that delinquent employee is\r\nentitled to a copy of the enquiry report of the enquiry officer before the disciplinary authority takes a\r\ndecision on the question of guilt of the delinquent. Merely because a show cause notice is issued by\r\nindicating the proposed punishment it cannot be said that disciplinary authority has taken a\r\ndecision. A perusal of the show cause notice dated 30.07.2005 itself makes it clear that along with\r\nthe show cause notice itself enquiry report was also enclosed. As such, it cannot be said that the\r\nprocedure prescribed under the rules was not followed by respondent\u2212bank. We are of the view that\r\nthe judgment of this Court in the case of Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad (supra) is not helpful\r\nto the case of the appellant. Further, it is well settled that if the disciplinary authority accepts the\r\nfindings recorded by the Enquiry Officer and passes an order, no detailed reasons are required to be\r\nrecorded in the order imposing punishment. The punishment is imposed based on the findings\r\nrecorded in the enquiry report, as such, no further elaborate reasons are required to be given by the\r\ndisciplinary authority. As the departmental appeal was considered by the Board of Directors in the\r\nmeeting held on 10.12.2005, the Board\u2019s decision is communicated vide order dated 21.12.2005 in\r\nRef. No.LGB\/I&V\/Appeal\/31\/02\/2005\u221206. In that view of the matter, we do not find any merit in\r\nthe submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that orders impugned are devoid of reasons.\r\n8. Even, the last submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the punishment imposed is\r\ndisproportionate to the gravity of charges, also cannot be accepted. The charges framed against the\r\nappellant in the departmental enquiry are serious and grave. If we look at the response, in his letter\r\ndated 16.08.2005, to the show cause notice issued by the disciplinary authority, it is clear that he\r\nhas virtually admitted the charges, however, tried to explain that such lapses occurred due to work\r\npressure. Further he went to the extent of saying \u2013 he is ready to bear the loss suffered by the bank\r\non account of his lapses. The manager of a bank plays a vital role in managing the affairs of the\r\nbank. A bank officer\/employee deals with the public money. The nature of his work demands\r\nvigilance with the in\u2212built requirement to act carefully. If an officer\/employee of the bank is allowed\r\nto act beyond his authority, the discipline of the bank will disappear. When the procedural\r\nguidelines are issued for grant of loans, officers\/employees are required to follow the same\r\nmeticulously and any deviation will lead to erosion of public trust on the banks. If the manager of a\r\nbank indulges in such misconduct, which is evident from the charge memo dated 18.06.2004 and\r\nthe findings of the enquiry officer, it indicates that such charges are grave and serious. Inspite of\r\nproved misconduct on such serious charges, disciplinary authority itself was liberal in imposing the\r\npunishment of compulsory retirement. In that view of the matter, it cannot be said that the\r\npunishment imposed in the disciplinary proceedings on the appellant, is disproportionate to the\r\ngravity of charges. As such, this submission of the learned counsel for the appellant also cannot be\r\naccepted.\r\n9. For the aforesaid reasons, this appeal is devoid of merit, same is dismissed with no order as to\r\ncosts.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

I knew the accused Major Singh since\r\nlong. Remaining three accused were apprehended at the spot. Accused Boota Singh,\r\nGurdeep Singh and Gurmahender Singh alias Mitta were found sitting upon two bags\r\nlying in the said Jeep. Thereafter, I served notices Ex.PC, Ex.PD and Ex.PE upon\r\naccused Gurdeep, Boota and Gurmahender Singh respectively u\/s 50 of NDPS asking\r\nthem as to whether they desired their search before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate.\r\nVide replies Exl.PC\/1.1, Ex.PDA and Ex.PE\/I, accused Gurdeep Singh, Boota Singh\r\nand Gurmahender Singh alias Mitta declined the offer and reposed faith in the police.\r\n\u2026\u201D In his cross-examination, the witness stated:-\r\n\u201CI did not record the secret information in writing. Wireless in my jeep was out of\r\norder at that time. I did not obtain any search warrants for conducting the search of\r\nthe jeep of accused during night hours. I did not record any ground for not obtaining\r\nthe requisite search warrants in my police file. The writing work was done while\r\nsitting in the jeep.\u201D\r\n5. After considering the evidence on record, the Trial Court by its judgment and order dated\r\n12.08.2004, acquitted accused Major Singh but convicted accused Boota Singh, Gurdeep Singh and\r\nGurmohinder Singh, under Section 15 of the NDPS Act and sentenced them to suffer rigorous\r\nimprisonment for 10 years with imposition of fine in the sum of Rs.1,00,000\/-, in default whereof\r\nthey were directed to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years.\r\nOn the question of applicability of Section 42 of the NDPS Act, the Trial Court stated:-\r\n\u201C \u2026 Learned counsel sought acquittal of accused due to non- compliance of Section 42\r\nof N.D.P.S. Act. However, above said argument could help the accused if recovery had\r\nbeen effected from the house, building etc. of the accused. Admittedly, recovery in\r\nquestion was effected from the accused while they were sitting on road in a jeep at a\r\npublic place. Therefore, case of accused would be covered by Section 43 of N.D.P.S.\r\nAct and not by Section 42 of N.D.P.S. Act. Under these circumstances, argument of\r\nlearned counsels for accused is overruled.\u201D\r\n6. The convicted accused, being aggrieved, preferred the aforementioned Criminal Appeal before the\r\nHigh Court, which was dismissed by the High Court.\r\nOn the question whether the matter came within the scope of Section 42 of the NDPS Act, the High\r\nCourt observed:-\r\n14. Furthermore, in the case in hand, the accused were present in a jeep on a public\r\npath and in such circumstance, the provisions of Section 43 and not of 42 of the Act\r\ncome into play. As per explanation to Section 43 of the Act, the public place includes\r\na conveyance also. Section 43 of the Act contemplates a seizure made in a public\r\nplace or in transit. As such, Section 42 of the Act is not applicable to the facts of the\r\npresent case \u2026\u201D\r\n7. In this appeal preferred by Boota Singh, Gurdeep Singh and Gurmohinder Singh challenging the\r\ncorrectness of the decisions of the courts below, we heard Mr. Praveen Kumar, learned counsel for\r\nthe appellants and Mr. Rakesh Mudgal, learned AAG for the State.\r\n8. Mr. Praveen Kumar submitted inter alia:\r\na. The vehicle in question was a private vehicle belonging to accused Gurdeep Singh\r\nand was not a public conveyance, though parked on a public road.\r\nb. As accepted by PW4 Inspector Nand Lal, the secret information was not recorded\r\nin writing nor any grounds were recorded for not obtaining the requisite search\r\nwarrants.\r\nc. The instant case would not be come under Section 43 but would be governed by the\r\nprovisions of Section 42 of the NDPS Act.\r\nd. Section 42 having not been complied with at all, the appellants were entitled to\r\nacquittal in terms of law laid down in the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in\r\nKarnail Singh v. State of Haryana1, followed in subsequent decisions in Sukhdev\r\nSingh v. State of Haryana2, and, State of Rajasthan v. Jagraj Singh alias Hansa3.\r\n1(2009) 8 SCC 539 2(2013) 2 SCC 212 3(2016) 11 SCC 687\r\n9. Countering the submissions, Mr. Rakesh Mudgal, learned AAG submitted that the courts below\r\nwere right in observing that the instant case would be governed by the provisions of Section 43 of\r\nthe NDPS Act. It was however accepted by the learned counsel that there was no material on record\r\nto conclude that the vehicle in question was a public conveyance.\r\n10. In Karnail Singh , the Constitution Bench of this Court concluded:-\r\n\u201C35. In conclusion, what is to be noticed is that Abdul Rashid [(2000) 2 SCC 513 :\r\n2000 SCC (Cri) 496] did not require literal compliance with the requirements of\r\nSections 42(1) and 42(2) nor did Sajan Abraham [(2001) 6 SCC 692 :\r\n2001 SCC (Cri) 1217] hold that the requirements of Sections 42(1) and 42(2) need not\r\nbe fulfilled at all. The effect of the two decisions was as follows:\r\n(a) The officer on receiving the information [of the nature referred to in sub-section\r\n(1) of Section 42] from any person had to record it in writing in the register\r\nconcerned and forthwith send a copy to his immediate official superior, before\r\nproceeding to take action in terms of clauses (a) to\r\n(d) of Section 42(1).\r\n(b) But if the information was received when the officer was not in the police station,\r\nbut while he was on the move either on patrol duty or otherwise, either by mobile\r\nphone, or other means, and the information calls for immediate action and any delay\r\nwould have resulted in the goods or evidence being removed or destroyed, it would\r\nnot be feasible or practical to take down in writing the information given to him, in\r\nsuch a situation, he could take action as per clauses (a) to (d) of Section 42(1) and\r\nthereafter, as soon as it is practical, record the information in writing and forthwith\r\ninform the same to the official superior.\r\n(c) In other words, the compliance with the requirements of Sections 42(1) and 42(2)\r\nin regard to writing down the information received and sending a copy thereof to the\r\nsuperior officer, should normally precede the entry, search and seizure by the officer.\r\nBut in special circumstances involving emergent situations, the recording of the\r\ninformation in writing and sending a copy thereof to the official superior may get\r\npostponed by a reasonable period, that is, after the search, entry and seizure. The\r\nquestion is one of urgency and expediency.\r\n(d) While total non-compliance with requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of Section 42 is impermissible, delayed compliance with satisfactory explanation\r\nabout the delay will be acceptable compliance with Section 42. To illustrate, if any delay may result\r\nin the accused escaping or the goods or evidence being destroyed or removed, not recording in\r\nwriting the information received, before initiating action, or non-sending of a copy of such\r\ninformation to the official superior forthwith, may not be treated as violation of Section\r\n42. But if the information was received when the police officer was in the police station with\r\nsufficient time to take action, and if the police officer fails to record in writing the information\r\nreceived, or fails to send a copy thereof, to the official superior, then it will be a suspicious\r\ncircumstance being a clear violation of Section 42 of the Act. Similarly, where the police officer does\r\nnot record the information at all, and does not inform the official superior at all, then also it will be a\r\nclear violation of Section 42 of the Act. Whether there is adequate or substantial compliance with\r\nSection 42 or not is a question of fact to be decided in each case. The above position got\r\nstrengthened with the amendment to Section 42 by Act 9 of 2001.\u201D (Emphasis added)\r\n11. In Jagraj Singh alias Hansa , the facts were more or less identical.\r\nIn that case, the vehicle (as observed in para 5.3 of the decision) was not a public transport vehicle.\r\nAfter considering the relevant provisions and some of the decisions of this Court including the\r\ndecision in Karnail Singh , it was observed:-\r\n\u201C14. What Section 42(2) requires is that where an officer takes down an information\r\nin writing under sub-section (1) he shall send a copy thereof to his immediate officer\r\nsenior. The communication Ext. P-15 which was sent to the Circle Officer, Nohar was\r\nnot as per the information recorded in Ext. P-14 and Ext. P-21. Thus, no error was\r\ncommitted by the High Court in coming to the conclusion that there was breach of\r\nSection 42(2).\r\n16. In this context, it is relevant to note that before the Special Judge also the breach\r\nof Sections 42(1) and 42(2) was contended on behalf of the defence. In para 12 of the\r\njudgment the Special Judge noted the above arguments of defence.\r\n14. The decision of this Court in Karnail Singh as followed in Jagraj Singh alias Hansa , is absolutely\r\nclear. Total non-compliance of Section 42 is impermissible. The rigor of Section 42 may get lessened\r\nin situations dealt with in the conclusion drawn by this Court in Karnail Singh but in no case, total\r\nnon-compliance of Section 42 can be accepted.\r\n15. In the circumstances, the courts below fell in error in rejecting the submissions advanced on\r\nbehalf of the appellants. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set-aside the view taken by the High Court\r\nand acquit the appellants of the charge levelled against them. The appellants be released forthwith\r\nunless their custody is required in connection with any other offence.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..J. [Uday Umesh Lalit] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..J. [K.M. Joseph] New Delhi;\r\nApril 16, 2021.\r\n\r\nHowever, the arguments based on non-compliance with Section 42(2) were brushed aside by\r\nobserving that discrepancy in Ext. P-14 and Ext. P-15 is totally due to clerical mistake and there was\r\ncompliance with Section 42(2). The Special Judge coming to compliance with the proviso to Section\r\n42(1) held that the vehicle searched was being used to transport passengers as has been clearly\r\nstated by its owner Vira Ram, hence, as per the Explanation to Section 43 of the Act, the vehicle was\r\na public transport vehicle and there was no need of any warrant or authority to search such a\r\nvehicle. The High Court has reversed the above findings of the Special Judge. We thus, proceed to\r\nexamine as to whether Section 43 was attracted in the present case which obviated the requirement\r\nof Section 42(1) proviso.\r\n ..... .....\r\n .....\r\n29. After referring to the earlier judgments, the Constitution Bench came to the conclusion that\r\nnon-compliance with requirement of Sections 42 and 50 is impermissible whereas delayed\r\ncompliance with satisfactory explanation will be acceptable compliance with Section 42. The\r\nConstitution Bench noted the effect of the aforesaid two decisions in para 5. The present is not a\r\ncase where insofar as compliance with Section 42(1) proviso even an argument based on substantial\r\ncompliance is raised there is total non-compliance with Section 42(1) proviso. As observed above,\r\nSection 43 being not attracted, search was to be conducted after complying with the provisions of\r\nSection 42. We thus, conclude that the High Court has rightly held that non-compliance with\r\nSection 42(1) and Section 42(2) were proved on the record and the High Court has not committed\r\nany error in setting aside the conviction order.\u201D (Emphasis added)\r\n12. The evidence in the present case clearly shows that the vehicle was not a public conveyance but\r\nwas a vehicle belonging to accused Gurdeep Singh. The Registration Certificate of the vehicle, which\r\nhas been placed on record also does not indicate it to be a Public Transport Vehicle. The explanation\r\nto Section 43 shows that a private vehicle would not come within the expression \u201Cpublic place\u201D as\r\nexplained in Section 43 of the NDPS Act. On the strength of the decision of this Court in Jagraj\r\nSingh alias Hansa , the relevant provision would not be Section 43 of the NDPS Act but the case\r\nwould come under Section 42 of the NDPS Act.\r\n13. It is an admitted position that there was total non-compliance of the requirements of Section 42\r\nof the NDPS Act.\r\n",

          "judgement":"R. Subhash Reddy, J.\r\n1. This civil appeal is filed by the appellant in Writ Appeal No.361 of 2008 on the file of Gauhati\r\nHigh Court, aggrieved by the order dated 03.04.2009. By the aforesaid order, the order dated\r\n08.06.2007 passed by the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition No.219 of 2006 was confirmed. The\r\nlearned Single Judge, while confirming the order of compulsory retirement in disciplinary\r\nproceedings initiated against the appellant, has held Date: 2021.02.08 17:10:24 IST Reason:\r\nthat withholding of service benefits as well as pensionary dues to the appellant is\r\nillegal and issued directions to pay the retiral benefits.\r\n2. The appellant was the Manager of the first respondent\u2212 bank. On the basis of certain allegations\r\nlevelled against him, disciplinary proceedings were initiated and charge memo dated 18.06.2004\r\nwas issued. The substance of the charges is extracted in the order passed by the learned Single\r\nJudge. In view of the reply filed by him on 15.07.2004, denying the charges, the respondent\u2212bank\r\nhaving not satisfied with the explanation, has decided to order departmental enquiry against the\r\nappellant. The Enquiry Officer, after completing the enquiry by appreciating the oral and\r\ndocumentary evidence on record, has held that all the charges, i.e. charge nos.1 to 5, framed against\r\nthe appellant were proved. In view of the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer, the respondent\u2212\r\nbank has proposed to inflict the punishment of compulsory retirement on the appellant. Based on\r\nthe findings recorded in the departmental enquiry, has passed order imposing the punishment of\r\n\u201Ccompulsory retirement\u201D from service. The appellant was unsuccessful before the departmental\r\nappellate authority, i.e., Board of Directors of the Bank and the appellate authority has dismissed his\r\nappeal confirming the order of the disciplinary authority. Challenging the order of the disciplinary\r\nauthority imposing the punishment of compulsory retirement, as confirmed by the appellate\r\nauthority, the appellant approached the High Court by filing Writ Petition (C) No.219 of 2006 before\r\nthe Gauhati High Court. The learned Single Judge vide detailed judgment and order dated\r\n08.06.2007 has not interfered with the order of compulsory retirement but at the same time has\r\nfound that withholding of the service benefits including pensionary dues was illegal and issued\r\ndirections for payment of such benefits to the appellant. As against the order of the learned Single\r\nJudge, the appellant has preferred Writ Appeal No.361 of 2008. The Division Bench of the High\r\nCourt, by the impugned order, has dismissed the same by confirming the order of the learned Single\r\nJudge.\r\n3. We have heard Sri Parthiv Goswami, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri Rajesh Kumar,\r\nlearned counsel appearing for the respondent\u2212bank.\r\n4. Learned counsel for the appellant has mainly contended that after completion of enquiry, even\r\nbefore furnishing a copy of enquiry report, the disciplinary authority has issued show cause notice\r\ndated 30.07.2005 vide Ref.\r\nNo.LBG\/I&V\/PP&PA\/154\/08\/2005\u221206 by indicating proposed punishment of compulsory\r\nretirement. It is submitted that such conclusion arrived at by the disciplinary authority even before\r\nthe service of enquiry report, is illegal. To buttress his submission, the learned counsel has placed\r\nreliance on judgment of this Court in the case of Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad & Ors. v. B.\r\nKarunakar & Ors. (1993) 4 SCC 727 and the judgment of this Court in the case of State Bank of India\r\n& Ors. v. Mohammad Badruddin (2019) 16 SCC 69. Further submission of the learned counsel was\r\nthat the disciplinary authority has not recorded any reasons in the order dated 29.08.2005 while\r\nimposing the punishment of compulsory retirement and similarly the appellate authority has\r\ndismissed the appeal without recording reasons. Lastly, it is submitted by learned counsel that the\r\npunishment imposed is disproportionate to the gravity of charges, as such, prayed for setting aside\r\nthe impugned orders.\r\n5. On the other hand, Sri Rajesh Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent\u2212bank, by\r\ntaking us to the charges framed against the appellant and the findings recorded by the Enquiry\r\nOfficer, has submitted that the charges framed against the appellant are grave and serious and in\r\nview of the proved misconduct of the appellant who was working as a Manager in the bank, the\r\norder of compulsory retirement was passed by the disciplinary authority. It is submitted that having\r\nregard to charges framed against the appellant, punishment imposed cannot be said to be\r\ndisproportionate. Further it is submitted that after enquiry is completed it is always open for the\r\ndisciplinary authority to indicate the punishment in the show cause notice, by enclosing a copy of\r\nthe Enquiry Report. It is submitted that the respondents have followed procedure contemplated\r\nunder the Rules and the procedure adopted is in conformity with the ratio laid down by this Court in\r\nthe case of Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad (supra). It is submitted that having regard to facts\r\nof the case, the judgment in the case of Mohammad Badruddin (supra) has no application to\r\nsupport the case of the appellant.\r\n6. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we have perused the impugned order, the order\r\nof the learned Single Judge and other material placed on record.\r\n7. The appellant was working as a Manager of the respondent\u2212bank. A perusal of the charges, which\r\nare held to be proved by the Enquiry Officer, reveal that he has sanctioned and disbursed loans\r\nwithout following the due procedure contemplated under law and also there are allegations of\r\nmisappropriation, disbursing loans irregularly in some instances to (a) units without any\r\nshop\/business; (b) more than one loan to members of same family etc. The Enquiry Officer, after\r\nconsidering oral and documentary evidence on record, has held that all the charges are proved.\r\nBased on the findings recorded by Enquiry Officer, the disciplinary authority has tentatively decided\r\nto impose punishment of compulsory retirement. Disciplinary authority has issued show cause\r\nnotice dated 30.07.2005 by enclosing a copy of the enquiry report. In response to the show cause\r\nnotice, the appellant has submitted his comments vide letter dated 16.08.2005 indicating that due\r\nto work pressure some operational lapses have occurred. Further he has also pleaded that if the\r\nbank has sustained any loss due to his fault, he is ready to bear such loss from his own source. After\r\nfiling the response to the show cause notice, order is passed by disciplinary authority imposing\r\npunishment of compulsory retirement. After Enquiry Officer records his findings, it is always open\r\nfor the disciplinary authority to arrive at tentative conclusion of proposed punishment and it can\r\nindicate to the delinquent employee by enclosing a copy of the enquiry report. Though the learned\r\ncounsel for the appellant has argued that even before tentative conclusion is arrived at by the\r\ndisciplinary authority, the enquiry report has to be served upon him, but there is no such\r\nproposition laid down in the judgment of this Court in the case of Managing Director, ECIL,\r\nHyderabad (supra). In the aforesaid judgment of this Court it is held that delinquent employee is\r\nentitled to a copy of the enquiry report of the enquiry officer before the disciplinary authority takes a\r\ndecision on the question of guilt of the delinquent. Merely because a show cause notice is issued by\r\nindicating the proposed punishment it cannot be said that disciplinary authority has taken a\r\ndecision. A perusal of the show cause notice dated 30.07.2005 itself makes it clear that along with\r\nthe show cause notice itself enquiry report was also enclosed. As such, it cannot be said that the\r\nprocedure prescribed under the rules was not followed by respondent\u2212bank. We are of the view that\r\nthe judgment of this Court in the case of Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad (supra) is not helpful\r\nto the case of the appellant. Further, it is well settled that if the disciplinary authority accepts the\r\nfindings recorded by the Enquiry Officer and passes an order, no detailed reasons are required to be\r\nrecorded in the order imposing punishment. The punishment is imposed based on the findings\r\nrecorded in the enquiry report, as such, no further elaborate reasons are required to be given by the\r\ndisciplinary authority. As the departmental appeal was considered by the Board of Directors in the\r\nmeeting held on 10.12.2005, the Board\u2019s decision is communicated vide order dated 21.12.2005 in\r\nRef. No.LGB\/I&V\/Appeal\/31\/02\/2005\u221206. In that view of the matter, we do not find any merit in\r\nthe submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that orders impugned are devoid of reasons.\r\n8. Even, the last submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the punishment imposed is\r\ndisproportionate to the gravity of charges, also cannot be accepted. The charges framed against the\r\nappellant in the departmental enquiry are serious and grave. If we look at the response, in his letter\r\ndated 16.08.2005, to the show cause notice issued by the disciplinary authority, it is clear that he\r\nhas virtually admitted the charges, however, tried to explain that such lapses occurred due to work\r\npressure. Further he went to the extent of saying \u2013 he is ready to bear the loss suffered by the bank\r\non account of his lapses. The manager of a bank plays a vital role in managing the affairs of the\r\nbank. A bank officer\/employee deals with the public money. The nature of his work demands\r\nvigilance with the in\u2212built requirement to act carefully. If an officer\/employee of the bank is allowed\r\nto act beyond his authority, the discipline of the bank will disappear. When the procedural\r\nguidelines are issued for grant of loans, officers\/employees are required to follow the same\r\nmeticulously and any deviation will lead to erosion of public trust on the banks. If the manager of a\r\nbank indulges in such misconduct, which is evident from the charge memo dated 18.06.2004 and\r\nthe findings of the enquiry officer, it indicates that such charges are grave and serious. Inspite of\r\nproved misconduct on such serious charges, disciplinary authority itself was liberal in imposing the\r\npunishment of compulsory retirement. In that view of the matter, it cannot be said that the\r\npunishment imposed in the disciplinary proceedings on the appellant, is disproportionate to the\r\ngravity of charges. As such, this submission of the learned counsel for the appellant also cannot be\r\naccepted.\r\n9. For the aforesaid reasons, this appeal is devoid of merit, same is dismissed with no order as to\r\ncosts.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

The present appeals are directed against an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes\r\nRedressal Commission 1 on 06.01.2010 against the appellants i.e., Bombay Hospital & Medical\r\nResearch Centre2 and Dr. C. Anand Somaya3, directing to pay a sum of Rs. 14,18,491\/- along with\r\ninterest @ 9% p.a. from the date of filing of the complaint till the date of payment.\r\n1 For short, the \u2018Commission\u2019 2 For short, the \u2018Hospital\u2019 3 For short, the \u2018Doctor\u2019\r\n2. The complaint was filed before the Commission by the legal heirs 4 of the deceased - patient\r\nDinesh Jaiswal5, alleging medical negligence on the part of the Hospital and the Doctor in treating\r\nthe patient. The patient was admitted to the Hospital on 22.04.1998 and breathed his last on\r\n12.06.1998. The Hospital charged a sum of Rs. 4,08,800\/- for the treatment of the patient during\r\nthe period of his admission in the Hospital. The said amount is included in and is part of the amount\r\nof compensation awarded against the appellants herein.\r\n3. The patient was taking treatment since 1990 for having difficulties in walking due to the pain and\r\ndiscomfort in legs. For his complaint of inability to walk, a Colour Doppler Test was conducted on\r\n13.04.1998 at Khemuka X-Ray & Ultrasound Clinic, Nagpur which detected the following:\r\n\u201CAneurismal dilatation of the lower abdominal aorta just above bifurcation is seen.\r\nThe aneurism measures 5.4 x 2.6 in its maximum dimensions.\r\nIrregular thrombus is seen within the aneurism on colour flow studies.\r\nProstate is normal in echo \u2013 pattern and measures 4 x 3 x 3cms. Prostatic capsule is\r\nintact. Urinary bladder is normal in capacity and contour. Post void residual urine is\r\nnot significant.\r\nImpression: Mild hepatomegaly with aneurism of lower abdominal aorta just above\r\nthe bifurcation.\u201D\r\n4. Dr. K.G. Deshpande Memorial Center, Nagpur was consulted by the 4 For short,\r\nthe \u2018Complainant\u2019 5 For short, the \u2018patient\u2019 patient on 15.04.1998 and Dr. Deshpande\r\ndiagnosed the following:\r\n\u201CA case of Abd Aortic Aneurysum Involvement on left side with Left PVB (Embolism)\r\nH\/O Trauma 1983, Pain Left LL 1990 S\/O Embolism Vascular Duplex Seen S\/O\r\nLarge Abd. A. Aneurysum 6*3*5.1cm Adv- Urgent Surgical repair of the aneurysum\u201D\r\n5. After diagnosis, Dr. Deshpande referred the patient to the appellantDoctor who is a Vascular Surgeon. The patient consulted the appellant-Doctor on 21.4.1998. The\r\nDoctor ordered the admission of the patient as an urgent case of aorta aneurysum. On 22.4.1998,\r\nthe Doctor advised urgent DSA\/CAT Scan [Digital Sub-Traction Angiography and Computerized\r\nAxial Tomography] and surgery after noticing the following physical conditions:\r\n\u201CA 42 years old male with aorta pain left lower limb and right leg below knee. Gradual\r\nClaudication BP \u2013 100\/80 Ischaemic changes both lower limbs. Seen with impending\r\nGangrene Both legs left muscles are tested.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201D\r\n6. The Doctor after examining the patient recorded that there were ischemic changes\r\nin both lower limbs and also noted an impending gangrene. Subsequent to the\r\npre-operative preparations, surgery was conducted on 23.04.1998 by a team of\r\nsurgeons including Dr. Partha and Dr. Bindra, led by the appellant-Doctor. The\r\noperation notes read as thus:\r\n\u201COn inspection there was a huge aneurysum on the latral aspect on left side arising\r\ninfra renal.\r\nIt was densely adherent to the surrounding structure. The aneurysum was directed\r\nout. The tape was passed around the left Renal artery\/vein for retraction. A tape was\r\npassed around the aorta just below the renal artery and above the aneurysum. Both\r\nthe common iliac arteries were exposed. Tapes were passed around both the iliac\r\narteries.\r\nAfter achieving proper exposure\/slinging around all the vessels. The aorta was iron\r\nclamped just infra-renally. The aneurysum opened out. The aorta transected and\r\nboth illiacs transected. (A PTFE \u2018Y\u2019 Limb Graft) was sutured in place. The short main\r\nlimb to the aorta using continuous prolure and both the limbs of the graft were\r\nsutured to the common iliacs end to end anastomosis on right side. After checking\r\nthe flow in the graft after suture the upper end the lower anastomosis were done.\r\nOn the left side, the side of the graft was sutured the end of the common iliac. The\r\nlimb of the graft further brought down through a tunnel to the femoral artery and the\r\nend of the graft sutured to the side of the femoral artery.\r\nAfter achieving proper haemostasis and checking the pulsation.\r\nIntra-operatively, the abdomen closed using drainage tubes.\r\nThe patient was later shifted to recovery room on ventilator with stable vital signs.\u201D\r\n7. It is the case of the complainant that on 24.4.1998 at about 4 am, that is the night\r\nafter surgery, the nurse who was attending the patient observed that the pulsation of\r\nthe patient had become feeble and body temperature was low and the lower limbs\r\nhad gone cold. The relatives were informed at about 7 a.m. that the patient was\r\nunconscious, legs were cold with no pulsation. The complainant further alleged that\r\nthe nurse had informed the Doctor at 4 am but he came only at 9.30 a.m. The patient\r\nupon assessment by the Doctor was directed to get second DSA test but DSA machine\r\nwas out of order. Hence, the Doctor advised angiography but the patient was made to\r\nwait for both DSA test as well as for angiography. One Dr. B.K. Goyal examined the\r\npatient and reported that the patient had probably developed block of abdominal\r\naorta.\r\n8. The angiography conducted at 12.30 pm on 24.4.1998 showed a block (clot) at the\r\ngraft due to which the blood supply to the lower limbs had totally stopped. The\r\ncomplainant contended that the earlier surgery was not performed correctly and\r\nthere was negligence in conducting the same. A decision was taken to re\r\nexplore the earlier surgery done at about 3:30 pm but since all the four operation theatres were\r\noccupied, he could only be taken to the operation theatre for re-grafting at 5.30 p.m. As there was no\r\npulsation in the graft and there was clot in the graft extending into both limbs of the graft, a fresh\r\ngraft was sutured and the patient was shifted to recovery room and put on ventilator.\r\n9. It was contended by the Hospital that the patient was in the care of qualified doctors such as Dr.\r\nNemish Shah, Dr. J. A. Pachore, Dr. A.L. Kripalani, Dr. Partha, Dr. H.S. Bindra and many others\r\nthroughout his course of admission and no stone was left unturned to ascertain the complications\r\nand treat the same. Various specialist doctors were treating the patient and medicines\/treatment\r\nwas timely regulated and changed as and when required on a daily basis. Regular daily dialysis,\r\ndressing of wounds etc. were also done. However, unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the\r\nqualified doctors, the patient did not respond to the treatment and passed away on 12.06.1998.\r\n10. The complainant in the complaint enumerated the facts suggesting negligence and deficiency of\r\nservice on the part of the appellants. The averments made by the complainant and the\r\ncorresponding reply by the Doctor is extracted hereinunder:\r\n\u201C34. In all cases of grafting \u201C16. Without prejudice to the above the patient is kept\r\nunder close and with reference to para 34 of the observation to find out whether\r\ncomplaint under reply, I deny the blood is flowing normally. In case allegations made\r\ntherein are false. there is stoppage or lack of flow With further reference to the said\r\nimmediate action is taken to para it is substantially correct to control the situation\r\nbecause lack state that in all cases of grafting of blood is certain to rupture and\r\npatient is kept under closer deaden the muscles. The tissues observations to find out\r\nwhether cannot survive without blood flow. blood is flowing normally. In case But in\r\nthis case after the patient there is stoppage or lack of flow was taken to recovery room\r\nhe was immediate action is taken to control not examined by any doctor. The the\r\nsituation because lack of blood attending nurse observed at 4.30 is certain to rupture\r\nand deaden the a.m. on 24.4.98 that lower limbs muscles. I say and submit that even\r\nhad become cold and did inform while treating the said deceased, the doctors. The\r\ndoctors were utmost care was taken by the opp. called in writing at 8 a.m. but Dr.\r\nparty in post operative period. In Somaya came at 9.30 a.m. This this connection I\r\nsay and submit time gap was enough to rupture that patient was kept in Cardio the\r\nmuscles. The process is Vascular Incentive Care Unit CVICU irreversible. It cannot be\r\ncorrected. which is considered to be finest in Timely medical care could have India.\r\nThe patient was continuously saved the life of the complainant. monitored by\r\nefficient and trained nursing staff and was also monitored for 24 hours by resident\r\ndoctor. With further reference to the said para I deny that at about 4.30 a.m. on\r\n24-4-1998 the attending nurse observed that lower limbs had become cold as alleged\r\nor at all. I deny that, doctors were summoned and that I came to the said unit, only at\r\n9.30 a.m. as alleged or at all.\r\nI deny that, because of the so called delay on my part further complications took\r\nplace in the case of the said deceased as alleged or at all. I say and submit that\r\nimmediately after I received message from the resident doctor attached to the opp.\r\nparty no.1 attended the said patient at about 9.00 a.m. and not at 9.30 a.m. as sought\r\nto be suggested by the complainant.\r\n35. That in spite of the critical 17. With reference to paras 35 and condition of the\r\ncomplainant on 36 of the complaint under reply, I 24.4.98, he was made to stand in\r\ndeny that in spite of critical queue for DSA test for more than 3 condition of the\r\ncomplainant on hours. This delay further worsened 24.4.1998 he was deliberately\r\nmade the condition of the complaint it to stand in queue for DSA test for appears that\r\nBombay Hospital had more than 3 hours. I deny that the no medical ethics. said delay\r\nwas deliberate and due to the said delay the condition of\r\n36. The situation turned darker the said patient, further worsened because after\r\nwaiting for 3 hours as alleged or at all. I say and submit the complainant was\r\ninformed that that to the best to my knowledge the machine was dis-functional.\r\nimmediately I suggested DSA test on 24.4.1998, the staff of the opp.\r\nparty no.1 took the said deceased for DSA test but unfortunately during the relevant\r\ntime the equipment was not functioning properly and as soon as the defects were\r\nlocated the said test was conducted to enable the opp parties to give further\r\ntreatment to the said deceased. I say and submit that on perusal of the case papers on\r\nrecord, it is crystal clear that the best possible treatment and due care was given to\r\nthe said deceased under circumstances. I say and submit that during the relevant\r\ntime the condition of the said deceased was critical and therefore it was not possible\r\nto shift the said patient to any other hospital in nearby vicinity for any test including\r\nDSA. It is also significant, to note here that during the relevant time DSA test\r\nmachinery was available only in Jaslok Hospital, Hinduja Hospital and Breach Candy\r\nHospital. However, it was not possible to shift the said patient for the said test\r\nconsidering the patient condition. In any event I dispute the allegations made by the\r\ncomplainant as the complainant\u2019s failed to substantiate the said allegations by\r\nproducing any independent material on that behalf.\r\nBesides this the said allegations are not based or supported on the basis of the\r\nindependent expert\u2019s opinion.\r\n37.

It is significant to note here that if the complainants were\r\nreally convinced about the so called negligence on the part of the opp. parties, surely the\r\ncomplainants or other relatives of the said deceased would have lodged complaint with local police\r\nstation or insisted for post-mortem of the said deceased and\/or would have approached the Court\r\nagainst the hospital as well as against me.\r\nThe very fact that present complaint has been filed on 10.7.1999 without sending any proper notice\r\nthereby railing upon the opp. parties to explain the so called negligence also supports my case that\r\npresent complaint is filed with ulterior motive with an intention to knock out hand sum ransom\r\nfrom the opp.\r\nparties.\r\n42. That leaving the patient 22. With reference to para 42 of the fighting for his life in the care of\r\ncomplaint under reply, I deny that inexperienced junior doctors viz.

In this\r\nconnection, I say and submit that during the relevant time i.e. between 9th May 1998 to 7.6.1998, I\r\nhad to China, England and USA to attend medical conferences and both the said conferences were\r\nfixed well in advance. Similarly the allegations of the complainants that Dr. Partha and Dr. Bindra\r\nare inexperienced junior doctors is also baseless for the simple reasons that both the\r\naforementioned doctors are postgraduate and experienced in their respective field and both are\r\nhaving adequate experience in the aforementioned field. Besides this the said deceased was being\r\ntreated by senior specialist at the opp. party no.1 hospital and in case of any emergency opp. party\r\nno.1 could have arranged senior experts and therefore merely because I was away from India that\r\ntoo in connection with my professional activities, the complainants should not be permitted to make\r\ncapital out of it.\r\n43.

The affidavit of the complainant is on the same lines as the averments made in the complaint\r\nbefore the Commission.\r\n12. The grievance of the complainant against the appellants can be summarized under the following\r\nheads:\r\n(a) The Doctor had not examined the patient after surgery;\r\n(b) The patient was made to stand in queue for DSA test despite his critical condition\r\nwhereafter the machine was found to be dysfunctional;\r\n(c) Angiography was performed after 8 hours of discovering that blood supply has\r\nstopped;\r\n(d) The Hospital delayed treatment by 12 hours as no operation theatre was available;\r\n(e) The Doctor did not attend the patient and left him in the care of inexperienced\r\ndoctors;\r\n(f) Doctor failed to amputate legs on time on account of gangrene and did not try to\r\ntreat the gangrene; and\r\n(g) The reliance on the principle of res ipsa loquitor to support the finding that it is a\r\ncase of medical negligence.\r\n13. Learned Commission while analyzing the evidence observed that the complainant had filed\r\nevidence affidavits but the Hospital and the Doctor, though have filed their written versions, but\r\nhave not filed evidence by way of affidavits except an affidavit of Dr. Kripalani. We however find at\r\nthe outset that such primary observation is itself erroneous. The Hospital and the Doctor had filed\r\ntheir written version by way of affidavit dated 7.1.2000 i.e., the same date on which Dr. Kripalani\r\nhad filed an affidavit. The Commission has overlooked the fact that written version is by way of an\r\naffidavit. Later, the Hospital had also filed evidence affidavit on 13.07.2009 whereas the Doctor had\r\nfiled a short affidavit on 30.8.2009 reiterating and confirming the statements, averments and the\r\ncontentions raised in the written version filed on 7.1.2000. Thus, there is factual error in the order\r\nof the Commission.\r\n14. The Commission had commented adversely against the Doctor that he had not seen or attended\r\nthe patient for several days before his departure for his tour to U.S.A and U.K for about a month and\r\nhad not even indicated the name of any super specialist in his field who should look after the patient\r\nin his absence. The Commission mentioned that the Doctor observed at the first instance within a\r\ncouple of days of admission at the Hospital that there was impending gangrene and that Dr. Partha\r\nand Dr. Bindra did not take timely decision for amputation of legs and by the time Dr. Pachore was\r\nconsulted, it was too late. Moreover, it was also noted that Dr. Pachore had scolded Dr. Partha for\r\nthe delay in consulting him as even if the amputation was done at such belated occasion, nothing\r\ncould be said about the survival of the patient.\r\n15. The Commission opined that considering the conditions in India, it is very difficult to secure the\r\npresence of an expert doctor to file an affidavit against another expert doctor and thus it would be a\r\ncase of res ipsa loquitor. It was mentioned that though the Doctor was present at Mumbai from\r\n29.4.1998 to 9.5.1998, he did not give advice for amputation of the legs and thereafter from 9.5.1998\r\nto 7.6.1998, he went to U.S.A and U.K to attend medical conferences. He had visited the patient only\r\non 8.6.1998 after several days of amputation. The Commission relied upon judgment in Whitehouse\r\nv. Jordan and Anr.6 to apply the principle of res ipsa loquitor. A reference was also made to an\r\narticle \u201CRepair of Infraneral Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs): Introduction\u201D to say that the\r\nmortality associated with repair of AAAs has been greatly reduced by improvements in preoperative\r\nevaluation and perioperative care. Another text book by Robert B. Rutherford was referred to note\r\nthat paraplegia was a rare complication in the case of Aneurysms whereas in the present matter,\r\nparaplegia occurred instantaneously.\r\n16. Learned counsel for the appellants herein argued that the Hospital is a renowned hospital having\r\nfour operation theatres and advance machines including DSA. Three other hospitals in Mumbai\r\nsuch as Jaslok Hospital, Hinduja Hospital and Breach Candy Hospital alone 6 [1981] 1 Weekly Law\r\nReports 246 had DSA machines at the relevant time. The Hospital in its affidavit had inter alia\r\nmentioned that the DSA test is not a bed side test. The patient has to be carefully shifted to the\r\ncardiac cauterization department where the DSA machine was installed. The patient hence had to be\r\nstabilized before he was shifted to DSA department. Since the patient was put on ventilator and on\r\nseveral support medications, it was not possible to immediately undergo the DSA test. But when the\r\npatient was taken for DSA test, the machine developed certain technical problem. Since the DSA\r\nmachine was not working, angiography was thought to be the best possible test and was thus\r\nconducted. The Hospital had specialized staff in all branches of medicine and the medical assistance\r\nas was required from time to time including nephrology, orthopedics etc. was provided to the\r\npatient. It was argued that the professional competence of Doctor has not been doubted even by the\r\nCommission but two factors have been taken against the Doctor for holding him negligent; first, that\r\nhe did not visit the patient soon after the surgery till 9\/9.30 a.m. on the next day to verify the blood\r\nflow after the surgery, and second, he did not visit the patient from 29.4.1998 to 9.5.1998 when he\r\nwas in Mumbai and from 9.5.1998 to 7.6.1998 when he went abroad for attending medical\r\nconferences.\r\n17. We do not find that the basis of finding the Doctor negligent in providing medical care is\r\nsustainable as there are both legal and factual errors in the findings recorded by the Commission.\r\n18. Dr. K.G. Deshpande had referred the patient to the Doctor on 15.4.1998 with advice of urgent\r\nsurgical repair of Aneurysum. The patient had taken another six days to consult Doctor at Mumbai\r\nand it was only on 21.4.1998 that the patient was examined by the Doctor and was advised\r\nimmediate Aneurysmectomy in view of the impending gangrene. Therefore, gangrene was not found\r\nto be impending after few days of admission to the Hospital but even before the patient was\r\nadmitted. The patient was in critical condition when the Doctor was consulted on 21.4.1998 and\r\nsurgery was thereafter performed within two days.\r\n19. Further, the non-working of the DSA machine and consequent delay in performing the test\r\ncannot be said to be negligence on the part of the Doctor or the Hospital. The DSA machine is a\r\nlarge, expensive and complicated machine which unfortunately developed certain technical problem\r\nat the time when patient had to be tested. Any machine can become non-functional because of\r\ninnumerable factors beyond the human control as the machines involve various mechanical,\r\nelectrical and electronic components. The DSA test was conducted in the Hospital on 22.4.1998 and\r\nhence DSA machine cannot be said to be dysfunctional for a long time. The alternative process to\r\ndetermine the blood flow was carried out by angiography and the decision for re-exploration was\r\ntaken at 12.30 p.m. No fault can be attached to the Hospital if the operation theatres were occupied\r\nwhen the patient was taken for surgery. Operation theatres cannot be presumed to be available at all\r\ntimes. Therefore, non-availability of an emergency operation theatre during the period when\r\nsurgeries were being performed on other patients is not a valid ground to hold the Hospital\r\nnegligent in any manner.\r\n20. The re-exploration of operative notes dated 24.4.1998 shows that a fresh graft was sutured in\r\nplace after establishing the flow. The patient was then put on ventilator and shifted to recovery\r\nroom. On 25.4.1998, a note by Dr. Bindra indicated that the patient was seen by Dr. Shruti. It was\r\nnoted that there was no movement in both the legs but had pin prick sensation and below\r\nmid-thigh, sensation was present on the lower limbs. Further, legs were warm till the ankles and the\r\nfeet were cold. On 27.4.1998, Dr. H.S. Bindra had sought consultation from Dr. Khadilkar giving\r\ncase history that limbs were warm and that the patient had pain in the lumber region and was also\r\nfeeling tightness in both the lower limbs. Dr. Khadilkar noted his impressions that it was very likely\r\nlower spinal cord\/conus syndrome and thereafter advised MRI of the lower cervical spine and till\r\nthen to continue with the medicine pentosiflin and lomodex and for muscle ischemia \u2013 high CK and\r\nMyoglobulin. Dr. Khadilkar suggested the same treatment to continue on 28.4.98. On 29.4.1998, Dr.\r\nKhadilkar had reported the sensory level dropped to upper 1\/3rd of the thigh and that there was no\r\npower in limbs. No changes were however seen in the MRI report. It was also reported that probably\r\nmyonecrosis was playing more significant role in the weakness. The patient was put on dialysis\r\nthereafter.\r\n21. The patient was examined by Dr. Kripalani or his unit from 1.5.1998 and thereafter for many\r\ndays till 23.5.1998. The dialysis was being conducted in the meantime as well. The patient was being\r\nmonitored by Dr. Bindra throughout. Subsequently, the patient was referred to Dr. Amarapurkar on\r\n12.5.1998 when it was noted that Ischemic Injury to liver needed no treatment on 13.5.1998. The\r\npatient was then referred to Dr. Amin for enternal nuirisim on 16.5.1998.\r\n22. It was further noted on 18.05.1998 from Colour Flow Imaging of limb arteries that both common\r\nfemoral, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries were patent. The flow in both posterior tibial\r\narteries was of low velocity and of venous type, suggesting refilled flow. Dr. Pachore also examined\r\nthe patient on 27.5.1998 and observed that the patient had wet gangrene below knee and was thus\r\nadvised amputation. On 29.5.1998, the patient was operated for amputation below the knee at the\r\nlevel of tibial tuberosity for treatment of wet gangrene and the Bilateral Guillatine Amputation was\r\ncarried out.\r\nOn 30.05.1998, it was noted that the acute renal failure was improving. Further septicemia was\r\ndiagnosed on 30.05.1998. Later, on 12.06.1998, the patient was put on ventilator and he\r\nsubsequently passed away at 9.30 pm due to septicemic shock.\r\n23. It is to be noted that it is not the case of the complainant that Doctor was not possessed of\r\nrequisite skill in carrying out the operation. In fact, the patient was referred to him by Dr.\r\nDeshpande keeping in view the expertise of the Doctor in vascular surgery. There is no proof that\r\nthere was any negligence in performing the surgery on 23.4.1998 or in the process of re-exploration\r\non 24.4.1998. The allegation is of failure of the Doctor to take the follow-up action after surgery on\r\n23.4.1998, a delayed decision to amputate the leg subsequent to re-exploration on 24.4.1998, and\r\nthe alleged undue foreign visit of the Doctor.\r\n24. In respect to such contention of the Doctor being on a foreign visit, it is well known a medical\r\nprofessional has to upgrade himself with the latest development in his field which may require him\r\nto attend conferences held both in and outside the country. Mere fact that the Doctor had gone\r\nabroad cannot lead to an inference of medical negligence as the patient was admitted in a hospital\r\nhaving specialists in multi-faculties. Two doctors from the unit of the Doctor namely Dr. Bindra and\r\nDr. Partha, both post graduates, were present to attend to the patient. Moreover, as per the stand of\r\nthe Hospital and the Doctor, the patient was kept in Cardio Vascular Intensive Care Unit after the\r\nsurgery and was continuously being monitored by qualified post-graduate doctors including Dr.\r\nNemish Shah, Head of Cardio Vascular Surgery. The patient was even attended by other specialist\r\ndoctors as well which is evident from the brief summary of treatment given to the patient. The\r\nexperts in the other fields have been consulted from time to time and the treatment was modulated\r\naccordingly. In spite of the treatment, if the patient had not survived, the doctors cannot be blamed\r\nas even the doctors with the best of their abilities cannot prevent the inevitable.\r\n25. The blood was flowing properly soon after the surgery but later the formation of clot was\r\nconfirmed after the angiography test was conducted at 12.30 p.m. An immediate decision was taken\r\nfor re- exploration at 3.30 p.m. The allegation of delay in treatment after the surgery seems to be\r\nbaseless as the patient was being administered antibiotics like Metrogyl 400 and Piperacillin\r\nInjection which are used for treatment in gangrene. Dr. Kripalani in his affidavit denied the\r\nallegation leveled by the complainant. Dr. Kripalani had treated patient continuously including\r\ncarrying out the dialysis. In respect of the allegation that doctors failed to amputate legs on time,\r\nefforts were being made to save the limbs as amputation is considered as the last resort. The\r\namputation was done as per the advice of Dr. Pachore. In the present era of super- specialization,\r\none doctor is not a solution for all problems of a patient. Each problem is dealt with by an expert in\r\nthe concerned field and that is what is apparent from the medical record. The stand of the\r\ncomplainant is that since surgery was performed by a doctor, he alone would be responsible for\r\ndifferent aspects of the treatment required and given to the patient. However, it is an incorrect\r\nassumption to be made.\r\n26. It is a case where the patient was in serious condition impending gangrene even before\r\nadmission to the Hospital but even after surgery and re-exploration, if the patient does not survive,\r\nthe fault cannot be fastened on the doctors as a case of medical negligence. It is too much to expect\r\nfrom a doctor to remain on the bed side of the patient throughout his stay in the hospital which was\r\nbeing expected by the complainant here. A doctor is expected to provide reasonable care which is\r\nnot proved to be lacking in any manner in the present case.\r\n27. The sole basis of finding of negligence against the Hospital is of res ipsa loquitor. It is to be noted\r\nthat res ipsa loquitor is a rule of evidence. This Court in a judgment reported as Syad Akbar v. State\r\nof Karnataka7 explained the principle in a criminal trial as under:\r\n\u201C19. As a rule, mere proof that an event has happened or an accident has occurred,\r\nthe cause of which is unknown, is not evidence of negligence. But the peculiar\r\ncircumstances con- stituting the event or accident, in a particular case, may\r\nthemselves proclaim in concordant, clear and unambiguous voices the negligence of\r\nsomebody as the cause of the event or accident. It is to such cases that the maxim res\r\nipsa lo- quitur may apply, if the cause of the accident is unknown and no reasonable\r\nexplanation as to the cause is coming forth from the defendant. To emphasise the\r\npoint, it may be reiter- ated that in such cases, the event or accident must be of a kind\r\nwhich does not happen in the ordinary course of things if those who have the\r\nmanagement and control use due care. But, according to some decisions, satisfaction\r\nof this condi- tion alone is not sufficient for res ipsa to come into play and it has to be\r\nfurther satisfied that the event which caused the accident was within the defendant's\r\ncontrol. The reason for this second requirement is that where the defendant has control of the thing which caused the injury, he is in a better po- sition than the plaintiff\r\nto explain how the accident occurred. Instances of such special kind of accidents\r\nwhich \u201Ctell their own story\u201D of being offsprings of negligence, are furnished by cases,\r\nsuch as where a motor vehicle mounts or projects over a pavement and hurts\r\nsomebody there or travelling in the ve- hicle; one car ramming another from behind,\r\nor even a head- on collision on the wrong side of the road. (See per Lord Nor- mand\r\nin Barkway v. South Wales Transport Co. [(1950) 1 All ER 392, 399] ; Cream v. Smith\r\n[(1961) 8 AER 349] ;Rich- ley v. Faull [(1965) 1 WLR 1454 : (1965) 3 All ER 109])\r\n20. Thus, for the application of the maxim res ipsa loquitur \u201Cno less important a\r\nrequirement is that the res must not only bespeak negligence, but pin it on the\r\ndefendant\u201D.\r\nxxx xxx xxx\r\n26. From the above conspectus, two lines of approach in regard to the application and effect of the maxim res ipsa lo- quitur are discernible. According to the\r\nfirst, where the maxim applies, it operates as an exception to the general 7 (1980) 1 SCC 30 rule that\r\nthe burden of proof of the alleged negligence is, in the first instance, on the plaintiff. In this view, if\r\nthe nature of an accident is such that the mere happening of it is evidence of negligence, such as,\r\nwhere a motor vehicle without appar- ent cause leaves the highway, or overturns or in fair visibility\r\nruns into an obstacle; or brushes the branches of an over- hanging tree, resulting in injury, or where\r\nthere is a duty on the defendant to exercise care, and the circumstances in which the injury\r\ncomplained of happened are such that with the exercise of the requisite care no risk would in the\r\nordinary course ensue, the burden shifts or is in the first instance on the defendant to disprove his\r\nliability. Such shifting or casting of the burden on the defendant is on account of a presump- tion of\r\nlaw and fact arising against the defendant from the constituent circumstances of the accident itself,\r\nwhich be- speak negligence of the defendant. This is the view taken in several decisions of English\r\ncourts. [For instance, see Burke v. Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Rail Co. [(1870) 22 LJ 442]\r\n; Moore v.R. Fox & Sons [(1956) 1 QB 596 : (1956) 1 All ER 182] . Also see paras 70, 79 and 80 of\r\nHalsbury's Laws of England, Third Edn., Vol. 28, and the rulings mentioned in the footnotes\r\nthereunder.]\r\n27. According to the other line of approach, res ipsa loquitur is not a special rule of substantive law;\r\nthat functionally, it is only an aid in the evaluation of evidence, \u201Can application of the general\r\nmethod of inferring one or more facts in issue from circumstances proved in evidence\u201D. In this view,\r\nthe maxim res ipsa loquitur does not require the raising of any presumption of law which must shift\r\nthe onus on the defen- dant. It only, when applied appropriately, allows the drawing of a permissive\r\ninference of fact, as distinguished from a mandatory presumption properly so-called, having regard\r\nto the totality of the circumstances and probabilities of the case. Res ipsa is only a means of\r\nestimating logical probabil- ity from the circumstances of the accident. Looked at from this angle,\r\nthe phrase (as Lord Justice Kennedy put it [Rus- sel v. London & South Western Railway Co, (1908)\r\n24 TLR 548] ) only means, \u201Cthat there is, in the circumstances of the particular case, some evidence\r\nwhich, viewed not as a matter of conjecture, but of reasonable argument, makes it more probable\r\nthat there was some negligence, upon the facts as shown and undisputed, than that the occurrence\r\ntook place without negligence .... It means that the circumstances are, so to speak, eloquent of the\r\nnegligence of somebody who brought about the state of things which is complained of.\u201D\r\n28. Recently, a three Judge Bench in a judgment reported as Iffco Tokio General Insurance\r\nCompany Limited v. Pearl Beverages Lim- ited8 approved the aforesaid judgment in a case of\r\nmedical negli- gence being examined by the consumer fora. It was held as under:\r\n\u201C86. Thus, it is used in cases of tort and where the facts with- out anything more\r\nclearly and unerringly point to negligence. The principle of res ipsa loquitur, as such,\r\nappears to be inap- posite, when, what is in question, is whether driver was under\r\nthe influence of alcohol. It may be another matter that though the principle as such is\r\ninapplicable, the manner in which the accident occurred may along with other\r\ncircum- stances point to the driver being under the influence of alco- hol.\u201D\r\n29. In Martin F. D'Souza v. Mohd. Ishfaq9, this court observed that the doctor cannot be held liable\r\nfor medical negligence by applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur for the reason that a patient has\r\nnot favourably responded to a treatment given by a doctor or a surgery has failed. There is a\r\ntendency to blame the doctor when a patient dies or suffers some mishap. This is an intolerant\r\nconduct of the family members to not accept the death in such cases. The in- creased cases of\r\nmanhandling of medical professionals who worked day and night without their comfort has been\r\nvery well seen in this pandemic. This Court held as under:-\r\n8 (2021) 7 SCC 704 9(2009) 3 SCC 1 \u201C40. Simply because a patient has not favourably\r\nresponded to a treatment given by a doctor or a surgery has failed, the doctor cannot\r\nbe held straightaway liable for medical negligence by applying the doctrine of res ipsa\r\nloquitur. No sensible professional would intentionally commit an act or omission\r\nwhich would result in harm or injury to the patient since the professional reputation\r\nof the professional would be at stake. A single failure may cost him dear in his lapse.\r\nxxx xxx xxx\r\n42. When a patient dies or suffers some mishap, there is a tendency to blame the\r\ndoctor for this. Things have gone wrong and, therefore, somebody must be punished\r\nfor it.\r\nHowever, it is well known that even the best professionals, what to say of the average professional,\r\nsometimes have failures. A lawyer cannot win every case in his professional career but surely he\r\ncannot be penalised for losing a case provided he appeared in it and made his submissions.\u201D\r\n30. In case of medical negligence, this Court in a celebrated judgment reported as Jacob Mathew v.\r\nState of Punjab and Anr.10 held that simple lack of care, an error of judgment or an accident, is not\r\na proof of negligence on the part of a medical professional. The Court held as under:\r\n\u201C48. We sum up our conclusions as under:\r\n(1) Negligence is the breach of a duty caused by omission to do something which a\r\nreasonable man guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct\r\nof human affairs would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. The\r\ndefinition of negli- gence as given in Law of Torts, Ratanlal & Dhirajlal (edited by Justice G.P.\r\nSingh), referred to hereinabove, holds good. Negligence becomes actionable on account of injury\r\nresult- 10 (2005) 6 SCC 1 ing from the act or omission amounting to negligence at- tributable to the\r\nperson sued. The essential components of negligence are three: \u201Cduty\u201D, \u201Cbreach\u201D and \u201Cresulting damage\u201D.\r\n(2) Negligence in the context of the medical profession nec- essarily calls for a treatment with a\r\ndifference. To infer rash- ness or negligence on the part of a professional, in particu- lar a doctor,\r\nadditional considerations apply. A case of occu- pational negligence is different from one of\r\nprofessional negligence. A simple lack of care, an error of judgment or an accident, is not proof of\r\nnegligence on the part of a med- ical professional. So long as a doctor follows a practice ac- ceptable\r\nto the medical profession of that day, he cannot be held liable for negligence merely because a better\r\nalter- native course or method of treatment was also available or simply because a more skilled\r\ndoctor would not have cho- sen to follow or resort to that practice or procedure which the accused\r\nfollowed. When it comes to the failure of taking precautions, what has to be seen is whether those\r\nprecau- tions were taken which the ordinary experience of men has found to be sufficient; a failure\r\nto use special or extraordi- nary precautions which might have prevented the particular happening\r\ncannot be the standard for judging the alleged negligence. So also, the standard of care, while\r\nassessing the practice as adopted, is judged in the light of knowledge available at the time of the\r\nincident, and not at the date of trial. Similarly, when the charge of negligence arises out of failure to\r\nuse some particular equipment, the charge would fail if the equipment was not generally available at\r\nthat par- ticular time (that is, the time of the incident) at which it is suggested it should have been\r\nused.\r\nxxx xxx xxx (4) The test for determining medical negligence as laid down in Bolam case [(1957) 1\r\nWLR 582 : (1957) 2 All ER 118 (QBD)] , WLR at p. 586 [ [Ed.: Also at All ER p. 121 D-F and set out\r\nin para 19, p. 19 herein.]] holds good in its ap- plicability in India.\r\nxxx xxx xxx (8) Res ipsa loquitur is only a rule of evidence and operates in the domain of civil law,\r\nspecially in cases of torts and helps in determining the onus of proof in actions relating to\r\nnegligence. It cannot be pressed in service for determin- ing per se the liability for negligence within\r\nthe domain of criminal law. Res ipsa loquitur has, if at all, a limited applica- tion in trial on a charge\r\nof criminal negligence.\u201D\r\n31. In another judgment reported as Arun Kumar Manglik v. Chirayu Health and Medicare Private\r\nLimited and Anr.11, this Court held that the standard of care as enunciated in Bolam case must\r\nevolve in consonance with its subsequent interpretation by English and Indian Courts. The\r\nthreshold to prove unreasonableness is set with due regard to the risks associated with medical\r\ntreatment and the conditions under which medical professionals\u2019 function. The Court held as under:\r\n\u201C45. In the practice of medicine, there could be varying approaches to treatment.\r\nThere can be a genuine difference of opinion. However, while adopting a course of\r\ntreatment, the medical professional must ensure that it is not unreasonable. The\r\nthreshold to prove unreasonableness is set with due regard to the risks associated\r\nwith medical treatment and the conditions under which medical professionals\r\nfunction. This is to avoid a situation where doctors resort to \u201Cdefensive medicine\u201D to\r\navoid claims of negligence, often to the detriment of the patient. Hence, in a specific\r\ncase where unreasonableness in professional conduct has been proven with regard to\r\nthe circumstances of that case, a professional cannot escape liability for medical\r\nevidence merely by relying on a body of professional opinion.\u201D 11 (2019) 7 SCC 401\r\n32. In C.P. Sreekumar (Dr.), MS (Ortho) v. S. Ramanujam12, this Court held that the Commission\r\nought not to presume that the alle- gations in the complaint are inviolable truth even though they remained unsupported by any evidence. This Court held as under:\r\n\u201C37. We find from a reading of the order of the Commission that it proceeded on the\r\nbasis that whatever had been al- leged in the complaint by the respondent was in fact\r\nthe in- violable truth even though it remained unsupported by any evidence. As\r\nalready observed in Jacob Mathew case [(2005) 6 SCC 1 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1369] the\r\nonus to prove medical negligence lies largely on the claimant and that this onus can\r\nbe discharged by leading cogent evidence. A mere averment in a complaint which is denied by the other side can, by no stretch of imagination, be said to be\r\nevidence by which the case of the complainant can be said to be proved. It is the obligation of the\r\ncomplainant to provide the facta probanda as well as the facta probantia.\u201D\r\n33. In another judgment reported as Kusum Sharma and Others v.\r\nBatra Hospital and Medical Research Centre and Others13, a complaint was filed attributing\r\nmedical negligence to a doctor who performed the surgery but while performing surgery, the tumour\r\nwas found to be malignant. The patient died later on after prolonged treatment in different\r\nhospitals. This Court held as under:\r\n\u201C47. Medical science has conferred great benefits on mankind, but these benefits are\r\nattended by considerable risks. Every surgical operation is attended by risks. We\r\ncannot take the benefits without taking risks. Every advancement in technique is also\r\nattended by risks.\r\n xxx xxx xxx\r\n12 (2009) 7 SCC 130\r\n13 (2010) 3 SCC 480\r\n72. The ratio of Bolam case [(1957) 1 WLR 582 : (1957) 2 All ER 118] is that it is\r\nenough for the defendant to show that the standard of care and the skill attained was\r\nthat of the ordinary competent medical practitioner exercising an ordinary degree of\r\nprofessional skill. The fact that the respondent charged with negligence acted in\r\naccordance with the general and approved practice is enough to clear him of the\r\ncharge. Two things are pertinent to be noted. Firstly, the standard of care, when\r\nassessing the practice as adopted, is judged in the light of knowledge available at the\r\ntime (of the incident), and not at the date of trial. Secondly, when the charge of\r\nnegligence arises out of failure to use some particular equipment, the charge would\r\nfail if the equipment was not generally available at that point of time on which it is\r\nsuggested as should have been used.\r\nxxx xxx xxx\r\n78. It is a matter of common knowledge that after happening of some unfortunate\r\nevent, there is a marked tendency to look for a human factor to blame for an\r\nuntoward event, a tendency which is closely linked with the desire to punish.\r\nThings have gone wrong and, therefore, somebody must be found to answer for it. A professional\r\ndeserves total protec- tion. The Penal Code, 1860 has taken care to ensure that people who act in\r\ngood faith should not be punished. Sec- tions 88, 92 and 370 of the Penal Code give adequate\r\nprotec- tion to the professionals and particularly medical profession- als.\u201D\r\n34. Recently, this Court in a judgment reported as Dr. Harish Kumar Khurana v. Joginder Singh &\r\nOthers14 held that hospital and the doctors are required to exercise sufficient care in treating the\r\npa- tient in all circumstances. However, in an unfortunate case, death may occur. It is necessary that\r\nsufficient material or medical evi- dence should be available before the adjudicating authority to\r\narrive 14 (2021) SCC Online SC 673 at the conclusion that death is due to medical negligence. Every\r\ndeath of a patient cannot on the face of it be considered to be medi- cal negligence. The Court held\r\nas under:\r\n\u201C11. \u2026\u2026.. Ordinarily an accident means an unintended and unforeseen injurious\r\noccurrence, something that does not occur in the usual course of events or that could\r\nnot be rea- sonably anticipated. The learned counsel has also referred to the decision\r\nin Martin F.D'Souza v. Mohd. Ishfaq, (2009) 3 SCC 1 wherein it is stated that simply\r\nbecause the patient has not favourably responded to a treatment given by doc- tor or\r\na surgery has failed, the doctor cannot be held straight away liable for medical\r\nnegligence by applying the doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitor. It is further observed\r\ntherein that sometimes despite best efforts the treatment of a doc- tor fails and the\r\nsame does not mean that the doctor or the surgeon must be held guilty of medical\r\nnegligence unless there is some strong evidence to suggest that the doctor is\r\nnegligent.\r\nxxx xxx xxx\r\n14. Having noted the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties, it is\r\nclear that in every case where the treatment is not successful or the patient dies\r\nduring surgery, it cannot be automatically assumed that the medical professional was negligent. To indicate negligence there should be material available on record\r\nor else appropriate medical evidence should be tendered. The negligence al- leged should be so\r\nglaring, in which event the principle of res ipsa loquitur could be made applicable and not based on\r\nperception. In the instant case, apart from the allegations made by the claimants before the NCDRC\r\nboth in the com- plaint and in the affidavit filed in the proceedings, there is no other medical\r\nevidence tendered by the complainant to indicate negligence on the part of the doctors who, on their\r\nown behalf had explained their position relating to the medi- cal process in their affidavit to explain\r\nthere was no negli- gence. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201D\r\n35. It may be mentioned here that the complainant had led no evidence of experts to prove the\r\nalleged medical negligence except their own affidavits. The experts could have proved if any of the\r\ndoctors in the Hospital providing treatment to the patient were deficient or negligent in service. A\r\nperusal of the medical record produced does not show any omission in the manner of treatment. The\r\nexperts of different specialities and super-specialities of medicine were available to treat and guide\r\nthe course of treatment of the patient. The doctors are expected to take reasonable care but none of\r\nthe professionals can assure that the patient would overcome the surgical procedures. Dr. Kripalani\r\nhas been attributed to have informed the complainant that the patient\u2019s legs were not working but\r\nDr. Kripalani denied all the averments by filing of an affidavit.\r\n36. As discussed above, the sole basis of finding the appellants negligent was res ipsa loquitor which\r\nwould not be applicable herein keeping in view the treatment record produced by the Hospital\r\nand\/or the Doctor. There was never a stage when the patient was left unattended. The patient was in\r\na critical condition and if he could not survive even after surgery, the blame cannot be passed on to\r\nthe Hospital and the Doctor who provided all possible treatment within their means and capacity.\r\nThe DSA test was conducted by the Hospital itself on 22.4.1998. However, since it became\r\ndysfunctional on 24.4.1998 and considering the critical condition of the patient, an alternative\r\nangiography test was advised and conducted and the re-exploration was thus planned. It is only a\r\nmatter of chance that all the four operation theatres of the Hospital were occupied when the patient\r\nwas to undergo surgery. We do not find that the expectation of the patient to have an emergency\r\noperation theatre is reasonable as the hospital can provide only as many operation theatres as the\r\npatient load warrants. If the operation theatres were occupied at the time when the operation of the\r\npatient was contemplated, it cannot be said that there is a negligence on the part of the Hospital. A\r\nteam of specialist doctors was available and also have attended to the patient but unfortunately\r\nnature had the last word and the patient breathed his last. The family may not have coped with the\r\nloss of their loved one, but the Hospital and the Doctor cannot be blamed as they provided the\r\nrequisite care at all given times. No doctor can assure life to his patient but can only attempt to treat\r\nhis patient to the best of his ability which was being done in the present case as well.\r\n37. Therefore, we find that the findings recorded by the Commission holding the Hospital and the\r\nDoctor guilty of medical negligence are not sustainable in law. Consequently, the present appeals are\r\nallowed. The order passed by the Commission is set aside and the complaint is dismissed.\r\n38. By virtue of an interim order passed by this Court on 8.3.2010, a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs was\r\ndisbursed to the complainant. The said amount is ordered to be treated as ex gratia payment to the\r\ncomplainant and not to be recovered back by either the Hospital or the Doctor.\r\n.............................................J.

          "judgement":"Uday Umesh Lalit, J.\r\n1. This appeal challenges the judgment and final order dated 03.03.2020 passed by the High Court\r\nof Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh dismissing CR A-S-1759-SB-2004 preferred by the appellants\r\nand affirming their conviction and sentence under Section 15 of the Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (\u201Cthe NDPS Act\u201D for short).\r\n2. The basic facts and the case of prosecution as recorded by the High Court in its judgment are as\r\nunder:\r\n\u201C2. The facts as put forth by the prosecution are to the effect that on 28.01.2002, S.I.\r\nNand Lal alongwith fellow police officials were present at the canal bridge on\r\nSurtia-Rori road, where he received a secret information to the effect that the accused\r\nare selling poppy straw in a vehicle bearing registration number GUD-4997 on a\r\n\u2018kacha path\u2019 at Rori-Jatana road and they can be apprehended if raid is conducted\r\nAccordingly, a raid was conducted and the accused were found sitting in the jeep\r\nbearing registration number GUD-4997 at the aforesaid place. Major Singh,\r\nco-accused of the appellants, managed to slip away, whereas, the appellants were\r\napprehend at the spot. They were found sitting upon two bags kept in the said jeep.\r\nNotices under Section 50 of the Act were served upon them but the appellants\r\nreposed faith upon the police officials. The search of the bags led to the recovery of\r\npoppy straw. One bag was containing 39 kg of poppy straw and the second bag was\r\ncontaining 36 kg of poppy straw. Two samples weighing 100 grams each were\r\nseparated from each bag. The sample parcels and the bulk parcels were converted\r\ninto separate parcels and sealed with the seal bearing impression 'CS'. The jeep\r\nalongwith weighing scale, two weights of 500 grams each were also recovered and\r\ntaken into possession vide recovery memos. Ruqa was recorded and dispatched to the\r\npolice station on the basis thereof, the FIR was registered. Subsequently, Major\r\nSingh, co-accused, was arrested. and on completion of investigation, the challan was\r\npresented in the Court.\r\n3. The charge was framed. The contents thereof were read over and explained to the appellants, to\r\nwhich they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\r\n4. In support of its allegations, the prosecution has examined four witnesses. Inspector Nand Lal\r\n(PW4) has conducted the search of the accused in the presence of ASI Jaswant Singh (PW3). The\r\ncase property was retained in the malkhana by Kuldeep Singh (PW2) and Constable Gurjit Singh\r\n(PW 1) took the sample parcels to the FSL. The prosecution has also 2 of 10 produced documentary\r\nevidence to substantiate the version as put forth by it.\u201D\r\n3. By order dated 15.03.2002, on an application preferred by him, the vehicle in question was\r\nreleased by the Trial Court in favour of accused Gurdeep Singh.\r\n4. During trial, PW4 Inspector Nand Lal, the Investigating Officer deposed in his\r\nexamination-in-chief as under:\r\n\u201COn 28.1.2002 I was posted as Sub Inspector\/SHO in Police Station Rori. On that\r\nday, I alongwith ASI Jaswant Singh and other police officials were present at the\r\ncanal bridge on Surtia Rori-road in connection with patrolling. I received a secret\r\ninformation that all the accused are selling poppy straw in a vehicle bearing\r\nno.GUD-4997 upon a 'Kacha Rasta at Rori- Jatana road and can be apprehended red\r\nhanded if a raid is conducted. I tried to join two persons who were going to water the\r\nfields in the investigations but they refused. Thereafter I organised a raiding party\r\nand conducted a raid. All the accused were found in the jeep bearing no GUD-4997,\r\nupon a kacha rasta by the side of Rori-Jatana Road, Upon seeing the police party, one\r\nof the accused, namely, Major fled the spot. I knew the accused Major Singh since\r\nlong. Remaining three accused were apprehended at the spot. Accused Boota Singh,\r\nGurdeep Singh and Gurmahender Singh alias Mitta were found sitting upon two bags\r\nlying in the said Jeep. Thereafter, I served notices Ex.PC, Ex.PD and Ex.PE upon\r\naccused Gurdeep, Boota and Gurmahender Singh respectively u\/s 50 of NDPS asking\r\nthem as to whether they desired their search before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate.\r\nVide replies Exl.PC\/1.1, Ex.PDA and Ex.PE\/I, accused Gurdeep Singh, Boota Singh\r\nand Gurmahender Singh alias Mitta declined the offer and reposed faith in the police.\r\n\u2026\u201D In his cross-examination, the witness stated:-\r\n\u201CI did not record the secret information in writing. Wireless in my jeep was out of\r\norder at that time. I did not obtain any search warrants for conducting the search of\r\nthe jeep of accused during night hours. I did not record any ground for not obtaining\r\nthe requisite search warrants in my police file. The writing work was done while\r\nsitting in the jeep.\u201D\r\n5. After considering the evidence on record, the Trial Court by its judgment and order dated\r\n12.08.2004, acquitted accused Major Singh but convicted accused Boota Singh, Gurdeep Singh and\r\nGurmohinder Singh, under Section 15 of the NDPS Act and sentenced them to suffer rigorous\r\nimprisonment for 10 years with imposition of fine in the sum of Rs.1,00,000\/-, in default whereof\r\nthey were directed to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years.\r\nOn the question of applicability of Section 42 of the NDPS Act, the Trial Court stated:-\r\n\u201C \u2026 Learned counsel sought acquittal of accused due to non- compliance of Section 42\r\nof N.D.P.S. Act. However, above said argument could help the accused if recovery had\r\nbeen effected from the house, building etc. of the accused. Admittedly, recovery in\r\nquestion was effected from the accused while they were sitting on road in a jeep at a\r\npublic place. Therefore, case of accused would be covered by Section 43 of N.D.P.S.\r\nAct and not by Section 42 of N.D.P.S. Act. Under these circumstances, argument of\r\nlearned counsels for accused is overruled.\u201D\r\n6. The convicted accused, being aggrieved, preferred the aforementioned Criminal Appeal before the\r\nHigh Court, which was dismissed by the High Court.\r\nOn the question whether the matter came within the scope of Section 42 of the NDPS Act, the High\r\nCourt observed:-\r\n14. Furthermore, in the case in hand, the accused were present in a jeep on a public\r\npath and in such circumstance, the provisions of Section 43 and not of 42 of the Act\r\ncome into play. As per explanation to Section 43 of the Act, the public place includes\r\na conveyance also. Section 43 of the Act contemplates a seizure made in a public\r\nplace or in transit. As such, Section 42 of the Act is not applicable to the facts of the\r\npresent case \u2026\u201D\r\n7. In this appeal preferred by Boota Singh, Gurdeep Singh and Gurmohinder Singh challenging the\r\ncorrectness of the decisions of the courts below, we heard Mr. Praveen Kumar, learned counsel for\r\nthe appellants and Mr. Rakesh Mudgal, learned AAG for the State.\r\n8. Mr. Praveen Kumar submitted inter alia:\r\na. The vehicle in question was a private vehicle belonging to accused Gurdeep Singh\r\nand was not a public conveyance, though parked on a public road.\r\nb. As accepted by PW4 Inspector Nand Lal, the secret information was not recorded\r\nin writing nor any grounds were recorded for not obtaining the requisite search\r\nwarrants.\r\nc. The instant case would not be come under Section 43 but would be governed by the\r\nprovisions of Section 42 of the NDPS Act.\r\nd. Section 42 having not been complied with at all, the appellants were entitled to\r\nacquittal in terms of law laid down in the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in\r\nKarnail Singh v. State of Haryana1, followed in subsequent decisions in Sukhdev\r\nSingh v. State of Haryana2, and, State of Rajasthan v. Jagraj Singh alias Hansa3.\r\n1(2009) 8 SCC 539 2(2013) 2 SCC 212 3(2016) 11 SCC 687\r\n9. Countering the submissions, Mr. Rakesh Mudgal, learned AAG submitted that the courts below\r\nwere right in observing that the instant case would be governed by the provisions of Section 43 of\r\nthe NDPS Act. It was however accepted by the learned counsel that there was no material on record\r\nto conclude that the vehicle in question was a public conveyance.\r\n10. In Karnail Singh , the Constitution Bench of this Court concluded:-\r\n\u201C35. In conclusion, what is to be noticed is that Abdul Rashid [(2000) 2 SCC 513 :\r\n2000 SCC (Cri) 496] did not require literal compliance with the requirements of\r\nSections 42(1) and 42(2) nor did Sajan Abraham [(2001) 6 SCC 692 :\r\n2001 SCC (Cri) 1217] hold that the requirements of Sections 42(1) and 42(2) need not\r\nbe fulfilled at all. The effect of the two decisions was as follows:\r\n(a) The officer on receiving the information [of the nature referred to in sub-section\r\n(1) of Section 42] from any person had to record it in writing in the register\r\nconcerned and forthwith send a copy to his immediate official superior, before\r\nproceeding to take action in terms of clauses (a) to\r\n(d) of Section 42(1).\r\n(b) But if the information was received when the officer was not in the police station,\r\nbut while he was on the move either on patrol duty or otherwise, either by mobile\r\nphone, or other means, and the information calls for immediate action and any delay\r\nwould have resulted in the goods or evidence being removed or destroyed, it would\r\nnot be feasible or practical to take down in writing the information given to him, in\r\nsuch a situation, he could take action as per clauses (a) to (d) of Section 42(1) and\r\nthereafter, as soon as it is practical, record the information in writing and forthwith\r\ninform the same to the official superior.\r\n(c) In other words, the compliance with the requirements of Sections 42(1) and 42(2)\r\nin regard to writing down the information received and sending a copy thereof to the\r\nsuperior officer, should normally precede the entry, search and seizure by the officer.\r\nBut in special circumstances involving emergent situations, the recording of the\r\ninformation in writing and sending a copy thereof to the official superior may get\r\npostponed by a reasonable period, that is, after the search, entry and seizure. The\r\nquestion is one of urgency and expediency.\r\n(d) While total non-compliance with requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of Section 42 is impermissible, delayed compliance with satisfactory explanation\r\nabout the delay will be acceptable compliance with Section 42. To illustrate, if any delay may result\r\nin the accused escaping or the goods or evidence being destroyed or removed, not recording in\r\nwriting the information received, before initiating action, or non-sending of a copy of such\r\ninformation to the official superior forthwith, may not be treated as violation of Section\r\n42. But if the information was received when the police officer was in the police station with\r\nsufficient time to take action, and if the police officer fails to record in writing the information\r\nreceived, or fails to send a copy thereof, to the official superior, then it will be a suspicious\r\ncircumstance being a clear violation of Section 42 of the Act. Similarly, where the police officer does\r\nnot record the information at all, and does not inform the official superior at all, then also it will be a\r\nclear violation of Section 42 of the Act. Whether there is adequate or substantial compliance with\r\nSection 42 or not is a question of fact to be decided in each case. The above position got\r\nstrengthened with the amendment to Section 42 by Act 9 of 2001.\u201D (Emphasis added)\r\n11. In Jagraj Singh alias Hansa , the facts were more or less identical.\r\nIn that case, the vehicle (as observed in para 5.3 of the decision) was not a public transport vehicle.\r\nAfter considering the relevant provisions and some of the decisions of this Court including the\r\ndecision in Karnail Singh , it was observed:-\r\n\u201C14. What Section 42(2) requires is that where an officer takes down an information\r\nin writing under sub-section (1) he shall send a copy thereof to his immediate officer\r\nsenior. The communication Ext. P-15 which was sent to the Circle Officer, Nohar was\r\nnot as per the information recorded in Ext. P-14 and Ext. P-21. Thus, no error was\r\ncommitted by the High Court in coming to the conclusion that there was breach of\r\nSection 42(2).\r\n ..... .....\r\n .....\r\n16. In this context, it is relevant to note that before the Special Judge also the breach\r\nof Sections 42(1) and 42(2) was contended on behalf of the defence. In para 12 of the\r\njudgment the Special Judge noted the above arguments of defence.\r\nHowever, the arguments based on non-compliance with Section 42(2) were brushed aside by\r\nobserving that discrepancy in Ext. P-14 and Ext. P-15 is totally due to clerical mistake and there was\r\ncompliance with Section 42(2). The Special Judge coming to compliance with the proviso to Section\r\n42(1) held that the vehicle searched was being used to transport passengers as has been clearly\r\nstated by its owner Vira Ram, hence, as per the Explanation to Section 43 of the Act, the vehicle was\r\na public transport vehicle and there was no need of any warrant or authority to search such a\r\nvehicle. The High Court has reversed the above findings of the Special Judge. We thus, proceed to\r\nexamine as to whether Section 43 was attracted in the present case which obviated the requirement\r\nof Section 42(1) proviso.\r\n ..... .....\r\n .....\r\n29. After referring to the earlier judgments, the Constitution Bench came to the conclusion that\r\nnon-compliance with requirement of Sections 42 and 50 is impermissible whereas delayed\r\ncompliance with satisfactory explanation will be acceptable compliance with Section 42. The\r\nConstitution Bench noted the effect of the aforesaid two decisions in para 5. The present is not a\r\ncase where insofar as compliance with Section 42(1) proviso even an argument based on substantial\r\ncompliance is raised there is total non-compliance with Section 42(1) proviso. As observed above,\r\nSection 43 being not attracted, search was to be conducted after complying with the provisions of\r\nSection 42. We thus, conclude that the High Court has rightly held that non-compliance with\r\nSection 42(1) and Section 42(2) were proved on the record and the High Court has not committed\r\nany error in setting aside the conviction order.\u201D (Emphasis added)\r\n12. The evidence in the present case clearly shows that the vehicle was not a public conveyance but\r\nwas a vehicle belonging to accused Gurdeep Singh. The Registration Certificate of the vehicle, which\r\nhas been placed on record also does not indicate it to be a Public Transport Vehicle. The explanation\r\nto Section 43 shows that a private vehicle would not come within the expression \u201Cpublic place\u201D as\r\nexplained in Section 43 of the NDPS Act. On the strength of the decision of this Court in Jagraj\r\nSingh alias Hansa , the relevant provision would not be Section 43 of the NDPS Act but the case\r\nwould come under Section 42 of the NDPS Act.\r\n13. It is an admitted position that there was total non-compliance of the requirements of Section 42\r\nof the NDPS Act.\r\n14. The decision of this Court in Karnail Singh as followed in Jagraj Singh alias Hansa , is absolutely\r\nclear. Total non-compliance of Section 42 is impermissible. The rigor of Section 42 may get lessened\r\nin situations dealt with in the conclusion drawn by this Court in Karnail Singh but in no case, total\r\nnon-compliance of Section 42 can be accepted.\r\n15. In the circumstances, the courts below fell in error in rejecting the submissions advanced on\r\nbehalf of the appellants. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set-aside the view taken by the High Court\r\nand acquit the appellants of the charge levelled against them. The appellants be released forthwith\r\nunless their custody is required in connection with any other offence.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..J.

          "judgement":"L. NAGESWARA RAO, J.\r\n1. The respondent requested the appellants to appoint her son in the place of his father who was\r\nmissing since 2002 which was rejected. Aggrieved thereby, the Respondent filed a writ petition in\r\nthe High Court of Jharkhand. The writ petition was allowed and the appeal filed by the appellant\r\nwas dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court. Hence this appeal.\r\n2. The husband of the respondent was an Operator, Helper Category (Category II) at Gidi Washery.\r\nThe Respondent informed the officer in-charge of Bhurkunda Thana, Hazaribagh that her husband\r\nwas missing since 03.10.2002. A copy of the 1 | Page said information was communicated to the\r\nRegional Officer of the Gidi Washery. A charge-sheet was issued by Appellant No. 1 to the\r\nRespondent\u2019s husband for desertion of duty since 01.10.2002 and an inquiry was conducted in\r\nwhich the Respondent participated on behalf of her husband. On the basis of Inquiry Officer\u2019s\r\nreport, the Appellant No. 1 terminated the services of the Respondent\u2019s husband with effect from\r\n21.09.2004\r\n3. The Respondent filed a suit in the Court of the Additional Munsif, Hazaribagh seeking a\r\ndeclaration of civil death of her missing husband. The said suit was decreed with effect from the date\r\nof filing of the suit i.e. 23.12.2009 by a judgment dated 13.07.2012. The Respondent made a\r\nrepresentation on 17.01.2013 seeking compassionate appointment for her son which was rejected on\r\n03.05.2013. The request for compassionate appointment was rejected by Appellant No. 1 on the\r\nground that the Respondent\u2019s husband was already dismissed from service and therefore, the\r\nrequest for compassionate appointment could not be entertained.\r\n4. Challenging the rejection of the request for compassionate appointment of her son, the\r\nRespondent filed a writ petition before the High Court which was allowed by a judgment dated\r\n03.08.2015. The High Court held that the proceedings leading to 2 | Page the termination of the\r\nRespondent\u2019s husband from service cannot be sustained in the eye of law. On the said basis, the\r\norder of termination of Respondent\u2019s husband from service was quashed. The rejection of the claim\r\nof compassionate appointment of her son was also quashed and the first appellant was directed to\r\nconsider the claim of compassionate appointment of the Respondent\u2019s son in accordance with law.\r\nBy an order dated 03.08.2016 the first Appellant decided that there was no merit in the request for\r\nappointment of Respondent\u2019s son. It was observed in the order of rejection dated 03.08.2016 that\r\nthe Respondent was in employment and both her sons were shown as her dependents. It was further\r\nnoted that the Respondent\u2019s husband was missing since 03.10.2002 and the Respondent\u2019s son was\r\nnot entitled to seek compassionate appointment which is normally provided as a succour to the\r\nfamily of a deceased employee in harness. Another reason given for rejecting the request for\r\ncompassionate appointment was that a decision was taken in the meeting of Directors (Personnel)\r\non 19.10.2013 that compassionate appointment cannot be provided to the dependents of missing\r\nemployees (Deemed death).\r\n5. The High Court through its judgment dated 16.08.2018 set aside the order dated 03.08.2016 by\r\nholding that the note of 3 | Page discussions of the Directors meet held at Jaipur cannot be\r\nconsidered as policy decision and it cannot be the basis for rejection of the claim for compassionate\r\nappointment. The High Court was of the view that the parties are bound by the National Coal Wage\r\nAgreement. In respect of the Respondent\u2019s employment being the reason for rejection of request for\r\ncompassionate appointment, the High Court observed that there is no policy decision of the\r\nappellant company not to offer compassionate appointment in cases of double employment. As the\r\norder of termination of services of Respondent\u2019s husband was quashed by the High Court,\r\nRespondent\u2019s son was held to be entitled for appointment. The Division Bench of the High Court\r\ndismissed the appeal filed by the appellants. The National Coal Wage Agreement was examined in\r\ndetail by the Division Bench to come to a conclusion that civil death of employee cannot be a\r\ndisqualification for compassionate appointment of the member of his family. The contention of the\r\nAppellant that the decision was taken by the Directors (Personnel) not to provide employment to the\r\nchildren of employees who have suffered civil death was not accepted by the Division Bench as it\r\ncould not be termed as a policy decision. The High Court observed that there is no delay in seeking\r\ncompassionate appointment after having obtained a decree from the Civil Court declaring the 4 |\r\nPage Respondent\u2019s husband to have suffered civil death. The Division Bench upheld the finding of\r\nthe Single Judge of the High Court that there is no clause in the National Coal Wage Agreement\r\nwhich prevents a claim for compassionate appointment on the ground that another member of the\r\nfamily is in service.\r\n6. The contention of the Appellant is that there is no right for compassionate appointment available\r\nto the surviving family members of the deceased employee in harness and one must seek\r\nappointment on compassionate basis in accordance with the relevant rules, regulations and\r\nschemes. It was submitted on behalf of the Appellants that the Respondent\u2019s husband was missing\r\nsince 2002. The suit filed by the Respondent seeking for declaration of civil death of her husband\r\nwas in 2009. The request for compassionate appointment was made much later in 2013. In view of\r\nthe delay in making a claim for compassionate appointment, the very purpose of providing\r\ncompassionate appointment owing to the death of the breadwinner is not served. In addition, the\r\nRespondent was in service of the Appellant. It was also argued that though the National Coal Wage\r\nAgreement does not contain any clause relating to the dependents of the employee who suffered civil\r\ndeath to be ineligible for compassionate appointment, the decision taken by 5 | Page the Directors\r\n(Personnel) in 2013 should be treated as a policy decision governing compassionate appointment.\r\n7. On behalf of the Respondent, it was submitted that there is no provision in the National Coal\r\nWage Agreement that a family member of an employee who suffered civil death is not eligible for\r\ncompassionate appointment. There is also no provision that the Respondent\u2019s son cannot be given\r\ncompassionate appointment on the ground that she is working in the company. The Respondent\r\nsubmitted that she was diligent in participating in the departmental inquiry initiated against her\r\nhusband and in filing the civil suit for declaration of civil death of her husband immediately on\r\ncompletion of 7 years from 2002. According to the Respondent, the order of termination of services\r\nof her husband was set aside by the High Court which has become final. In any event, the\r\nrespondent has retired from service in 2018 and her son needs the employment to take care of his\r\nfamily.\r\n8. The whole object of granting compassionate appointment is to enable the family to tide over the\r\nsudden crisis which arises due to the death of the sole breadwinner. The mere death of an employee\r\nin harness does not entitle his family to such source of livelihood. The authority concerned has to\r\nexamine the financial condition of the family of the deceased, and it is only if it is 6 | Page satisfied\r\nthat but for the provision of employment, the family will not be able to meet the crisis that the job is\r\noffered to the eligible member of the family 1. It was further asseverated in the said judgment that\r\ncompassionate employment cannot be granted after a lapse of reasonable period as the\r\nconsideration of such employment is not a vested right which can be exercised at any time in the\r\nfuture. It was further held that the object of compassionate appointment is to enable the family to\r\nget over the financial crisis that it faces at the time of the death of sole breadwinner, compassionate\r\nappointment cannot be claimed or offered after a signficant lapse of time and after the crisis is over.\r\n9. We are in agreement with the High Court that the reasons given by the employer for denying\r\ncompassionate appointment to the Respondent\u2019s son are not justified. There is no bar in the\r\nNational Coal Wage Agreement for appointment of the son of an employee who has suffered civil\r\ndeath. In addition, merely because the respondent is working, her son cannot be denied\r\ncompassionate appointment as per the relevant clauses of the National Coal Wage Agreement.\r\nHowever, the Respondent\u2019s husband is missing since 2002. Two sons of the Respondent who are the\r\ndependents of her husband as per the records, are also shown as dependents of the Respondent. It\r\ncannot be said that 1 Umesh Kumar Nagpal vs. State of Haryana, (1994) 4 SCC 138 7 | Page there\r\nwas any financial crisis created immediately after Respondent\u2019s husband went missing in view of the\r\nemployment of the Respondent. Though the reasons given by the employer to deny the relief sought\r\nby the Respondent are not sustainable, we are convinced that the Respondent\u2019s son cannot be given\r\ncompassionate appointment at this point of time. The application for compassionate appointment of\r\nthe son was filed by the Respondent in the year 2013 which is more than 10 years after the\r\nRespondent\u2019s husband had gone missing. As the object of compassionate appointment is for\r\nproviding immediate succour to the family of a deceased employee, the Respondent\u2019s son is not\r\nentitled for compassionate appointment after the passage of a long period of time since his father\r\nhas gone missing.\r\n10. For the aforementioned reasons, we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High\r\nCourt.\r\n.....................................J. [ L.

The appellants\r\nand C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.6466 of 2019 respondent nos.4 to 7 were the applicants in the application\r\nfiled under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 before the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims\r\nTribunal, Ajmer, Rajasthan (for short, \u2018the Tribunal\u2019) claiming compensation of Rs.93,08,000\/\u2212\r\nwith interest @ 15% p.a. The Tribunal by judgment dated 25.11.2017 has awarded the total\r\ncompensation of Rs.10,99,700\/\u2212 with interest @ 6% p.a. The appellant\u2212parents alone have filed\r\nappeal before the High Court. The High Court by impugned judgment dated 06.07.2018 dismissed\r\nthe appeal. As such the appellants are before this Court.\r\n4. The deceased Shivpal was employed as driver on the vehicle, i.e., truck trailer bearing No.RJ\u221206\u2212\r\nGA\u22126576. When he was driving the vehicle on 27.02.2016, within the limits of Adarsh Nagar Police\r\nStation, Ajmer, the vehicle \u2013 truck trailer \u2212 bearing no.RJ\u221214\u2212GD\u2212 1156, driven by the 1st\r\nrespondent; belonging to the 2nd respondent; and insured with the 3rd respondent, came on the\r\nwrong side and rammed into the vehicle of the deceased resulting in the accident, as a result of\r\nwhich Shivpal died in the said accident.\r\n5. It was the case of the claimants before the Tribunal that deceased Shivpal was in possession of\r\nheavy vehicle driving licence and was earning Rs.15,000\/\u2212 per month. Apart from the claim on\r\naccount of loss of dependency, they also claimed compensation on all C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.6466 of\r\n2019 other conventional heads. The Tribunal has held that accident occurred due to rash and\r\nnegligent driving of the vehicle, driven by the 1st respondent. The Tribunal by taking into account\r\nthe income of the deceased at Rs.5746\/\u2212 per month has awarded a total compensation of\r\nRs.10,99,700\/\u2212 inclusive of consortium of Rs.40000\/\u2212 to the wife and minor child. The Tribunal\r\nhad merely awarded an amount of Rs.10000\/\u2212 each to the appellant\u2212parents, of the deceased.\r\n6. We have heard Sri Aditya Singh, learned counsel for the appellants and Sri Sahil Raveen, learned\r\ncounsel for respondent no.3.\r\n7. Mainly it is contended by learned counsel for the appellants that though the deceased was earning\r\nRs.15,000\/\u2212 per month, being a heavy vehicle driver, the Tribunal has awarded compensation on\r\naccount of loss of dependency by taking the income of the deceased at Rs.5746\/\u2212 per month. It is\r\nsubmitted that wife of the deceased, i.e. respondent no.4 has clearly stated in her deposition that\r\ndeceased was earning Rs.15000\/\u2212 per month. It is submitted that inspite of such evidence on record\r\nthe Tribunal has committed error in taking the income of the deceased at Rs.5746\/\u2212 as per the\r\nminimum wage notified to the skilled labour. Further it is submitted that Tribunal has committed\r\nerror in recording a finding that the appellants are not C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.6466 of 2019 dependents\r\nas they were living separately. Lastly it is submitted that appellants are also entitled to\r\ncompensation under the head of \u2018loss of consortium\u2019.\r\n8. The learned counsel appearing for the 3 rd respondent has submitted that in absence of any\r\ndocumentary evidence on record to show the salary of the deceased at Rs.15,000\/\u2212 per month the\r\nTribunal has correctly taken into account the monthly earnings of the deceased at Rs.5746\/\u2212. By\r\nrelying on a judgment of this Court in the case of Kirti & Anr. v. Oriental Insurance Company\r\nLimited1, learned counsel has submitted that there are no grounds to interfere with the impugned\r\njudgment of the High Court.\r\n9. Having heard the learned counsels on both sides, we have perused the impugned order and other\r\nmaterial placed on record. At the outset, we may note that the High Court by a cryptic order\r\ndismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants without considering the various grounds raised in\r\nthe appeal.\r\n10. It is the specific case of the claimants that the deceased was possessing heavy vehicle driving\r\nlicence and was earning Rs.15000\/\u2212 per month. Possessing such licence and driving of heavy vehicle\r\non the date of accident is proved from the evidence on record. 1 (2021) 2 SCC 166\r\nC.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.6466 of 2019 Though the wife of the deceased has categorically deposed as AW\u22121\r\nthat her husband Shivpal was earning Rs.15000\/\u2212 per month, same was not considered only on the\r\nground that salary certificate was not filed. The Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of the\r\ndeceased by adopting minimum wage notified for the skilled labour in the year 2016. In absence of\r\nsalary certificate the minimum wage notification can be a yardstick but at the same time cannot be\r\nan absolute one to fix the income of the deceased. In absence of documentary evidence on record\r\nsome amount of guesswork is required to be done. But at the same time the guesswork for assessing\r\nthe income of the deceased should not be totally detached from reality. Merely because claimants\r\nwere unable to produce documentary evidence to show the monthly income of Shivpal, same does\r\nnot justify adoption of lowest tier of minimum wage while computing the income. There is no reason\r\nto discard the oral evidence of the wife of the deceased who has deposed that late Shivpal was\r\nearning around Rs.15000\/\u2212 per month. In the case of Minu Rout & Anr. v. Satya Pradyumna\r\nMohapatra & Ors.2 this Court while dealing with the claim relating to an accident which occurred on\r\n08.11.2004 has taken the salary of the driver of light motor vehicle at Rs.6000\/\u2212 per month. In this\r\ncase the accident was 2 (2013) 10 SCC 695 C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.6466 of 2019 on 27.02.2016 and it is\r\nclearly proved that the deceased was in possession of heavy vehicle driving licence and was driving\r\nsuch vehicle on the day of accident. Keeping in mind the enormous growth of vehicle population and\r\ndemand for good drivers and by considering oral evidence on record we may take the income of the\r\ndeceased at Rs.8000\/\u2212 per month for the purpose of loss of dependency. Deceased was aged about\r\n32 years on the date of the accident and as he was on fixed salary, 40% enhancement is to be made\r\ntowards loss of future prospects. At the same time deduction of 1\/3 rd is to be made from the income\r\nof the deceased towards his personal expenses. Accordingly the income of the deceased can be\r\narrived at Rs.7467\/\u2212 per month. By applying the multiplier of \u201816\u2019 the claimants are entitled for\r\ncompensation of Rs.14,33,664\/\u2212. As an amount of Rs.10,99,700\/\u2212 is already paid towards the loss\r\nof dependency the appellant\u2212parents are entitled for differential compensation of Rs.3,33,964\/\u2212.\r\nFurther in view of the judgment of this Court in the case of Magma General Insurance Company\r\nLimited v. Nanu Ram @ Chuhru Ram & Ors.3 the appellants are also entitled for parental\r\nconsortium of Rs.40,000\/\u2212 each. The finding of the Tribunal that parents cannot be treated as\r\ndependents runs contrary to the judgment of this Court in the case of 3 2018 SCC OnLine SC 1546 =\r\n(2018) 18 SCC 130 C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.6466 of 2019 Sarla Verma (Smt). & Ors. v. Delhi Transport\r\nCorporation & Anr.4. The judgment in the case of Kirti & Anr. v. Oriental Insurance Company\r\nLimited1 relied on by the counsel for the respondent would not render any assistance in support of\r\nhis case having regard to facts of the case and the evidence on record.\r\n11. For the aforesaid reasons this appeal is allowed and appellants are entitled for further\r\ncompensation amount of Rs.3,33,964\/\u2212 on account of loss of dependency and consortium amount\r\nof Rs.40,000\/\u2212 each. Thus total compensation payable to the appellants is fixed at Rs.4,13,964\/\u2212\r\nwith interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of claim petition.\r\n12. For the aforesaid reasons the appeal is partly allowed, with no order as to costs.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J. [R.

          "judgement":"L. NAGESWARA RAO, J.\r\nFor the sake of convenience, we are referring to the facts of Civil Appeal No.1328 of 2021.\r\nCivil Appeal No. 1328 of 2021\r\n1. By an order of assessment dated 31.01.2005, the Assessing Officer restricted the eligible deduction\r\nunder Section 80-IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter \u201Cthe Act\u201D) to the extent of \u2018business\r\nincome\u2019 only. On 23.03.2006, the Commissioner of Income-Tax (Appeal)-I (hereinafter \u201Cthe\r\nAppellate Authority\u201D) partly allowed the Appeal filed by the Assessee and reversed the order of the\r\nAssessing Officer on 1 | Page the issue of the extent of deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act. The\r\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter \u201Cthe Tribunal\u201D), upheld the decision of the Appellate\r\nAuthority on the issue of deduction under Section 80-IA. The High Court refused to interfere with\r\nthe Tribunal\u2019s order as far as the issue on deduction under Section 80-IA is concerned. Therefore,\r\nthis Appeal by the Revenue.\r\n2. This Appeal pertains to the assessment year 2002-03 for which the income-tax return was filed by\r\nthe Assessee on 31.10.2002 declaring the total income as \u2018NIL\u2019. The return was subsequently revised\r\non 06.12.2002 and thereafter, on 30.03.2004. At the time of the assessment proceedings, the\r\nAssessee submitted a revised computation of income by revising its claim of deduction under\r\nSection 80-IA of the Act.\r\n3. The Assessee is in the business of generation of power and also deals with purchase and\r\ndistribution of power. The Assessee-Company generated power from its power unit located at\r\nDahanu. In respect of deduction under Section 80- IA of the Act, the Assessee was asked to explain\r\nas to why the deduction should not be restricted to business income, as had been the stand of the\r\nRevenue for the assessment year 2000-01. The Assessee had revised its claim under Section 80-IA\r\nof the Act to Rs. 546,26,01,224\/-, having admitted that there was an error in calculation of\r\nincome-tax depreciation.\r\n2 | Page The Assessing Officer considered the revised claim of the Assessee under Section 80-IA and\r\ndetermined the amount eligible for deduction under Section 80-IA at Rs. 492,78,60,973\/- against\r\nthe Assessee\u2019s claim of Rs. 546,26,01,224\/-. However, the Assessing Officer stated in the assessment\r\norder that the actual deduction allowable shall be to the extent of \u2018income from business\u2019 as per\r\nprovisions of Section 80AB of the Act. The \u2018business income\u2019 of the Assessee was computed at Rs.\r\n355,74,73,451\/- and the \u2018gross total income\u2019 at Rs. 397,37,70,178\/-. Inclusion of \u2018income from other\r\nsources\u2019 of Rs. 41,62,96,727\/- in the \u2018gross total income\u2019 and deduction claimed under Chapter VI- A\r\nof the Act against such \u2018gross total income\u2019 was not accepted by the Assessing Officer. The Assessing\r\nOfficer rejected the claim of the Assessee for allowing deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act,\r\nalong with other deductions available to the Assessee, to the extent of \u2018gross total income\u2019 and\r\nrestricted the deduction allowed under Section 80-IA at Rs.354,00,75,084\/-, by limiting the\r\naggregate of deductions under Sections 80-IA and 80-IB of the Act to \u2018business income\u2019 of the\r\nAssessee.\r\n4. The Assessing Officer rejected the contention of the Assessee that Section 80AB of the Act is not\r\napplicable. It was held that Section 80AB of the Act makes it clear that for 3 | Page the purposes of\r\ndeduction in respect of certain incomes, deduction had to be given on the income of the nature\r\nspecified in the relevant section and allowed against income of that nature alone. The Assessing\r\nOfficer elaborated on this point by stating that \u2018income from business\u2019 alone had to be considered\r\nfor allowing any deduction computed on \u2018income from business\u2019 and using the same analogy,\r\ndeduction computed on \u2018income from other sources\u2019 should be allowable against \u2018income from other\r\nsources\u2019 only. As the deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act pertains to profits and gains from a\r\nbusiness undertaking, the deduction is allowable only against \u2018income from business\u2019. It was held by\r\nthe Assessing Officer that deduction computed under Section 80-IA of the Act could not be allowed\r\nagainst any source other than business. The Assessing Officer also relied upon the words \u2018that\r\nnature\u2019 and \u2018shall alone\u2019 in Section 80AB of the Act to hold that deduction under a relevant section\r\nhas to be given to the extent of the income from that particular source only on which deduction is\r\navailable. In the matter before us, this would mean that deduction under Section 80- IA of the Act\r\nhas to be allowed only to the extent of \u2018income from business\u2019.\r\n5. It was argued by the Assessee before the Appellate Authority that the conclusion of the Assessing\r\nOfficer on 4 | Page deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act being restricted to \u2018business income\u2019\r\nneeds to be set aside. The Assessee contended that the observation of the Assessing Officer that\r\ndeduction under a particular section is permissible only against income under that particular head\r\nwas erroneous. Deductions related to various incomes under various sections of Chapter VI-A have\r\nto be quantified in accordance with the respective sections. The Assessee urged before the Appellate\r\nAuthority that the deductions so quantified under various sections under Chapter VI-A have to be\r\naggregated and allowed against the \u2018gross total income\u2019. Finally, the submission of the Assessee\r\nbefore the Appellate Authority was that restricting the deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act to\r\nthe extent of \u2018business income\u2019 was unjustified. With reference to Section 80AB, the Assessee\r\ncontended that the operation of the said section related only to quantification of deduction on the\r\nbasis of net income.\r\n6. The Appellate Authority partly allowed the Appeal filed by the Assessee by an order dated\r\n23.03.2006 and reversed the finding of the Assessing Officer on the issue of deduction under\r\nSection 80-IA of the Act for the reasons stated hereinafter. In respect of Section 80AB of the Act, the\r\nAppellate Authority referred to the background of insertion of the said section with effect from\r\n01.04.1981. The Appellate 5 | Page Authority referred to Circular No. 281 dated 22.09.1980 of the\r\nCentral Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) wherein the reason for introduction of Section 80AB was\r\nexplained. The Supreme Court in the case of Cloth Traders (P) Ltd. v. Additional CIT, Gujarat-I1\r\nheld that deduction under Section 80M of the Act, which deals with deduction in respect of certain\r\ninter-corporate dividends, was allowable on the gross amount of the dividends received. It was\r\ndecided to undo the decision of this Court as it was contrary to the legislative intent, which was that\r\ndeduction under Section 80M was to be allowed on the dividend income as computed under the Act,\r\ni.e., on the net income after deduction of admissible expenses. The Appellate Authority proceeded to\r\nhold that Section 80AB places a ceiling on the quantum of deductions in respect of incomes\r\ncontained in Part-C of Chapter VI-A. Such deductions are to be computed on the net eligible income,\r\nwhich will be deemed to be included in the gross total income. The Appellate Authority observed\r\nthat Section 80AB is limited to determining the quantum of deductible income included in the gross\r\ntotal income. Following a decision of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai dated 25.04.2003\r\nin Royal Cushion Vinyl Products Ltd. v. Dy. Commissioner of Income Tax, 1 (1979) 3 SCC 538 6 |\r\nPage Mumbai (ITA No. 770\/MUM\/98), the Appellate Authority set aside the order of the Assessing\r\nOfficer on this count. The Appellate Authority directed the Assessing Officer not to restrict the\r\ndeduction admissible under Section 80-IA of the Act to income under the head \u2018business\u2019. The\r\nAssessing Officer was further directed to aggregate the deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act\r\nwith the other deductions available to the Assessee and then to allow deductions of such aggregate\r\namount to the extent of \u2018gross total income\u2019. The order of the Appellate Authority was affirmed by\r\nthe Tribunal and the High Court on this issue. Aggrieved thereby, the Revenue has come in Appeal.\r\n7. The contention on behalf of the Revenue before us is that the Assessing Officer was right in\r\nholding that the deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act should be restricted to \u2018business income\u2019\r\nonly. Mr. Arijit Prasad, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue, submitted that\r\nSection 80AB of the Act contemplates deductions in respect of incomes against income of the nature\r\nspecified in the relevant section. He further submitted that Section 80-IA(5) makes it clear that the\r\ndetermination of quantum of deduction under sub-section (1) of Section 80-IA should be on the\r\nbasis that the source of income from the eligible business was the only source of income of an\r\nassessee and 7 | Page therefore, the deduction so determined should be allowed only against\r\n\u2018business income\u2019. According to him, the phrase \u2018derived \u2026 from\u2019 in sub-section (1) of Section 80-IA\r\nof the Act indicates that the computation of deduction is restricted only to the profits and gains from\r\nthe eligible business. He relied upon the judgment of this Court in Cambay Electric Supply\r\nIndustrial Co. Ltd. v. CIT 2, followed in Synco Industries Ltd. v. Assessing Officer, Income Tax,\r\nMumbai & Anr. 3 and Pandian Chemicals Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madurai4.\r\n8. In response, the Assessee supported the order passed by the Appellate Authority which was\r\nupheld by the Tribunal and the High Court. It is the argument of Mr. Ajay Vohra, learned Senior\r\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the Assessee, that Section 80AB of the Act is with reference to\r\ncomputation of deduction on the basis of net income. He submitted that there is no indication in\r\nsub-section (5) of Section 80-IA that the deduction under sub-section (1) is restricted to \u2018business\r\nincome\u2019 only. On the other hand, according to him, sub- section (5) deals with determination of the\r\nquantum of deduction by treating eligible business as the only source of income of the Assessee.\r\nSub-section (5), therefore, is 2 (1978) 2 SCC 644 3 (2008) 4 SCC 22 4 (2003) 5 SCC 590 8 | Page\r\nconcerned with computation of the deduction, which is at a stage prior to allowing the deduction so\r\ncomputed. He submitted that there is no dispute that the computation of deduction is only from the\r\neligible business. The claim of the Assessee, as accepted by the Appellate Authority, is that there is\r\nno restriction on taking into account income from any other source while allowing the deduction\r\ncomputed under Section 80-IA, subject to the aggregate of all deductions under Chapter VI-A not\r\nexceeding the \u2018gross total income\u2019. He relied upon judgments of this Court in CIT (Central), Madras\r\nv. Canara Workshops (P) Ltd., Kodialball, Mangalore5 and Synco Industries (supra) to argue that\r\nsub-section (5) of Section 80-IA of the Act does not restrict permissible deduction under sub-section\r\n(1) to be allowed against \u2018business income\u2019 only. The learned Senior Counsel for the Assessee relied\r\nupon the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Tridoss\r\nLaboratories Ltd.6 to argue that the Appeal should not be allowed.\r\n9. The controversy in this case pertains to the deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act being\r\nallowed to the extent of \u2018business income\u2019 only. The claim of the Assessee that deduction under\r\nSection 80-IA should be allowed to the 5 (1986) 3 SCC 538 6 [2010] 328 ITR 448 (Bombay) 9 | Page\r\nextent of \u2018gross total income\u2019 was rejected by the Assessing Officer. It is relevant to reproduce\r\nSection 80AB of the Act which is as follows:\r\n\u201C80AB. Deductions to be made with reference to the income included in the gross\r\ntotal income. \u2014 Where any deduction is required to be made or allowed under any\r\nsection included in this Chapter under the heading \u201CC. \u2014 Deductions in respect of\r\ncertain incomes\u201D in respect of any income of the nature specified in that section\r\nwhich is included in the gross total income of the assessee, then, notwithstanding\r\nanything contained in that section, for the purpose of computing the deduction under\r\nthat section, the amount of income of that nature as computed in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of this Act (before making any deduction under this Chapter) shall alone\r\nbe deemed to be the amount of income of that nature which is derived or received by\r\nthe assessee and which is included in his gross total income.\u201D As stated above, Section\r\n80AB was inserted in the year 1981 to get over a judgment of this Court in Cloth\r\nTraders (P) Ltd. (supra). The Circular dated 22.09.1980 issued by the CBDT makes it\r\nclear that the reason for introduction of Section 80AB of the Act was for the\r\ndeductions under Part C of Chapter VI-A of the Act to be made on the net income of\r\nthe eligible business and not on the total profits from the eligible business. A plain\r\nreading of Section 80AB of the Act\r\n10 | P a g e shows that the provision pertains to determination of the quantum of deductible income\r\nin the \u2018gross total income\u2019. Section 80AB cannot be read to be curtailing the width of Section 80-IA.\r\nIt is relevant to take note of Section 80A(1) which stipulates that in computation of the \u2018total income\u2019\r\nof an assessee, deductions specified in Section 80C to Section 80U of the Act shall be allowed from\r\nhis \u2018gross total income\u2019. Sub-section (2) of Section 80A of the Act provides that the aggregate\r\namount of the deductions under Chapter VI-A shall not exceed the \u2018gross total income\u2019 of the\r\nAssessee. We are in agreement with the Appellate Authority that Section 80AB of the Act which\r\ndeals with determination of deductions under Part C of Chapter VI-A is with respect only to\r\ncomputation of deduction on the basis of \u2018net income\u2019.\r\n10. Sub-section (1) and sub-section (5) of Section 80-IA which are relevant for these Appeals are as\r\nunder:\r\n\u201C80-IA. Deductions in respect of profits and gains from industrial undertakings or\r\nenterprises engaged in infrastructure development, etc.\u2014 (1) Where the gross total\r\nincome of an assessee includes any profits and gains derived by an undertaking or an\r\nenterprise from any business referred to in sub-section (4) (such business being\r\nhereinafter referred to as the eligible business), there shall, in accordance with and\r\nsubject to the provisions of this section, be allowed, in computing\r\n11 | P a g e the total income of the assessee, a deduction of an amount equal to hundred per cent. of\r\nthe profits and gains derived from such business for ten consecutive assessment years.\r\n**** (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act, the profits and gains\r\nof an eligible business to which the provisions of sub- section (1) apply shall, for the purposes of\r\ndetermining the quantum of deduction under that sub-section for the assessment year immediately\r\nsucceeding the initial assessment year or any subsequent assessment year, be computed as if such\r\neligible business were the only source of income of the assessee during the previous year relevant to\r\nthe initial assessment year and to every subsequent assessment year up to and including the\r\nassessment year for which the determination is to be made.\u201D\r\n11. The essential ingredients of Section 80-IA (1) of the Act are:\r\na) the \u2018gross total income\u2019 of an assessee should include profits and gains;\r\nb) those profits and gains are derived by an undertaking or an enterprise from a\r\nbusiness referred to in subsection (4);\r\nc) the assessee is entitled for deduction of an amount equal to 100% of the profits and\r\ngains derived from such business for 10 consecutive assessment years; and\r\nd) in computing the \u2018total income\u2019 of the Assessee, such deduction shall be allowed.\r\n12 | P a g e\r\n12. The import of Section 80-IA is that the \u2018total income\u2019 of an assessee is computed by taking into\r\naccount the allowable deduction of the profits and gains derived from the \u2018eligible business\u2019. With\r\nrespect to the facts of this Appeal, there is no dispute that the deduction quantified under Section\r\n80-IA is Rs.492,78,60,973\/-. To make it clear, the said amount represents the net profit made by the\r\nAssessee from the \u2018eligible business\u2019 covered under sub-section (4), i.e., from the Assessee\u2019s business\r\nunit involved in generation of power. The claim of the Assessee is that in computing its \u2018total\r\nincome\u2019, deductions available to it have to be set-off against the \u2018gross total income\u2019, while the\r\nRevenue contends that it is only the \u2018business income\u2019 which has to be taken into account for the\r\npurpose of setting-off the deductions under Sections 80-IA and 80-IB of the Act. To illustrate, the\r\n\u2018gross total income\u2019 of the Assessee for the assessment year 2002-03 is less than the quantum of\r\ndeduction determined under Section 80-IA of the Act. The Assessee contends that income from all\r\nother heads including \u2018income from other sources\u2019, in addition to \u2018business income\u2019, have to be taken\r\ninto account for the purpose of allowing the deductions available to the Assessee, subject to the\r\nceiling of \u2018gross total income\u2019. The Appellate Authority was of the view that 13 | P a g e there is no\r\nlimitation on deduction admissible under Section 80-IA of the Act to income under the head\r\n\u2018business\u2019 only, with which we agree.\r\n13. The other contention of the Revenue is that sub-section (5) of Section 80-IA refers to\r\ncomputation of quantum of deduction being limited from \u2018eligible business\u2019 by taking it as the only\r\nsource of income. It is contended that the language of sub-section (5) makes it clear that deduction\r\ncontemplated in sub-section (1) is only with respect to the income from \u2018eligible business\u2019 which\r\nindicates that there is a cap in sub-section (1) that the deduction cannot exceed the \u2018business\r\nincome\u2019. On the other hand, it is the case of the Assessee that sub-section (5) pertains only to\r\ndetermination of the quantum of deduction under sub-section (1) by treating the \u2018eligible business\u2019\r\nas the only source of income. It was submitted by Mr. Vohra, learned Senior Counsel, that the final\r\ncomputation of deduction under Section 80-IA for the assessment year 2002-03 as accepted by the\r\nAssessing Officer, was arrived at by taking into account the profits from the \u2018eligible business\u2019 as the\r\n\u2018only source of income\u2019. He submitted that, however, sub-section (5) is a step antecedent to the\r\ntreatment to be given to the deduction under sub- section (1) and is not concerned with the extent to\r\nwhich the computed deduction be allowed. To explain the interplay 14 | P a g e between sub-section\r\n(5) and sub-section (1) of Section 80-IA, it will be useful to refer to the facts of this Appeal. The\r\namount of deduction from the \u2018eligible business\u2019 computed under Section 80-IA for the assessment\r\nyear 2002-03 is Rs. 492,78,60,973 \/-. There is no dispute that the said amount represents income\r\nfrom the \u2018eligible business\u2019 under Section 80-IA and is the only source of income for the purposes of\r\ncomputing deduction under Section 80-IA. The question that arises further with reference to\r\nallowing the deduction so computed to arrive at the \u2018total income\u2019 of the Assessee cannot be\r\ndetermined by resorting to interpretation of sub- section (5).\r\n14. It will be useful to refer to the judgment of this Court relied upon by the Revenue as well as the\r\nAssessee. In Synco Industries (supra), this Court was concerned with Section 80-I of the Act.\r\nSection 80-I(6), which is in pari materia to Section 80-IA(5), is as follows:\r\n\u201C 80-I(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act, the\r\nprofits and gains of an industrial undertaking or a ship or the business of a hotel or\r\nthe business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft to which the\r\nprovisions of sub-section (1) apply shall, for the purposes of determining the\r\nquantum of deduction under sub- section (1) for the assessment year immediately\r\nsucceeding the initial assessment year or any\r\n15 | P a g e subsequent assessment year, be computed as if such industrial undertaking or ship or the\r\nbusiness of the hotel or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft were\r\nthe only source of income of the assessee during the previous years relevant to the initial assessment\r\nyear and to every subsequent assessment year up to and including the assessment year for which the\r\ndetermination is to be made.\u201D It was held in Synco Industries (supra) that for the purpose of\r\ncalculating the deduction under Section 80-I, loss sustained in other divisions or units cannot be\r\ntaken into account as sub-section (6) contemplates that only profits from the industrial undertaking\r\nshall be taken into account as it was the only source of income. Further, the Court concluded that\r\nSection 80-I(6) of the Act dealt with actual computation of deduction whereas Section 80-I(1) of the\r\nAct dealt with the treatment to be given to such deductions in order to arrive at the total income of\r\nthe assessee. The Assessee also relied on the judgment of this Court in Canara Workshops (P) Ltd.,\r\nKodialball, Mangalore (supra) to emphasize the purpose of sub-section (5) of Section 80-IA. In this\r\ncase, the question that arose for consideration before this Court related to computation of the profits\r\nfor the purpose of deduction under Section 80-E, as it then existed, after setting off the loss incurred\r\nby the assessee in the 16 | P a g e manufacture of alloy steels. Section 80-E of the Act, as it then\r\nexisted, permitted deductions in respect of profits and gains attributable to the business of\r\ngeneration or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction, manufacture\r\nor production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule. It\r\nwas argued on behalf of the Revenue that the profits from the automobile ancillaries industry of the\r\nassessee must be reduced by the loss suffered by the assessee in the manufacture of alloy steels. This\r\nCourt was not in agreement with the submissions made by the Revenue. It was held that the profits\r\nand gains by an industry entitled to benefit under Section 80-E cannot be reduced by the loss\r\nsuffered by any other industry or industries owned by the assessee.\r\n15. In the case before us, there is no discussion about Section 80-IA(5) by the Appellate Authority,\r\nnor the Tribunal and the High Court. However, we have considered the submissions on behalf of the\r\nRevenue as it has a bearing on the interpretation of sub-section (1) of Section 80-IA of the Act. We\r\nhold that the scope of sub-section (5) of Section 80- IA of the Act is limited to determination of\r\nquantum of deduction under sub-section (1) of Section 80-IA of the Act by treating \u2018eligible\r\nbusiness\u2019 as the \u2018only source of income\u2019.\r\n17 | P a g e Sub-section (5) cannot be pressed into service for reading a limitation of the deduction\r\nunder sub-section (1) only to \u2018business income\u2019. An attempt was made by the learned Senior Counsel\r\nfor the Revenue to rely on the phrase \u2018derived \u2026 from\u2019 in Section 80-IA (1) of the Act in respect of\r\nhis submission that the intention of the legislature was to give the narrowest possible construction\r\nto deduction admissible under this sub-section. It is not necessary for us to deal with this\r\nsubmission in view of the findings recorded above. For the aforementioned reasons, the Appeal is\r\ndismissed qua the issue of the extent of deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act.\r\nCivil Appeal No. 1327 of 2021, Civil Appeal No. 1329 of 2021, Civil Appeal No. 2537 of 2016, Civil\r\nAppeal No. 1408 of 2021 and Civil Appeal No. 1508 of 2021 are disposed of in terms of the above\r\njudgment.\r\nCivil Appeal No. 1509 of 2021 is de-tagged as the questions arising therein are not related to the\r\naforementioned issue.\r\n.....................................J.

          "judgement":"M.R. SHAH, J.\r\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order dated\r\n08.08.2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No. 1432\/2017 and\r\nWrit Petition No. 1406\/2017, by which the High Court has dismissed the aforesaid writ petitions\r\npreferred by the Commissioner of Income Tax (IT-4), Mumbai (hereinafter referred to as the\r\n\u2018Revenue\u2019) and has confirmed the order passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bench at\r\nMumbai (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018ITAT\u2019) dated 18.11.2016 passed in Miscellaneous Application\r\nNos. 261\/M\/2014 and 419\/M\/2013, by which the ITAT in exercise of powers under Section 254(2)\r\nof the Income Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Act\u2019) has recalled its earlier order dated\r\n06.09.2013 passed in ITA No. 5096\/Mum\/2008 and ITA No. 837\/Mum\/2007, the Revenue has\r\npreferred the present appeals.\r\n2. The facts leading to the present appeals in a nutshell are as under. For the sake of convenience,\r\nthe facts in Civil Appeal No. 7110 of 2021 arising from Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.13963\/2018\r\nin the case of M\/s Reliance Telecom Limited (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Assessee\u2019) are narrated.\r\nThe facts in another appeal are similar except that the assessee is different, but with respect to same\r\ngroup of companies. 2.1 That the Assessee entered into Supply Contract dated 15.06.2004 with\r\nEricsson A.B. Assessee filed an application under Section 195(2) of the Act before the Assessing\r\nOfficer, to make payment to the non- resident company for purchase of software without TDS. It\r\nwas contended by the Assessee that it was for the purchase of software and Ericsson A.B. had no\r\npermanent establishment in India and in terms of the DTAA between India and Sweden & USA, the\r\namount paid is not taxable in India.\r\n2.2 The Assessing Officer passed an order dated 12.03.2007 rejecting the Assessee\u2019s application\r\nholding that the consideration for software licensing constituted under Section 9(1)(vi) of the Act\r\nand under Article 12(3) of the DTAA is liable to be taxed in India and accordingly directed the\r\nassessee to deduct tax at the rate of 10% as royalty. 2.3 The Assessee after deducting the tax\r\nappealed before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). CIT vide order dated 27.05.2008 held\r\nin favour of the Assessee. Revenue appealed before the ITAT and by a detailed judgment and order\r\ndated 06.09.2013, the ITAT allowed the Revenue\u2019s appeal by relying upon the judgments\/decisions\r\nof the Karnataka High Court and held that payments made for purchase of software are in the\r\nnature of royalty. Against the detailed judgment and order dated 06.09.2013 passed by the ITAT,\r\nthe Assessee filed miscellaneous application for rectification under Section 254(2) of the Act.\r\nSimultaneously, the Assessee also filed the appeal before the High Court against the ITAT order\r\ndated 06.09.2013.\r\n2.4 That vide common order dated 18.11.2016, the ITAT allowed the Assessee\u2019s miscellaneous\r\napplication filed under Section 254(2) of the Act and recalled its original order dated 06.09.2013.\r\nImmediately, on passing the order dated 18.11.2016 by the ITAT recalling its earlier order dated\r\n06.09.2013, the Assessee withdrew the appeal preferred before the High court, which was against\r\nthe original order dated 06.09.2013. 2.5 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by\r\nthe ITAT allowing the miscellaneous application under Section 254(2) of the Act and recalling its\r\nearlier order dated 06.09.2013, the Revenue preferred writ petition before the High Court. By the\r\nimpugned common judgment and order, the High Court has dismissed the said writ petition\/s.\r\nHence, the Revenue is before this Court by way of present appeal\/s.\r\n3. We have heard Shri Balbir Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General of India appearing on\r\nbehalf of the Revenue and Shri Anuj Berry, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Resolution\r\nProfessional of the respondent-company. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the\r\nrespondent-company\/companies \u2013 respective assessees currently are undergoing corporate\r\ninsolvency resolution process and the Resolution Professional is appointed. We have heard learned\r\ncounsel for the Resolution Professional of the respondent- assessee.\r\n3.1 We have considered the order dated 18.11.2016 passed by the ITAT allowing the miscellaneous\r\napplication in exercise of powers under Section 254(2) of the Act and recalling its earlier order dated\r\n06.09.2013 as well as the original order passed by the ITAT dated 06.09.2013. 3.2 Having gone\r\nthrough both the orders passed by the ITAT, we are of the opinion that the order passed by the ITAT\r\ndated 18.11.2016 recalling its earlier order dated 06.09.2013 is beyond the scope and ambit of the\r\npowers under Section 254(2) of the Act. While allowing the application under Section 254(2) of the\r\nAct and recalling its earlier order dated 06.09.2013, it appears that the ITAT has re-heard the entire\r\nappeal on merits as if the ITAT was deciding the appeal against the order passed by the C.I.T. In\r\nexercise of powers under Section 254(2) of the Act, the Appellate Tribunal may amend any order\r\npassed by it under sub-section (1) of Section 254 of the Act with a view to rectifying any mistake\r\napparent from the record only. Therefore, the powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are akin to\r\nOrder XLVII Rule 1 CPC. While considering the application under Section 254(2) of the Act, the\r\nAppellate Tribunal is not required to re-visit its earlier order and to go into detail on merits. The\r\npowers under Section 254(2) of the Act are only to rectify\/correct any mistake apparent from the\r\nrecord.\r\n4. In the present case, a detailed order was passed by the ITAT when it passed an order on\r\n06.09.2013, by which the ITAT held in favour of the Revenue. Therefore, the said order could not\r\nhave been recalled by the Appellate Tribunal in exercise of powers under Section 254(2) of the Act.\r\nIf the Assessee was of the opinion that the order passed by the ITAT was erroneous, either on facts\r\nor in law, in that case, the only remedy available to the Assessee was to prefer the appeal before the\r\nHigh Court, which as such was already filed by the Assessee before the High Court, which the\r\nAssessee withdrew after the order passed by the ITAT dated 18.11.2016 recalling its earlier order\r\ndated 06.09.2013. Therefore, as such, the order passed by the ITAT recalling its earlier order dated\r\n06.09.2013 which has been passed in exercise of powers under Section 254(2) of the Act is beyond\r\nthe scope and ambit of the powers of the Appellate Tribunal conferred under Section 254 (2) of the\r\nAct. Therefore, the order passed by the ITAT dated 18.11.2016 recalling its earlier order dated\r\n06.09.2013 is unsustainable, which ought to have been set aside by the High Court.\r\n5. From the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that the High Court\r\nhas dismissed the writ petitions by observing that (i) the Revenue itself had in detail gone into\r\nmerits of the case before the ITAT and the parties filed detailed submissions based on which the\r\nITAT passed its order recalling its earlier order; (ii) the Revenue had not contended that the ITAT\r\nhad become functus officio after delivering its original order and that if it had to relook\/revisit the\r\norder, it must be for limited purpose as permitted by Section 254(2) of the Act; and (iii) that the\r\nmerits might have been decided erroneously but ITAT had the jurisdiction and within its powers it\r\nmay pass an erroneous order and that such objections had not been raised before ITAT.\r\n6. None of the aforesaid grounds are tenable in law. Merely because the Revenue might have in\r\ndetail gone into the merits of the case before the ITAT and merely because the parties might have\r\nfiled detailed submissions, it does not confer jurisdiction upon the ITAT to pass the order de hors\r\nSection 254(2) of the Act. As observed hereinabove, the powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are\r\nonly to correct and\/or rectify the mistake apparent from the record and not beyond that.\r\nEven the observations that the merits might have been decided erroneously and the ITAT had\r\njurisdiction and within its powers it may pass an order recalling its earlier order which is an\r\nerroneous order, cannot be accepted. As observed hereinabove, if the order passed by the ITAT was\r\nerroneous on merits, in that case, the remedy available to the Assessee was to prefer an appeal\r\nbefore the High Court, which in fact was filed by the Assessee before the High Court, but later on the\r\nAssessee withdrew the same in the instant case.\r\n7. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned common judgment and order\r\npassed by the High Court as well as the common order passed by the ITAT dated 18.11.2016\r\nrecalling its earlier order dated 06.09.2013 deserve to be quashed and set aside and are accordingly\r\nquashed and set aside. The original orders passed by the ITAT dated 06.09.2013 passed in the\r\nrespective appeals preferred by the Revenue are hereby restored.\r\n8. Considering the fact that the Assessee had earlier preferred appeal\/s before the High Court\r\nchallenging the original order passed by the ITAT dated 06.09.2013, which the Assessee withdrew in\r\nview of the subsequent order passed by the ITAT dated 18.11.2016 recalling its earlier order dated\r\n06.09.2013, we observe that if the Assessee\/s prefers\/prefer appeal\/s before the High Court against\r\nthe original order dated 06.09.2013 within a period of six weeks from today, the same may be\r\ndecided and disposed of in accordance with law and on its\/their own merits and without raising any\r\nobjection with respect to limitation.\r\n9. Both the appeals are accordingly allowed in the aforesaid terms. However, there shall be no order\r\nas to costs.\r\n",

          "judgement":"S. ABDUL NAZEER, J.\r\n1. Leave granted.\r\n2. This appeal is directed against the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and\r\nHaryana at Chandigarh challenging the order dated 22.02.2007 passed in CWP No. 20630 of 2006\r\nin Suman Lata and Ors. vs. State of Haryana and Ors.\r\n3. The appellants herein were impleaded as respondents before the High Court as the outcome of\r\nthe result of the said writ petition was likely to affect their service career. Respondent nos. 1 to 3\r\nherein, namely, The State of Haryana, Director, School Education, Haryana and Haryana Staff\r\nSelection Commission were arrayed as respondent nos. 1 to 3 in the writ petition. Most of the private\r\nrespondents in this appeal were writ petitioners before the High Court and some of the respondents\r\nherein are interveners. For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to in their respective\r\nranking before the High Court.\r\n4. The dispute draws its genesis from the advertisement No.6\/2006, dated 20.07.2006\r\n(Annexure-P8) which was issued by the Haryana State Staff Selection Commission (for short,\r\n\u2018Commission\u2019) inviting applications to fill up 816 posts of Arts and Crafts teachers in the State of\r\nHaryana. The eligibility criteria for the same amongst others was as under:\r\n\u201C(i) Matric from Haryana School Education Board or an equivalent qualification\r\nrecognized by the Haryana School Education Board.\r\n(ii) Two year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana\r\nIndustrial Training Department or an equivalent qualification recognized by the\r\nHaryana Education Department.\r\n(iii) Knowledge of Hindi upto Matric Standard.\u201D (emphasis added)\r\n5. The case of the petitioners is that they passed their matriculation with the subject\r\nof Arts and Crafts\/Drawing or they have passed the subject of Arts and\r\nCrafts\/Drawing in their matriculation as additional subject. All the petitioners passed\r\ntheir two-year diploma in Art and Craft from the Kurukshetra University.\r\nThe petitioners, on the basis of their qualifications, applied for the aforesaid post to the\r\nCommission. Their applications were not entertained by the Commission for the reason that they\r\nhad passed their two-year diploma in Art and Craft from Kurukshetra University which is not\r\nrecognized as equivalent qualification by the Haryana Education Department, which led to the filing\r\nof the writ petitions in the High Court.\r\n6. On 12.12.2006, the Director of School Education Haryana, Chandigarh, addressed a letter to all\r\nthe District Education Officers\/District Elementary Education Officers in which it was informed that\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft conducted by the Director, Industrial Training and Vocational Education,\r\nHaryana, is the only recognized course in the State of Haryana. This letter further stated that the\r\ndiploma\/certificates in Art and Craft from the Kurukshetra University are not recognized for the\r\npurpose of appointment for Arts and Crafts Teacher in the State of Haryana. The petitioners have\r\nalso challenged the validity of this letter in the writ petitions before the High Court.\r\n7. Respondents no.1 to 3 filed objections opposing the writ petition. It was contended that the\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft is given by the Industrial Training and Vocational Education Department,\r\nHaryana, to the students who attend regular class room teaching. Most of the subjects are practical\r\nsubjects and their studies cannot be possible through distance education. The diploma granted by\r\nthe Kurukshetra University in Art and Craft through distance education is not a teacher training\r\ncourse. Therefore, it cannot be equated with the diploma given through regular class room studies.\r\nMoreover, the said diploma is only for the purpose of self-employment and the same is not\r\nrecognized for the purpose of teacher training course by the Education Department as well as by the\r\nDepartment of Industrial Training and Vocational Education, Haryana.\r\n8. The private respondents in the writ petitions have also taken similar contentions and sought for\r\ndismissal of the writ petitions. The High Court, on consideration of the contentions of the learned\r\ncounsel for the parties and on perusal of the materials placed on record, allowed the writ petitions.\r\nThe High Court held that the petitioners have a legal right to be considered for the post of Arts and\r\nCrafts teachers with the strength of the diploma secured by them from the Kurukshetra University.\r\n9. Learned counsel for the appellants herein (private respondents in the writ petitions) submitted\r\nthat the diploma in Art and Craft granted by the Kurukshetra University is not equivalent to the\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft given by the Industrial Training and Vocational Education Department,\r\nHaryana. It is not recognised by the Haryana Education Department. The diploma in Art and Craft\r\nby the Industrial Training and Vocational Education Department, Haryana, is given to the students\r\nwho attend regular class room teaching. Most of the subjects are practical subjects and their studies\r\ncannot be possible through distance education. The diploma in Art and Craft granted by the said\r\nUniversity is only for enhancing academic qualification. In this connection, learned counsel has\r\ndrawn our attention to Annexures R-1 to R-3 enclosed along with the counter affidavit filed by the\r\nsecond respondent. It is argued that the question is not whether diploma in Art and Craft by the\r\nKurukshetra University through distance education is invalid or illegal. Rather, the question is\r\nwhether the said diploma by the Kurukshetra University is an \u2018equivalent qualification\u2019 to the\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department. It\r\nwas also contended that \u2018equivalence\u2019 is a technical matter and this Court cannot direct the\r\nauthorities to recognize it as equivalent when the expert\u2019s view is otherwise.\r\n10. Learned counsel for the respondent-State of Haryana has supported the submissions advanced\r\nby the learned counsel for the appellants\/private respondents in the writ petition.\r\n11. On the other hand, learned counsel for the writ petitioners-respondents herein would submit\r\nthat the Kurukshetra University was incorporated under the provisions of the Kurukshetra\r\nUniversity Act, 1986 and that all the qualifications awarded through distance education by this\r\nUniversity stand automatically recognized for the purpose of employment to the posts and services\r\nunder the Central Government. The Government of Haryana has repeatedly confirmed the two-year\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft course offered by the Kurukshetra University. In this connection, they have\r\nrelied on the communications issued by the State Government and its Instrumentalities dated\r\n02.11.1999, 27.05.2005 and 30.05.2005. He prays for dismissal of the appeal.\r\n12. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsels of the parties made at the\r\nBar and perused the materials placed on record.\r\n13. As noticed above, the advertisement dated 20.07.2006 was issued by the Commission inviting\r\napplications for filling up of 816 posts of Arts and Crafts teachers in the State of Haryana. One of the\r\nimportant eligibility criteria was a two-year diploma in Art and Craft Examination conducted by the\r\nHaryana Industrial Training Department or an equivalent qualification recognized by the Haryana\r\nEducation Department. The writ petitioners are holders of two-year diploma in Art and Craft from\r\nthe Kurukshetra University. Therefore, the question for consideration is whether the diploma in Art\r\nand Craft by Kurukshetra University through distance education is recognized by the Haryana\r\nEducation Department as an equivalent qualification to the diploma in Art and Craft Examination\r\nconducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department.\r\n14. The materials on record clearly suggest that the Art and Craft Course is a highly practical\r\noriented course and the appointee teachers have to train the students in Art and Craft which is a\r\npractical subject. The diploma in Art and Craft is given by the Industrial Training and Vocational\r\nEducation Department, Haryana, to the students who attend regular class room teaching. Most of\r\nthe subjects are practical subjects and their study is not possible through distance education. The\r\nKurukshetra University grants the diploma in Art and Craft through distance education. This\r\ndiploma cannot be equated with the diploma given through regular class room studies. In fact, in a\r\nmeeting convened by the Financial Commissioner and Principal Secretary, Industrial Training and\r\nVocational Education Department on 27.11.2003, it was decided to ask the Kurukshetra University\r\nto discontinue the said course from the next academic sessions i.e. 2004-2005 as it was running\r\nthrough distance education and the same was not in the best interest of the students. The\r\nKurukshetra University has issued a caution notice in various leading newspapers in which it was\r\nmade clear that some institutions who had given misleading advertisement for Kurukshetra\r\nUniversity course of Art and Craft as a teacher training course. It was also clarified that the diploma\r\nin Art and Craft from the Kurukshetra University does not guarantee any specific job. The Minutes\r\nof the Meeting held on 27.11.2003 under the Chairmanship of Financial Commissioner and\r\nPrincipal Secretary to the Government of Haryana makes this position very clear which is as under:\r\n\u201CMinutes of the meeting held on 27.11.2003 at 11 AM under the chairmanship of\r\nFinancial Commissioner and Principal Secretary to Govt. Haryana, Industrial\r\nTraining & Vocational Education Department regarding Art & Craft course started by\r\nKurukshetra University, Kurukshetra from the session 2003-2004.\r\nPresent\r\n1. Sh. Dhanpat Singh, IAS Higher Education Commissioner, Haryana.\r\n2. Sh. Rajbir Singh, IAS Director, Industrial Training & Vocational Education,\r\nHaryana.\r\n3. Sh. L.C. Gupta Director, Correspondence courses, Kurukshetra University,\r\nKurukshetra _________\r\n1. Director Industrial Training informed that Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra\r\nhas started a 2 Year Art & Craft Course through distance education from this year\r\n2003-2004. The University did not take the permission from either the Education\r\nDepartment or Industrial Training & Vocational Education Department.\r\n2. Mr. L.C. Gupta pointed out that the University can start correspondence courses at\r\ntheir own level and there was no need to seek the permission from Govt. of\r\nHaryana\/Education Department.\r\nHe further told that the public was informed that the course being conducted by them would not\r\nguarantee a job.\r\n3. A two year Art & Craft Teachers Training Course is already being run by the Department of\r\nIndustrial Training & Vocational Education, Haryana. By starting a course of a similar nature,\r\nKurukshetra University, Kurukshetra has stepped into the domain of the Industrial Training &\r\nVocational Education Department. It has further created a confusion in the mind of general public\r\nas both the above courses are similar and it may cause unrest in the youth who has taken admission\r\nin this course as it is not recognized.\r\n4. The Art & Craft Teachers Training Course being conducted by IT & VE Department is a\r\nrecognized Vocational Course whereas the course of Art & Craft started by Kurukshetra University,\r\nKurukshetra is a course conducted through distance education and hence both these courses cannot\r\nbe equated.\r\nIt was decided that Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra may be requested through the Education\r\nDepartment, Haryana to discontinue this course from the next Academic Session 2004-2005.\u201D\r\n15. The caution notice by the Kurukshetra University is as under:\r\n\u201CDIRECTORATE OF CORRESPONDENCE COURSES KURUKSHETRA\r\nUNIVERSITY, KURUKSHETRA CAUTION NOTICE Some\r\nInstitutions\/Organisations have given advertisements in various newspapers\/media\r\nand have invited Computer\/Management\/other Centres to get affiliation\/franchises\r\nof Kurukshetra University for running different courses of the Directorate of\r\nCorrespondence Courses. It is clarified that all these advertisements are illegal and in\r\nviolation of Clause-4 of the terms and conditions of the Agreement for Service\r\nProviders which clearly states that \u201Cin no case the Second Party (Service Provider)\r\nshall be allowed to authorize any other agency\/centre, other than the study centres\r\nrun by it, to enroll students to any course of this University and any violation will lead\r\nto cancellation of this arrangement without any notice and no refund of any fee and\r\nsecurity will be allowed\u201D. Therefore, the persons entering into any such illegal\r\narrangements will be doing so at their own risk and responsibility.\r\nSome institutions\/parties have also given misleading advertisements for the\r\nKurukshetra University Course of Diploma in Art & Craft as a teachers training\r\ncourse. It is also clarified that all DCC courses including Diploma in Art & Craft are\r\nKurukshetra University approved courses and do not guarantee any specific job.\r\nHence, the University will in no way be responsible for any such misleading\r\nadvertisements.

The Director and Under Secretary to the Government of Haryana in his letter dated 24.11.2003\r\nto the Higher Education Commissioner, had clearly stated that the diploma course in Art and Craft\r\nby the Kurukshetra University has not been given recognition by the Education Department. This\r\nletter is as under:\r\n\u201CFrom The Director, Industrial Training & Vocational Education Department,\r\nHaryana To\r\n1. Sh.

This Diploma Course has not been given recognition by\r\nEducation Department and Industrial Training & Vocational Education Department, Haryana.\r\n2. The Finance Commissioner and Secretary to Government of Haryana Industrial Training &\r\nVocational Education Department has called a meeting on 27.11.2003 at 11 A.M. in Room No.335,\r\nIIIrd Floor, New Secretariate Sector-17, Chandigarh to consider the matter of recognition course\r\nbeing run through correspondence course by Kurukshetra University.

It is also relevant to state here that Kurukshetra University itself has clarified that the diploma in\r\nArt and Craft started by it through correspondence is not meant for appointment to the post of Arts\r\nand Crafts Teachers. In fact, Kurukshetra University has never claimed that the aforementioned\r\ndiploma is valid for appointment of Arts and Crafts Teachers. The Registrar of Kurukshetra\r\nUniversity in a public notice dated 27.09.2004 has clarified that this degree is meant for enabling\r\nthe students to become self-employed. None of the documents produced by the petitioners would\r\nindicate that the diploma in Art and Craft awarded by the Kurukshetra University is equivalent to\r\nthe two- year diploma in Art and Craft Examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training\r\nDepartment. In its letter dated 24.12.2004, at Exhibit P-4, the Kurukshetra University has clearly\r\nstated that the University does not guarantee any specific job for any of the courses including the\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft.\r\n19. The documents, Exhibit P-2 to P-4, do not claim that the course in question has been recognized\r\nas equivalent to two-year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana\r\nIndustrial Training Department or an equivalent qualification recognized by the Haryana Education\r\nDepartment.\r\n20. We have already noticed that one of the eligibility criteria for appointment to the post of Arts\r\nand Crafts teacher as per the advertisement dated 20.07.2006 is a \u201Ctwo-year Diploma in Art and\r\nCraft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or an equivalent\r\nqualification recognized by the Haryana Education Department.\u201D It was made clear by the Industrial\r\nTraining and Vocational Educational Department, Haryana, that diploma in Art and Craft Course by\r\nthe Kurukshetra University is conducted through distance education and that this course cannot be\r\nequated with two-year diploma in Art and Craft Course awarded by the Haryana Industrial Training\r\nDepartment. Recognition of the said Course by the State of Haryana, as held by the High Court, is\r\nentirely different from its equivalence. When the experts in the Education Department have held the\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft by the Kurukshetra University is not equivalent to the two-year diploma in\r\nArt and Craft awarded by the Haryana Industrial Training Department, we are of the view that the\r\nHigh Court was not justified in equalizing them.\r\n21. In Mohammad Shujat Ali & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors 1, it was held that the question\r\nregarding equivalence of educational qualifications is a technical question based on proper\r\nassessment and evaluation of the relevant academic standards and practical attainments of such\r\nqualifications. It was further held that where the decision of the Government is based on the\r\nrecommendation of an expert body, then the Court, uninformed of relevant data and unaided by\r\ntechnical insights necessary for the purpose of determining equivalence, would not lightly disturb\r\nthe decision of the Government unless it 1 (1975) 3 SCC 76 is based on extraneous or irrelevant\r\nconsiderations or actuated mala fides or is irrational and perverse or manifestly wrong.\r\n22. In J. Ranga Swamy v. Government of Andhra Pradesh and Others, 2 this Court held that it is not\r\nfor the court to consider the relevance of qualification prescribed for various posts.\r\n23. In State of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Lata Arun, 3 this Court held that the prescribed eligibility\r\nqualification for admission to a course or for recruitment to or promotion in service are matters to\r\nbe considered by the appropriate authority. It was held thus:\r\n\u201C13. From the ratio of the decisions noted above, it is clear that the prescribed\r\neligibility qualification for admission to a course or for recruitment to or promotion\r\nin service are matters to be considered by the appropriate authority. It is not for\r\ncourts to decide whether a particular educational qualification should or should not\r\nbe accepted as equivalent to the qualification prescribed by the authority.\u201D\r\n24. In Guru Nanak Dev University v. Sanjay Kumar Katwal & Anr., 4 this Court has reiterated that\r\nequivalence is a technical academic matter. It cannot be implied or assumed. Any decision of the\r\nacademic body of the university relating to equivalence should be by a specific order or resolution,\r\nduly published. Dealing specifically with whether a distance education course was equivalent to the\r\ndegree of MA (English) of the appellant university therein, the 2 (1990) 1 SCC 288 3 (2002) 6 SCC\r\n252 4 (2009) 1 SCC 610 Court held that no material had been produced before it to show that the\r\ndistance education course had been recognized as such.\r\n25. In Zahoor Ahmad Rather & Ors. v. Sheikh Imtiyaz Ahmad & Ors. 5, it was held that the State, as\r\nan employer, is entitled to prescribe qualifications as a condition of eligibility, after taking into\r\nconsideration the nature of the job, the aptitude required for efficient discharge of duties,\r\nfunctionality of various qualifications, course content leading up to the acquisition of various\r\nqualifications, etc. Judicial review can neither expand the ambit of the prescribed qualifications nor\r\ndecide the equivalence of the prescribed qualifications with any other given qualification.\r\nEquivalence of qualification is a matter for the State, as recruiting authority, to determine.\r\n26. Having regard to the above, in our view, the High Court has erred in holding that the\r\ndiploma\/degree in Art and Craft given by the Kurukshetra University is equivalent to two-year\r\nDiploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or\r\ndiploma in Art and Craft conducted by Director, Industrial Training and Vocational Education,\r\nHaryana.\r\n27. Resultantly, the appeal succeeds and it is accordingly allowed. Consequently, the Judgment and\r\nOrder of the High Court in C.W.P. No.20630 of 2006 and connected matters, impugned herein, are\r\nset aside and the writ 5 (2019) 2 SCC 404 petitions are dismissed. Pending applications, if any, shall\r\nstand disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.\r\n\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J. (S.

The respondent filed\r\nits written statement on 23 (2020) 5 SCC 757 [\u201CNew India Assurance Company Limited\u201D] \u201C13 (2)\r\nThe District Forum shall, if the complaint 54[admitted] by it under Section 12 relates to goods in\r\nrespect of which the procedure specified in sub-section (1) cannot be followed, or if the complaint\r\nrelates to any services,\u2014\r\n(a) refer a copy of such complaint to the opposite party directing him to give his version of the case\r\nwithin a period of thirty days or such extended period not exceeding fifteen days as may be granted\r\nby the District Forum;\r\n(b) where the opposite party, on receipt of a copy of the complaint, referred to him under clause (a)\r\ndenies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or omits or fails to take any action to\r\nrepresent his case within the time given by the District Forum, the District Forum shall proceed to\r\nsettle the consumer dispute,\u2014\r\n(i) on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the complainant and the opposite party, where\r\nthe opposite party denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or\r\n(ii) ex parte on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the complainant where the opposite\r\nparty omits or fails to take any action to represent his case within the time given by the Forum;\r\n(c) where the complainant fails to appear on the date of hearing before the District Forum, the\r\nDistrict Forum may either dismiss the complaint for default or decide it on merits.\u201D September 2019\r\ntogether with IA No 15390 of 2019 for condonation of a delay of 100 days. The appellant filed IA No\r\n15391 of 2019 for the dismissal of the complaint. 5 On 26 September 2019, the NCDRC permitted\r\nthe appellants to file their reply to the respondent\u2019s application for condoning the delay. The\r\nappellants contested the respondent\u2019s application for condonation of delay. The NCDRC, by its\r\norder dated 25 February 2020, condoned the delay subject to the respondent paying costs of Rs\r\n50,000.\r\n6 Mr Salil Paul, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, has submitted that given the\r\njudgment of the Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Limited (supra), a delay in\r\nexcess of the period which is stipulated in Section 13(1)(a) read with Section 13(2)(a) of the\r\nConsumer Protection Act 1986, i.e. thirty days extendable by fifteen days, could not have been\r\ncondoned. The provisions of Section 13 are made applicable to proceedings before the NCDRC by\r\nSection 22.\r\n7 On the other hand, it has been urged on behalf of the respondent that (i) the decision in New India\r\nAssurance Company Limited (supra) has been given prospective effect; (ii) before the decision in\r\nNew India Assurance Company Limited (supra) and during the pendency of the reference to the\r\nConstitution Bench, a two-judge bench of this Court in Reliance General Insurance Company\r\nLimited v. Mampee Timbers and Hardwares Private Limited4 held the field in pursuance (2021) 3\r\nSCC 673 [\u201CReliance General Insurance Company Limited\u201D] of which the consumer fora were\r\npermitted to accept written statements filed beyond the stipulated time of 45 days in an appropriate\r\ncase on suitable terms; and (iii) in the present case, the NCDRC has exercised its discretion while\r\ncondoning the delay, prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench; (iv) hence, the order would not\r\nmerit interference in appeal. More so because the NCDRC noted that the delay was occasioned due\r\nto the respondent filing a criminal case alleging fraud and forgery against the second surveyor.\r\n8 The judgment of the Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Limited (supra) has\r\nheld that the outer limit of time for filing a written statement in Section 13 of the Consumer\r\nProtection Act 1986 is binding. The conclusion in the decision of the Constitution Bench is extracted\r\nbelow:\r\n\u201C62. To conclude, we hold that our answer to the first question is that the District\r\nForum has no power to extend the time for filing the response to the complaint\r\nbeyond the period of 15 days in addition to 30 days as is envisaged under Section 13\r\nof the Consumer Protection Act; and the answer to the second question is that the\r\ncommencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the Consumer\r\nProtection Act would be from the date of receipt of the notice accompanied with the\r\ncomplaint by the opposite party, and not mere receipt of the notice of the complaint.\r\n63. This judgment to operate prospectively. The referred questions are answered\r\naccordingly.\u201D Significantly, in paragraph 63, it has been clarified by the Constitution\r\nBench that the judgment would operate prospectively.\r\n9 Prior to the judgment of the Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Limited\r\n(supra), there was a judgment of a three-judge Bench of this Court in Dr J J Merchant v. Shrinath\r\nChaturvedi 5 which held that to ensure a speedy trial, the legislative mandate of not granting more\r\nthan forty-five days to submit the written statement requires adherence, failing which the purpose of\r\nthe statute would not be fulfilled. Several conflicting decisions of this Court 6 led to a reference to\r\nthe Constitution Bench. Eventually, as noted above, the Constitution Bench in New India Assurance\r\nCompany Limited (supra) held that the District Forum has no power to condone a delay beyond a\r\ndiscretionary period of fifteen days, in addition to thirty days as envisaged in Section 13 of the\r\nConsumer Protection Act 1986. However, given the conflicting decisions which previously held the\r\nfield, the judgment has been made prospective.\r\n10 The issue in the present appeal pertains to a situation where prior to the decision of the\r\nConstitution Bench, the NCDRC had condoned a delay for a period beyond the prescribed statutory\r\nouter limit. In the present case, the NCDRC had exercised its discretion on 25 February 2020 to\r\ncondone the delay prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench on 4 March 2020. In Reliance\r\nGeneral Insurance Company Limited (supra), a two-Judge Bench of this Court had, on 10 February\r\n2017, issued directions to the consumer fora as regards applications for (2002) 6 SCC 635 [\u201CDr. J J\r\nMerchant\u201D] Topline Shoes Ltd. v. Corporation Bank, (2002) 6 SCC 33; Kailash v. Nanhku, (2005) 4\r\nSCC 480; Salem Advocate Bar Assn. (2) v. Union of India, (2005) 6 SCC 344; J.J. Merchant v.\r\nShrinath Chaturvedi, (2002) 6 SCC 635; New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold\r\nStorage (P) Ltd., (2015) 16 SCC 20. condonation during the pendency of the reference to the\r\nConstitution Bench. The Court observed thus:\r\n\u201C5. We consider it appropriate to direct that pending decision of the larger Bench, it\r\nwill be open to the Fora concerned to accept the written statement filed beyond the\r\nstipulated time of 45 days in an appropriate case, on suitable terms, including the\r\npayment of costs, and to proceed with the matter.\u201D Similarly, during the pendency of\r\nthe reference to the Constitution Bench, on 11 February 2016, a two-judge Bench of\r\nthis Court in Bhasin Infotech and Infrastructure Private Limited v. Grand Venezia\r\nBuyers Association 7 had permitted parties to file written statements beyond the\r\nprescribed limitation period, subject to payment of appropriate costs:\r\n\u201C4. Stay of the proceedings before the National Commission would in our opinion not\r\nonly result in procrastination but also cause prejudice to the complainant. The proper\r\ncourse in our opinion is to permit the appellant Company to file its response, which\r\nwas delayed by just about one day. We accordingly permit the appellant to file its\r\nreply before the National Commission within two weeks from today subject to\r\npayment of Rs 50,000 as costs to be paid to the opposite party. The Commission can\r\nupon deposit of costs proceed with the trial of the complainant on merits after\r\nreceiving the reply filed by the respondent. The pendency of present proceedings\r\nshall not be an impediment for the Commission to do so. This however is subject to\r\nthe condition that the respondent complainant is ready and willing to take the\r\nproceedings forward on the conditions aforementioned. In case the respondent\r\ncomplainants have any objection to the continuance of the proceedings before the\r\nCommission they shall be free to seek stay of such proceedings pending 7 (2018) 17\r\nSCC 255 [\u201CBhasin Infotech-2018\u201D] disposal of these appeals in which event the\r\nproceedings shall remain stayed till disposal of the present appeals.\u201D\r\n11 Subsequently, there was another judgment of a two-judge Bench of this Court in Daddy\u2019s Builders\r\nPrivate Limited v. Manisha Bhargava 8. The decision was rendered on 11 February 2021 after the\r\njudgment of the Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Limited (supra). That was a\r\ncase where the NCDRC in a judgment dated 4 September 2020, had confirmed the order of the\r\nKarnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dated 26 September 2018 rejecting an\r\napplication seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statement. The decision of the\r\ntwo-judge Bench in Reliance General Insurance Company Limited (supra) was cited before the\r\nCourt. Referring to the said decision, this Court observed that in the order dated 10 February 2017\r\npronounced in Reliance General Insurance Company Limited (supra), it was specifically stated that\r\nit would be open to the fora concerned to accept written statements filed beyond the stipulated\r\nperiod of 45 days in an appropriate case on suitable terms including the payment of costs. Referring\r\nto the above order, this Court in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra) observed that ultimately it was left to the\r\nconcerned fora to accept written statements beyond the stipulated period of 45 days in an\r\nappropriate case. The Court held that the NCDRC had found no reason to condone the delay on its\r\nmerits:\r\n\u201C6. Now so far as the reliance placed upon the order passed by this Court dated\r\n10-2-2017 in Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. [Reliance General Insurance Co.\r\nLtd.v. Mampee (2021) 3 SCC 669 [\u201CDaddy\u2019s Builders\u201D] Timbers & Hardwares (P)\r\nLtd., (2021) 3 SCC 673] is concerned, the same has been dealt with in detail by the\r\nNational Commission by the impugned order [Daddy's Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha\r\nBhargava, 2020 SCC OnLine NCDRC 697] while deciding the first appeal. As rightly\r\nobserved by the National Commission, there was no mandate that in all the cases\r\nwhere the written statement was submitted beyond the stipulated period of 45 days,\r\nthe delay must be condoned and the written statement must be taken on record. In\r\norder dated 10-2-2017 [Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mampee Timbers &\r\nHardwares (P) Ltd., (2021) 3 SCC 673] , it is specifically mentioned that it will be\r\nopen to the Fora concerned to accept the written statement filed beyond the\r\nstipulated period of 45 days in an appropriate case, on suitable terms, including the\r\npayment of costs and to proceed with the matter. Therefore, ultimately, it was left to\r\nthe Fora concerned to accept the written statement beyond the stipulated period of\r\n45 days in an appropriate case.\u201D The Court also referred to the decision of the\r\nConstitution Bench in the following terms:\r\n\u201C7. As observed by the National Commission that despite sufficient time granted the\r\nwritten statement was not filed within the prescribed period of limitation. Therefore,\r\nthe National Commission has considered the aspect of condonation of delay on\r\nmerits also. In any case, in view of the earlier decision of this Court in J.J. Merchant\r\n[J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, (2002) 6 SCC 635] and the subsequent\r\nauthoritative decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in New India Assurance\r\nCo. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd. [New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v.\r\nHilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 : (2020) 3 SCC (Civ) 338]\r\n, Consumer Fora have no jurisdiction and\/or power to accept the written statement\r\nbeyond the period of 45 days, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned order\r\n[Daddy's Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, 2020 SCC OnLine NCDRC 697]\r\npassed by the learned National Commission.\u201D\r\n12 A few months after the decision in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra), on 8 July 2021, a two-judge Bench\r\nof this Court in Dr A Suresh Kumar v. Amit Agarwal 9 considered a factual situation where the\r\nNCDRC summarily dismissed an application for condonation of delay filed before the decision of the\r\nConstitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Limited (supra). The Court in Dr A Suresh\r\nKumar (supra) held that since the decision of the Constitution Bench was to operate with\r\nprospective effect, applications for condonation of delay filed before 4 March 2020 ought to be\r\nconsidered on merits:\r\n\u201C2. In our view, since the application for condonation of delay was filed prior to the\r\njudgment of the Constitution Bench, which was delivered on 4-3-2020 [New India\r\nAssurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 :\r\n(2020) 3 SCC (Civ) 338] , the said application for condonation of delay ought to have\r\nbeen considered on merits and should not have been dismissed on the basis of the\r\nConstitution Bench judgment in New India Assurance Co.\r\nLtd. [New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 :\r\n(2020) 3 SCC (Civ) 338] because the said judgment was to operate prospectively and the written\r\nstatement as well as the application for condonation of delay had been filed much prior to the said\r\njudgment. Accordingly, the impugned order [Amit Agrawal v. A. Suresh Kumar, 2020 SCC OnLine\r\nNCDRC 927] of Ncdrc deserves to be, and is, hereby set aside.\u201D The decision in Dr A Suresh Kumar\r\n(supra) did not notice the observation of a prior bench of co-equal strength in Daddy\u2019s Builders\r\n(supra).\r\n13 The divergence between the positions in Dr A Suresh Kumar (supra) and Daddy\u2019s Builders\r\n(supra) in interpreting the prospective effect of the decision of the (2021) 7 SCC 466 [\u201CDr. A Suresh\r\nKumar\u201D] Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Limited (supra) was recently noticed\r\non 6 December 2021 by a two-judge Bench of this Court in Bhasin Infotech and Infrastructure\r\nPrivate Ltd. v. Neema Agarwal and Others 10. The Court was considering a consumer complaint and\r\nan application for condonation of delay which were filed before 4 March 2020 but decided after the\r\ndecision of the Constitution Bench. The Court noted the conflicting positions in the following terms:\r\n\u201C9. Two contrary views have emerged as regards what would be meant by the\r\nphrase\u2026.. \u201CThis judgment to operate prospectively\u201D mandated in the Constitution\r\nBench judgment. In the case of Daddy's Builders Private Limited (supra), the\r\napplication for condonation of delay had been rejected by the State Commission prior\r\nto the Constitution Bench opinion on the aspect of power and jurisdiction of the\r\nconsumer fora to condone delay beyond the stipulated 45 days in filing written\r\nsubmission\/reply. The appeal against that decision was rejected by the NCDRC on\r\n4th September, 2020, following the Constitution Bench decision. On prospective\r\noperation of the Constitution Bench Judgment, opinion of the Coordinate Bench in\r\nthe case of Daddy's Builders Private Limited (supra) was that the prospective\r\noperation of the judgment would apply only in cases where delay stood condoned on\r\na date prior to 4th March, 2020. In expressing this view, the Coordinate Bench noted\r\nthat one of the members of the Bench was also a party to the said Constitution Bench\r\ndecision. The position, as regards composition of the Bench is similar in the case of\r\nDr. A. Suresh Kumar (supra) and in that judgment, a more liberal approach has been\r\nadopted. The prospectivity of the Constitution Bench decision has been held to cover\r\ncases where an application for condonation of delay was filed prior to the judgment of\r\nthe Constitution Bench, but whose outcome was yet to be determined at the time the\r\nConstitution Bench judgment was delivered.\u201D 2021 SCCOnLine SC 1186 [\u201CBhasin\r\nInfotech-2021\u201D] The two-judge Bench in Bhasin Infotech-2021 (supra) followed the\r\nline of precedent in Dr A Suresh Kumar (supra) and noted that the prospective effect\r\nof the Constitution Bench would preserve the benefit of the position laid down in\r\nReliance General Insurance Company (supra) concerning applications for\r\ncondonation that had been pending or decided as of 4 March 2020:\r\n\u201C10. In our view, the prospective operation of the Judgment in the case of New India\r\nAssurance Company Limited (supra) ought to cover both sets of the cases in which\r\ndelay in filing written reply stood condoned after accepting the application for\r\ncondonation of delay in filing written statement\/reply as well as the cases where the\r\ndecision on condonation of delay in filing written replies were pending on 4th March,\r\n2020. Once an application is filed for condonation of delay, there may be cases where\r\nsuch applications are decided upon on dates earlier than applications already filed\r\nbut yet to be determined. We do not have any laid down administrative mechanism to\r\ndecide in what manner applications of this nature would be decided and the\r\nconsumer fora or the Courts apply their own discretion on the basis of various\r\nrelevant factors involved in individual cases, to prioritise their hearing. In our\r\nopinion, it would be artificial distinction to distinguish between applications for\r\ncondonation of delay already decided before 4th March, 2020 and the applications\r\nfor condonation of delay pending on that date. So far as persons with pending\r\napplications for condonation of delay in filing written replies are concerned, their\r\nright to have their applications for condonation of delay in filing written replies to be\r\nconsidered, would stand crystallised on 4th March, 2020. Such right has also been\r\nrecognised in the case of Reliance General Insurance Company Limited (supra). Such\r\nright could be extinguished only by specific legal provisions. In the event the\r\nConstitution Bench judgment had altogether negated the right to have delay in filing\r\nwritten statement condoned beyond the period of 45 days, the right of such\r\napplicants could stand extinguished. But as the judgment of the Constitution Bench is\r\nto operate prospectively, in our understanding of the said judgment, those with\r\npending applications for condonation of delay would retain their right to have their\r\napplications considered. But we refrain from expressing any definitive opinion on\r\nthis point as the two Benches of equal strength have taken differing views on the\r\nmanner in which the prospective application of the Constitution Bench judgment\r\nwould be affected. In our opinion, this issue ought to be decided by a larger Bench.\u201D\r\nHowever, in view of the conflicting position in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra), the twojudge Bench in Bhasin Infotech-2021 (supra) sought the reference of the matter to a\r\nlarger bench.\r\n14 To recapitulate, in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra), this Court refused to interfere in a decision of the\r\nNCDRC which had affirmed the judgment of the SCDRC rejecting the application for condonation.\r\nThe application for condonation had not been entertained on merits. However, there are\r\nobservations in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra), based on the decision of the Constitution Bench, which\r\nstate that a delay beyond the outer limit prescribed by Section 13 could not have been condoned.\r\nWhile this is the position which emerges from the decision of the Constitution Bench, the decision\r\nhas been made prospective. In Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra) the application for condonation had been\r\nfiled before the decision of the Constitution Bench and had been rejected on merits. Strictly\r\nspeaking, the observations in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra) were not necessary for its decision since,\r\neven on merits, no case for condonation had been found by the NCDRC in that case. As noted above,\r\nthis Court in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra) after noticing the decision in Reliance General Insurance\r\nCompany (supra) held that it left the discretion to be exercised by the fora during the pendency of\r\nthe reference to the Constitution Bench and in that case, the NCDRC found no reason to condone\r\nthe delay. The subsequent observation of this Court in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra) which implies that\r\nthe principle laid down by the Constitution Bench will even apply to applications for condonation\r\nfiled prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench were unnecessary (once it had been held that\r\neven on merits there was no case for condonation). Moreover, those observations are with respect\r\nnot consistent with the legal position that the Constitution Bench gave prospective effect to its\r\ndecision. 15 The discretion for condonation of delay under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection\r\nAct 1986 is specifically circumscribed by the statute. Similar statutory provisions exist in the\r\nArbitration and Conciliation Act 2015 and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 though in a\r\ndifferent statutory context \u2013 facilitating the sanctity of the arbitral process in the former and the\r\nlegislative intent of ensuring timely disposal and corporate rehabilitation in the latter. The\r\nConsumer protection Act 1986 and its successor are social welfare legislations designed to protect\r\nthe interests of consumers. The Constitution Bench had thus noted:\r\n\u201C28. It is true that \u201Cjustice hurried is justice buried\u201D. But in the same breath it is also\r\nsaid that \u201Cjustice delayed is justice denied\u201D. The legislature has chosen the latter, and\r\nfor a good reason. It goes with the objective sought to be achieved by the Consumer\r\nProtection Act, which is to provide speedy justice to the consumer. It is not that\r\nsufficient time to file a response to the complaint has been denied to the opposite\r\nparty. It is just that discretion of extension of time beyond 15 days (after the 30 days'\r\nperiod) has been curtailed and consequences for the same have been provided under\r\nSection 13(2)(b)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act. It may be that in some cases the\r\nopposite party could face hardship because of such provision, yet for achieving the\r\nobject of the Act, which is speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes,\r\nhardship which may be caused to a party has to be ignored.\u201D This was owing to the\r\nsocial welfare intention of the consumer protection legislation, which essentially\r\nseeks to protect the rights of consumers who avail of myriad goods and services. The\r\nwelfare of litigating consumers has been the guiding principle for interpreting several\r\nprocedural and substantive questions arising out of the Consumer Protection Act\r\n1986. Recently, a two-judge Bench considered the effect of the Consumer Protection\r\nAct 2019 which amended the pecuniary jurisdiction of consumer fora, on pending\r\nproceedings. In arriving at its decision, the Court noted:\r\n\u201C82. It would be difficult to attribute to Parliament, whose purpose in enacting the\r\nAct of 2019 was to protect and support consumers with an intent that would lead to\r\nfinancial hardship, uncertainty and expense in the conduct of consumer litigation\u2026.\u201D\r\nA similar principle is inherent in the decision of the Constitution Bench in New India\r\nAssurance Company Ltd. (supra). However, given the conflicting decisions\r\nconcerning the nature of such discretion, the Constitution Bench considered it\r\nappropriate to give prospective effect to the decision. It did not make a distinction\r\nbetween applications for condonation which had been decided and those which were\r\npending on the date of the decision. Thus, the decision in Daddy\u2019s Builders (supra)\r\nwould not affect applications that were pending or decided before 4 March 2020.\r\nSuch applications for condonation would be entitled to the benefit of the position in\r\nReliance General Insurance Company Limited (supra) which directed consumer fora\r\nto render a decision on merits. We have expounded on the above principles in order\r\nto adopt a bright-line standard which obviates uncertainty on the legal position\r\nbefore the consumer fora and obviates further litigation.\r\n16 In the present case, before the decision of the Constitution Bench, the delay was condoned by the\r\nNCDRC by furnishing reasons for the exercise of such discretion. Having regard to the prospective\r\neffect of the judgment of the Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Limited (supra)\r\nand the orders of this Court in Reliance General Insurance Company Limited (supra) and Bhasin\r\nInfotech-2018 (supra), which had recognized an element of discretion pending the reference, we are\r\nof the considered view that no case for interference is made in the order of the NCDRC allowing the\r\napplication for condonation of delay on merits.\r\n17 Learned counsel for the appellant states that the payment of costs of Rs 50,000 could not be\r\neffected because of the lockdown, but a demand draft is ready. The amount shall be transmitted into\r\nthe account stipulated by the NCDRC within two weeks.\r\n18 Liberty is granted to the appellants to file their replication within a period of four weeks.\r\n19 The appeal is accordingly disposed of.\r\n20 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.\r\n\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...............................J.

          "judgement":"A.S. Bopanna,J.\r\n1. The appellants in all the above three appeals are assailing the order dated 13.08.2009 passed by\r\nthe National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (\u201CNCDRC\u201D for short) in Original\r\nPetition No.289\/1997. Through the said order, the NCDRC has held the appellants herein guilty of\r\nmedical negligence and has directed payment Reason:\r\nof Rs.17,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees Seventeen Lakhs only) with interest at the rate of 9 % per\r\nannum from the date of filing the complaint till the date of payment. The appellant in\r\nCivil Appeal No.7380\/2009 is the doctor who administered anaesthesia to the\r\npatient. The appellant in C.A. No.6933\/2009 is the hospital wherein the operation\r\nwas performed. The appeal bearing C.A. No.8118\/2009 is filed by the New India\r\nAssurance Company Limited from whom the anaesthetist and the hospital had taken\r\nseparate policy to the extent limited under the policy.\r\n2. The brief factual matrix leading to the above case is as here below. The patient Smt. Jasbeer Kaur,\r\nwife of the first claimant and mother of claimants 2 and 3 before the NCDRC visited the appellant\r\nhospital on 08.10.1996 and was diagnosed with kidney stone in her right kidney. She was advised to\r\nundergo surgery by the treating surgeon Dr. R.K. Majumdar. The patient who was examined as an\r\noutpatient had come back to the hospital only on 03.12.1996. On being examined again at that point,\r\nit was noticed that the right kidney had been severely damaged and the left kidney was also\r\ndiagnosed with a stone. In medical terms, the diagnosis was referred as Hydronephrosis, Grade IV\r\nwith renal stone in the right kidney and Hydronephrosis of Grade II in the left kidney. As advised\r\nearlier, the patient was again advised surgery.\r\n3. Accordingly, the patient admitted herself on 06.12.1996 and she was declared fit for surgery. On\r\n07.12.1996, Dr. H.K. Khurana informed the patient as also her husband that both the kidneys could\r\nnot be operated at the same time due to the severe damage. They were advised that as per the\r\nmedical practice, the less affected kidney that is the left kidney would be operated in the beginning\r\nsince complete removal of the right kidney cannot be ruled out. In such eventuality, the left kidney if\r\nrectified would be able to function. The appellants contend that on 09.12.1996 an informed consent\r\nof high\u2212risk surgery was obtained from the patient as well as her husband. The respondent No.1 and\r\nDr. R.K. Majumdar were involved in performing the surgery of the left kidney, which was a\r\nsuccessful operation. As per the say on behalf of the hospital and the doctors, the condition of the\r\npatient improved by 12.12.1996 due to which the possibility of the second surgery to the right kidney\r\nwas considered. The necessary tests conducted by the anaesthetist, the physician and the surgeon\r\nresulted in clearing the patient for the second surgery.\r\n4. The second surgery was prepared to be conducted on 16.12.1996 and the patient was taken to the\r\noperation theatre around 9:45 a.m. The appellant in C.A. No.7380\/2009, namely Dr. H.K. Khurana\r\nadministered the injections of Pentothal Sodium and Scolin as per the medical practice. Subsequent\r\nthereto, an endotracheal tube of 7.5 mm diameter was inserted in the trachea to give nitrous oxide\r\nand oxygen. The appellants contend that the said standard procedure was also followed during the\r\nfirst surgery but on the present occasion the condition of the patient deteriorated, the blood\r\npressure fell and pulse became feeble. The cardiac respiratory arrest was noticed. The efforts said to\r\nhave been made by the doctors including the physician did not yield result, though the patient had\r\nbeen put on Boyle\u2019s machine and necessary oxygen was supplied using the same. In the evening, the\r\npatient is stated to have been put on an automatic ventilator and was shifted to critical care unit.\r\nDespite the best efforts, the patient expired on 23.12.1996.\r\n5. The appellants contend that an issue arose with regard to the payment of the balance medical\r\nbills. When the same was demanded, since the respondent No.1 i.e the husband of the deceased was\r\na union leader at Whirlpool India, a demonstration was held by the workers at the hospital on\r\n06.02.1997 which resulted in the criminal charges in a criminal complaint being filed against the\r\nappellant hospital and also a magisterial enquiry was conducted. The appellant hospital is stated to\r\nhave filed a suit for recovery of the balance of the medical bills due in C.S. No.332\/1997 on\r\n13.08.1997 which according to them had triggered the criminal complaint and claim for\r\ncompensation was made as a counter blast. The criminal complaint is said to have been filed in FIR\r\nNo.128 on 27.09.1997. The complaint before the NCDRC was filed thereafter alleging medical\r\nnegligence and claiming compensation which is dated 06.12.1997. The NCDRC having entertained\r\nthe same has passed the order impugned herein.\r\n6. The allegation against the appellant doctor and the hospital is that they did not exercise the care\r\nwhich was required in treating the patient. Though, the operation on the left kidney conducted on\r\n09.12.1996 was successful, it is contended that the surgeon who had conducted the operation\r\nnamely, Dr. Majumdar had recorded in the case sheet that the patient has poor tolerance to\r\nanaesthesia. It was the further grievance of the claimants before the NCDRC that the second\r\noperation within the short duration was forced upon the patient which led to the consequences.\r\nDespite the observation of the surgeon relating to the poor tolerance to anaesthesia, appropriate\r\ncare was not taken and the required medical equipments more particularly the ventilator was not\r\nkept available. Further, the consent of the patient had not been obtained for the second operation. It\r\nwas contended that even after the patient suffered a cardiac arrest proper care was not taken in\r\nhaving the presence of the cardiologist or a neurologist. The physician who attended the patient had\r\nalso taken some time to change and attend to the patient. It was therefore contended that the said\r\nnegligence on the part of the doctors as well as the hospital had resulted in the death of the patient.\r\n7. The appellants herein, who were the respondents before NCDRC filed their version denying the\r\ncase put forth on behalf of the claimants. It was contended that the high risk involved in the second\r\noperation was made known to the patient and the cardiac arrest which occurred in the present case\r\nis likely to occur in certain cases for which appropriate care had been taken by the doctors. The\r\nobservation relating to poor tolerance to anaesthesia was explained as not being a major issue\r\ninasmuch as the earlier operation was successful and was not eventful though anaesthesia had been\r\nadministered in the same manner for the first surgery.\r\n8. The claimants as well as the respondents before the NCDRC had filed their respective affidavits\r\nand had also exchanged interrogatories. No medical evidence was tendered on behalf of claimants.\r\nBased on the same, the NCDRC arrived at its conclusion.\r\n9. The learned counsel for the appellants in C.A.No.7380\/2009 and C.A. No.6933\/2009 made\r\ndetailed reference to the history of the patient and the patient\u2019s sheet maintained by the hospital. In\r\nthat regard it is pointed out that on 13.12.1996 the doctor had recorded that the surgical recovery\r\nwhich related to the first operation conducted on 09.12.1996, to be excellent. On 14.12.1996, the\r\nobservation recorded also indicated that the patient is insisting for surgery of the other side. In that\r\nlight, also keeping in view the requirement of the surgery to the right kidney which was damaged, a\r\ndecision was to be taken in that regard. The informed consent was obtained from the husband of the\r\npatient where the risk factor had also been recorded. It is contended that every untoward incident\r\ncannot be considered as medical negligence. The learned counsel for the hospital also has referred to\r\nthe documents and the facilities available in the hospital and the care taken by the doctors.\r\n10. The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 would however dispute the position and contend\r\nthat the entire aspect has been taken note by the NCDRC. It is contended that the observation on\r\n14.12.1996 that the patient is insisting for surgery of the other side is an insertion. The learned\r\ncounsel refers to the circumstances and the sequence of events that unfolded on 16.12.1996 to\r\ncontend that immediately on the anaesthesia being administered, the patient had suffered cardiac\r\narrest and the hospital which did not possess a ventilator was negligent. The Boyle\u2019s apparatus was\r\nnot sufficient and the anaesthetist claiming to have manually operated the same for such long time\r\ncannot be accepted as a correct statement. It is further contended that the hospital did not possess\r\npublic address system or paging service which resulted in the delay in securing the physician to\r\nattend and revive the patient.\r\n11. In the background of the rival contentions, the fact that a second operation was performed on\r\n16.12.1996 and the patient had suffered a cardiac arrest after she was administered anaesthesia\r\nappears to be the undisputed position from the medical records as well as the statement of the\r\nparties. Every death of a patient cannot on the face of it be considered as death due to medical\r\nnegligence unless there is material on record to suggest to that effect. It is necessary that the\r\nhospital and the doctors are required to exercise sufficient care in treating the patient in all\r\ncircumstance. However, in unfortunate cases though death may occur and if it is alleged to be due to\r\nmedical negligence and a claim in that regard is made, it is necessary that sufficient material or\r\nmedical evidence should be available before the adjudicating authority to arrive at a conclusion.\r\nInsofar as the enunciation of the legal position on this aspect, the learned counsel for the appellant\r\nhad relied on the decision of the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court in Jacob Mathew vs. State of Punjab and\r\nAnr. (2005) 6 SCC 1 wherein it has been held that the true test for establishing negligence in\r\ndiagnosis or treatment on the part of a doctor is whether he has been proved to be guilty of such\r\nfailure as no doctor of ordinary skill would be guilty of, if acting with ordinary care. The accident\r\nduring the course of medical or surgical treatment has a wider meaning. Ordinarily an accident\r\nmeans an unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence, something that does not occur in the\r\nusual course of events or that could not be reasonably anticipated. The learned counsel has also\r\nreferred to the decision in Martin F.D\u2019Souza vs. Mohd. Ishfaq (2009) 3 SCC 1 wherein it is stated\r\nthat simply because the patient has not favourably responded to a treatment given by doctor or a\r\nsurgery has failed, the doctor cannot be held straight away liable for medical negligence by applying\r\nthe doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitor. It is further observed therein that sometimes despite best efforts\r\nthe treatment of a doctor fails and the same does not mean that the doctor or the surgeon must be\r\nheld guilty of medical negligence unless there is some strong evidence to suggest that the doctor is\r\nnegligent.\r\n12. The learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, referred to the decision in V. Kishan\r\nRao vs. Nikhil Super Speciality Hospital and Another (2010) 5 SCC 513 to contend that the decision\r\nin the case of Martin F.D\u2019Souza (supra) wherein general directions is given to secure medical report\r\nat preliminary stage is held to be not treated as a binding precedent and those directions must be\r\nconfined to the particular facts of that case. It is held that in a case where negligence is evident, the\r\nprinciples of res ipsa loquitur operates and the complainant does not have to prove anything and in\r\nthe said case it is held that in such event it is for the respondent to prove that he has taken care and\r\ndone his duties, to repel the charge of negligence. Though such conclusion has been reached on the\r\ngeneral direction, we take note that in V. Kishan Rao (supra) the fact situation indicated that RW1\r\nhad admitted in his evidence that the patient was not treated for malaria. In that background, it was\r\ntaken into consideration that the patient had been treated for typhoid though the test in that regard\r\nwas found negative and the test for malaria was positive. The said fact situation therefore indicated\r\nthat the principle of res ipsa loquitur would apply. It would be apposite to note that in the very\r\ndecision this Court has expressed the view that before forming an opinion that expert evidence is\r\nnecessary, the Fora under the Act must come to a conclusion that a case is complicated enough to\r\nrequire the opinion of an expert or the facts of the case are such that it cannot be resolved by\r\nmembers of the Fora without the assistance of the expert opinion. It is held that no mechanical\r\napproach can be followed and each case has to be judged on its own facts.\r\n13. In S.K. Jhunjhunwala vs. Dhanwanti Kaur and Another (2019) 2 SCC 282 referred by the learned\r\ncounsel for the respondent, the negligence alleged was of suffering ailment as a result of improper\r\nperformance of surgery. It was held that there has to be direct nexus with these two factors to sue a\r\ndoctor for negligence. In, Nizam\u2019s Institute of Medical Sciences vs. Prasanth S. Dhananka and\r\nOthers (2009) 6 SCC 1 relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent, broad principles\r\nunder which the medical negligence as a tort have to be evaluated is taken note, as has been laid\r\ndown in the case of Jacob Mathew (supra). The ultimate conclusion reached in the case of Nizam\u2019s\r\nInstitute (supra) relating to the lack of care and caution and the negligence on the part of the\r\nattending doctors was with reference to the medical report which was available on record which\r\nindicated the existence of tumour located at left upper chest and in that circumstance the presence\r\nof neuro surgeon was essential and the said procedure not being adopted, a case of negligence or\r\nindifference on the part of the attending doctors had been proved.\r\n14. Having noted the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties, it is clear that in\r\nevery case where the treatment is not successful or the patient dies during surgery, it cannot be\r\nautomatically assumed that the medical professional was negligent. To indicate negligence there\r\nshould be material available on record or else appropriate medical evidence should be tendered. The\r\nnegligence alleged should be so glaring, in which event the principle of res ipsa loquitur could be\r\nmade applicable and not based on perception. In the instant case, apart from the allegations made\r\nby the claimants before the NCDRC both in the complaint and in the affidavit filed in the\r\nproceedings, there is no other medical evidence tendered by the complainant to indicate negligence\r\non the part of the doctors who, on their own behalf had explained their position relating to the\r\nmedical process in their affidavit to explain there was no negligence. The reference made is to the\r\nanswers given by Dr. Khurana to the interrogatories raised by the complainant. In respect of the first\r\noperation, it was clarified that the patient did not have any side effects\/complications during the\r\nfirst operation which was described as uneventful. On leaving the operation theatre, the patient was\r\nin the custody of surgeon. After the operation he had not been called for any complication related to\r\nanaesthesia. Since he had written the anaesthesia notes in the register during the first operation, he\r\ndid not see reason to see the hospital record after the first operation. With regard to the comment of\r\nthe surgeon after the first operation in the treatment sheet regarding the patient being \u2018poorly\r\ntolerant to anaesthesia\u2019, he has replied that the said observation had no meaning since the first\r\noperation was uneventful and was successful. There was no anaesthesia related complication of any\r\nkind. With regard to the emergency which occurred during the second operation and the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich he had alerted the hospital and requisitioned the help of cardiologist, he has answered that\r\nthe full operation theatre team was already there and the cardiologist was summoned by one of the\r\nmembers of the team and the specific details could not be answered by him since the entire team\r\nwas busy in attempting to save the patient.\r\n15. The NCDRC having noted the reply has arrived at the conclusion that since there was a note that\r\nthe patient had poor tolerance to anaesthesia, he had disregarded the observation without holding\r\nany discussion with any other anaesthesiologist and other specialist. Insofar as the facility of the\r\npaging system the NCDRC had taken note that the magisterial enquiry has come to a conclusion that\r\nthere is no paging system. The conclusion reached by the NCDRC on first aspect appears to be an\r\nassumption without the backing of medical evidence. The anaesthetist Dr. Khurana has claimed to\r\nbe experienced in the field and in the contention put forth before the NCDRC has claimed to have\r\nsuccessfully administered anaesthesia to more than 25,000 patients in elective as well as emergency\r\nsurgical procedures. Even if the same is accepted to be a tall claim, the fact remains that he had\r\nsufficient experience of administering anaesthesia. However, the question was as to whether he was\r\nnegligent. That aspect of the matter as to whether in the background of the medical records, the\r\nmanner in which he had proceeded to administer the anaesthesia amounted to negligence could\r\nhave been determined only if there was medical evidence on record. In the instant case it is not a\r\nsituation that the diagnosis was wrong. The fact of both the kidneys requiring to be operated is the\r\nadmitted position. The two aspects which are the foundation for allegation of negligence is that no\r\ncare was taken despite the observation of the surgeon after the first surgery that the patient is poorly\r\ntolerant to anaesthesia. The second aspect is as to whether the patient\u2019s life was exposed to risk by\r\nadvising and preparing for the second operation without sufficient gap after the first operation. Any\r\nof the shortcoming relating to infrastructure as mentioned in the report of the magisterial enquiry\r\nwill become material only if the medical evidence is to the effect that the said two aspects were not\r\nthe normal situation and that undertaking operation in such situation with reference to the medical\r\ncondition of the patient was a high\u2212risk procedure, the backup that ought to have been ensured and\r\nwhether the medical equipments that were available at that point in time were sufficient. Without\r\nreference to the evidence, mere assumption would not be sufficient is the legal position laid down in\r\nthe decisions referred above. Principle of res ipsa loquitur is invoked only in cases the negligence is\r\nso obvious.\r\n16. The next aspect on which the NCDRC has found fault with the appellants is regarding the\r\nconsent being taken only of her husband for the second surgery. Though the NCDRC has referred to\r\nan earlier decision rendered by the Commission on this aspect, what is necessary to be taken note is\r\nthat in the instant facts the first operation had been performed on 09.12.1996 during which time an\r\ninformed consent was taken from the patient as also from her husband. During the second\r\noperation the patient was in the process of recovery from the first operation and the requirement of\r\nsecond surgery was informed to her. In that circumstance the informed consent was obtained from\r\nthe husband. The noting in the document at Annexure RA\u22123 also indicates that he has noted that he\r\nhas been informed about the high risk of his patient in detail and his consent is given. Though it was\r\ncontended before the NCDRC that there was an interpolation in the patient\u2019s sheet on 14.12.2016,\r\nthe informed consent form indicates that it has been written in hand and signed by the patients\u2019\r\nhusband i.e., the first complainant before NCDRC and consent was given and the patient was also\r\nkept in the loop. The complainant who was throughout with the patient and who had given his\r\nconsent did not make any other contrary noting therein so as to hold the non\u2212taking of the consent\r\nfrom the patient against the appellants herein.\r\n17. On the aspect relating to the noting regarding poor tolerance to anaesthesia though the NCDRC\r\nhas reached the conclusion that he had not taken care of such observation, the very fact that the\r\nNCDRC had noted that Dr. Khurana was the anaesthetist during the first surgery could not have\r\nbeen held against him since in the said circumstance he was aware about the details of the patient to\r\nwhom he had administered anaesthesia for the first surgery. When it is shown that the earlier\r\noperation was uneventful, in the absence of any medical evidence brought on record to the contrary\r\nregarding the failure on the part of Dr. Khurana in taking any steps while administering anaesthesia\r\nfor the second operation, the observation of poor tolerance in the case sheet by itself cannot be\r\nassumed as negligence. It is no doubt unfortunate that the patient had suffered cardiac arrest. The\r\nprocedure which was required to be followed thereafter has been followed as per the evidence put\r\nforth by the appellant and the consequences has been explained by them. To arrive at the conclusion\r\nthat there was negligence, the medical evidence to point out negligence in administering anaesthesia\r\neven in that situation was required to be tendered since the adjudicating authority is not an expert\r\nin the field of medicine to record an independent opinion.\r\n18. The NCDRC has placed much reliance on the enquiry report which cannot be treated as contra\r\nmedical evidence as compared to the evidence tendered by the appellants. The observation\r\ncontained in the judgment of the criminal case decided on 27.11.2006, which has been referred to by\r\nthe NCDRC to form its opinion that the said observation amounts to a situation that there was some\r\nserious medical negligence is not the correct position. The conclusion is not that there was\r\nnegligence but keeping in view the standard of proof that is required in a criminal trial to establish\r\ngross negligence, an alternate statement was made by the Court stating that even if there is some\r\nnegligence the same cannot be considered as gross negligence. Such observation was not a finding\r\nrecorded that there was negligence. So far as the reliance placed on an enquiry that was conducted\r\nby the District Magistrate, the same cannot be considered as medical evidence to hold negligence on\r\nthe part of the doctors or the hospital in the matter of conducting the second surgery and the\r\ncondition of the patient in the particular facts of this case. Though, the civil surgeon was a member\r\nof the two\u2212 member committee which conducted the enquiry and certain adverse observations were\r\nmade therein, the conclusion therein is not after assessing evidence and providing opportunity to\r\ncontrovert the same. Based on the statements that have been recorded and the material perused, an\r\nopinion has been expressed which cannot be the basis to arrive at a conclusion in an independent\r\njudicial proceeding where the parties had the opportunity of tendering evidence. In such proceeding\r\nbefore the NCDRC the appellants have tendered their evidence in the nature of affidavit and if the\r\nsame is insufficient the cause would fail. The observations contained in the order of NCDRC is in the\r\nnature of accepting every allegation made by the claimant regarding the sequence and delay in the\r\ndoctors attending to rectify the situation as the only version and has not been weighed with the\r\nversion put forth by the doctors.\r\n19. On the principle of res ipsa loquitur, the NCDRC has taken note of an earlier case wherein the\r\nconclusion reached was taken note in a circumstance where the anaesthesia had killed the patient on\r\nthe operating table. In the instant facts, the patient had undergone the same process of being\r\nadministered anaesthesia for the first operation and the operation had been performed successfully\r\nand the entire process was said to be uneventful. Though in the second operation, the patient had\r\nsuffered a cardiac arrest, the subsequent processes with the help of the Boyle\u2019s apparatus had been\r\nconducted and the patient had also been moved to the CCU whereafter the subsequent efforts had\r\nfailed. The patient had breathed her last after few days. As already noted, there was no contrary\r\nmedical evidence placed on record to establish that the situation had arisen due to the medical\r\nnegligence on the part of the doctors.\r\n20. The very questions raised by the NCDRC at issue Nos.2 to 7 would indicate that in the present\r\nfact situation the first operation performed by the same team of doctors in the same hospital was\r\nsuccessful and the unfortunate incident occurred when the second operation was scheduled. Hence\r\nwhat was required to be determined was whether medically, the second operation could have been\r\nconducted or not in that situation and whether the medical condition of the patient in the present\r\ncase permitted the same. The issues raised by framing the other questions would have arisen\r\ndepending only on the analysis of the medical evidence on those issues at 2 to 7 more particularly\r\nissues 2 and 3.\r\n21. In addition to what has been noted above, in the context of the issues which had been raised for\r\nconsideration, the verbatim conclusion reached by the NCDRC would be relevant to be noted. The\r\nissues No. 2 and 3 which were raised for consideration are the crucial issues which entirely was on\r\nthe medical parlance of the case. The said issues were to the effect as to whether the second surgery\r\nshould have been undertaken since it was recorded that the patient has poor tolerance to\r\nanaesthesia and whether the surgery of the second kidney should have been taken within eight days\r\nfrom the first surgery though it was not an emergency. As noted, the appellants being doctors had\r\ntendered their affidavits indicating that as per the medical practice the same was permissible. On\r\nbehalf of the claimants no medical evidence was tendered. Though from the available records the\r\nNCDRC could have formed its opinion with reference to medical evidence if any, the nature of the\r\nconclusion recorded is necessary to be noted.\r\n\u201CWe are surprised to note that the treating doctor after recording that the patient had poor tolerance\r\nto anaesthesia has tried to defend his action by stating that poor tolerance to anaesthesia means\r\nnothing.\u201D \u201CHowever, we cannot be oblivious of the fact that Dr. Khurana was the Anaesthesiologist\r\nduring the first surgery also and he was fully aware of the conditions of the patient. In reply to the\r\ninterrogatories, he has clearly admitted that he has gone through the notings of Dr. Mazumdar\r\nwherein he has said the patient has poor tolerance to anaesthesia. We are stunned to note that he\r\nhas stated in the reply to interrogatories that in medical parlance poor tolerance to anaesthesia\r\nmeans nothing'.\u201D \u201CIt is common knowledge that a person can survive with one kidney, just as a\r\nperson can survive with one lung. There are cases where a patient suffers from failure of both the\r\nkidneys and nephrectomy is performed to replace one of the damaged kidneys by a kidney of a\r\ndonor after proper test and verification. Therefore, there was no hurry to perform the second\r\nsurgery.\u201D The extracted portion would indicate that the opinion as expressed by the NCDRC is not\r\non analysis or based on medical opinion but their perception of the situation to arrive at a\r\nconclusion. Having expressed their personal opinion, they have in that context referred to the\r\nprinciples declared regarding Bolam test and have arrived at the conclusion that the second surgery\r\nshould not have been taken up in such a hurry and in that context that the appellants have failed to\r\nclear the Bolam test and therefore they are negligent in performing of their duties. The conclusion\r\nreached to that effect is purely on applying the legal principles, without having any contra medical\r\nevidence on record despite the NCDRC itself observing that the surgeon was a qualified and\r\nexperienced doctor and also that the anaesthetist had administered anaesthesia to 25,000 patients\r\nand are not ordinary but experienced doctors.\r\n22. On the aspect relating to the observation of poor tolerance to anaesthesia and the period of\r\nperforming the second operation from the time of first operation was conducted it was a highly\r\ntechnical medical issue which was also dependant on the condition of the patient in a particular case\r\nwhich required opinion of an expert in the field. There was no medical evidence based on which\r\nconclusion was reached with regard to the medical negligence. The consequential issues with regard\r\nto the preparation that was required and the same not being in place including of having a\r\ncardiologist in attendance are all issues which was dependant on the aspect noted above on issues\r\nNo.2 and 3. The observations of the NCDRC in their opinion appears to be that the second operation\r\nought not to have been conducted and such conclusion in fact had led to the other issues also being\r\nanswered against the appellants which is not backed by expert opinion.\r\n23. In the above circumstance when there was no medical evidence available before the NCDRC on\r\nthe crucial medical aspect which required such opinion, the mere reliance placed on the magisterial\r\nenquiry would not be sufficient. Though the opinion of the civil surgeon who was a member of the\r\ncommittee is contained in the report, the same cannot be taken as conclusive since such report does\r\nnot have the statutory flavour nor was the civil surgeon who had tendered his opinion available for\r\ncross\u2212examination or seeking answers by way of interrogatories on the medical aspects. Therefore,\r\nif all these aspects are kept in view, the correctness or otherwise of the line of treatment and the\r\ndecision to conduct the operation and the method followed were all required to be considered in the\r\nbackground of the medical evidence in the particular facts of this case. As indicated, the mere legal\r\nprinciples and the general standard of assessment was not sufficient in a matter of the present\r\nnature when the very same patient in the same set up had undergone a successful operation\r\nconducted by the same team of doctors. Hence, the conclusion as reached by the NCDRC is not\r\nsustainable.\r\n24. For the aforesaid reasons, the order dated 13.08.2009 passed in O.P. No.289 of 1997 is set aside.\r\nThe appeals are accordingly allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.\r\n25. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed of.\r\n.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026J. (HEMANT GUPTA) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J. (A.S.

          "judgement":"Indira Banerjee, J.\r\nLeave granted.\r\n2. This appeal has been filed by the Appellant against a final judgment and order dated 12-02-2021\r\npassed by a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dismissing the appeal, being L.P.A. No.52\/2021,\r\nof the Appellant against an order dated 02-02-2021 passed by the Single Bench dismissing the writ\r\npetition being WP(C) No.499 of 2021 filed by the Appellant.\r\n3. The Appellant, a doctor, who joined service of the Government of National Capital Territory\r\n(NCT) of Delhi, on 5th August 2014, is presently posted as Medical Officer of the Emergency and\r\nAccidents Department at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, New Delhi.\r\n4. The Appellant has duly completed five years of regular and continuous service with the\r\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi and is thus eligible to avail Study Leave to pursue the post graduate\r\ncourse, in accordance with the Directives and Guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family\r\nWelfare, Government of India issued vide O.M.A.12034\/0312012-CHS-V dated 2nd November,\r\n2012, the relevant portion whereof, is extracted hereinbelow:\r\n\u201C1.CHS officer who has satisfactory completed period of probation and has rendered\r\nnot less than five years regular service including the period of probation under the\r\nGovernment and is not due to reach the age of superannuation from Government\r\nservice within five years from the date on which he is expected to return to duty after\r\nthe expiry of the leave, is entitled to avail study leave under Rule 50 of CCS (leave)\r\nRule 1072.\u201D\r\n5. On or about 14th October 2020, the Appellant was duly granted permission to apply for and\r\nappear at the INICET-2020, a highly competitive examination for admission to the MD\/MS courses\r\nin some of the premier medical institutions of the country, such as All India Institute of Medical\r\nSciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI),\r\nChandigarh, etc.\r\n6. The results of the INICET-2020 were declared on 28th November, 2020. The Appellant\r\nsuccessfully cleared the Examination and was, accordingly called by PGI Chandigarh for counselling\r\nfor admission to the MD\/MS course, by a notice dated 24 th December, 2020. The Appellant duly\r\nparticipated in the off-line counselling for the MD\/MS course at PGI, Chandigarh on 29 th\r\nDecember, 2020, and was allotted a seat in the MD course in Paediatrics.\r\n7. The authorities of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital duly issued the required \u2018No Objection\r\nCertificate\u2019 to the Appellant to enable the Appellant to pursue the post graduate course in\r\nPaediatrics at PGI, Chandigarh. After completing all the requisite formalities, the Appellant applied\r\nto the Respondent No.1 for Study Leave as per the Rules, to enable him to join the MD course in\r\nPaediatrics at the PGI, Chandigarh. In the meanwhile, on or about 20th October 2020, a policy\r\ndecision was taken, not to grant any further Study Leave to the doctors working in the hospitals of\r\nthe Government of NCT of Delhi, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n8. Another Office Order dated 22-10-2020 was issued by the Government of NCT of Delhi, Health\r\nand Family Welfare Department (Medical Branch), which is extracted herein below for convenience:\r\n-\r\n\u201CIn view of the prevailing situation of COVID-19 in NCT of Delhi and the projections\r\nmade by Experts about the expected increase in cases of COVID-19 during the period\r\nNovember-December, 2020, it is not feasible, in public interest to spare the services\r\nof GDMOs, to pursue Post Graduation courses. GDMOs cannot be acceded to at this\r\njuncture.\u201D\r\n9. By an order dated 22nd January 2021, the Respondent No.1 rejected the application of the\r\nAppellant for Study Leave, having regard to the policy decision taken by the Government on 20th\r\nOctober, 2020 and the subsequent order dated 22nd October, 2020. On 31st January, 2020,\r\nadmission to the post graduate courses in PGI, Chandigarh, for the 2020 session was closed, and the\r\nallotment of the Post Graduate seat to the Appellant was cancelled.\r\n10. The Appellant had filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the action of the\r\nRespondent No. 1 in not granting Study Leave to the Appellant to enable him to join the post\r\ngraduate course at PGI, Chandigarh. The said writ petition was dismissed by a Single Bench of the\r\nHigh Court, and an appeal therefrom, filed by the Appellant, has been dismissed by the Division\r\nBench of the High Court, by the judgment and order impugned in this appeal.\r\n11. As observed above, even though the Appellant cleared INICET- 2020 and was selected for the\r\npost graduate course in PGI, a premier medical institution, he was declined Study Leave by the\r\nRespondent No.1 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequential policy decision adopted\r\non 20th October 2020, not to grant Study Leave to doctors working in Government hospitals in\r\nDelhi.\r\n12. Ms. Geeta Luthra appearing on behalf of the Appellant argued that the Appellant had arbitrarily\r\nbeen declined Study Leave whereas many other doctors, similarly circumstanced as the Appellant,\r\nhad been granted Study Leave to pursue post graduate courses, even after the onset of the COVID-19\r\npandemic. The Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have thereby discriminated against the petitioner.\r\n13. Ms. Luthra cited the instances of Dr. Dharmendra Kumar, Dr. Vipul Pandey, Dr. Brijesh Patel,\r\nDr. Avneesh Tripathi, Dr. Punit Mishra who had admittedly been granted Study Leave in\r\nJuly\/August\/September, when there were a large number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi.\r\n14. Ms. Luthra argued that on 14th October 2020, when the Appellant was granted permission to\r\napply for and appear at the INICET-2020, the number of new COVID-19 cases reported in the\r\npreceding 24 hours was 3324. However, in December\/January \/February, the daily figure of new\r\ncases had declined substantially. There could, therefore, be no justification in refusing Study Leave\r\nto the Appellant and depriving him of the opportunity to pursue post graduate studies in a premier\r\ninstitution.\r\n15. While it is true that admittedly numerous doctors named in the SLP have been granted Study\r\nLeave during the COVID-19 pandemic, when COVID-19 cases were on the rise, those doctors were\r\ngranted Study Leave before the policy decision of 20th October, 2020 and the order dated 22nd\r\nOctober, 2020 referred to above. Our attention has not been drawn to a single case of grant of Study\r\nLeave to a doctor of a hospital under the Government of NCT, after the said policy decision.\r\n16. Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the\r\nRespondent No.1 argued that the Respondent No.1 had neither acted arbitrarily, nor discriminated\r\nagainst the Appellant, in turning down the request of the Appellant for Study Leave. The order of the\r\nRespondent No.1 in refusing Study Leave to the Appellant had to be taken in view of the Pandemic,\r\nwith predictions of exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 CASES and the consequential policy\r\ndecision taken on 20th October, 2020.\r\n17. Ms. Bhati argued that even though there may have been a decline in the number of fresh\r\nCOVID-19 cases in December\/January\/February, the policy adopted on 20th October, 2020 and the\r\nsubsequent order dated 22nd October, 2020 had not been annulled, in view of predictions of the\r\nlikelihood of a possible second wave and spurt in COVID-19 cases. The doctors of hospitals run by\r\nthe Government of NCT, Delhi, could not, therefore, be spared for higher studies.\r\n18. Ms. Bhati also argued that Study Leave could not be claimed as a matter of right and it was open\r\nto the Government to refuse any application for Study Leave, if the service of the concerned doctor\r\nwas required in public interest. She submitted that the Respondent No.1 has acted within the\r\nparameters of law and has not committed any wrong in not allowing Study Leave to the Appellant.\r\n19. It may be true, as argued by Ms. Bhati, that no leave can be claimed as a matter of right. The\r\nconcerned Respondents have apparently acted within the parameters of law in declining Study\r\nLeave to the Appellant in the teeth of COVID-19 pandemic, when doctors were urgently required in\r\nGovernment hospitals, to treat COVID-19 patients. The fact that some doctors may have been\r\ngranted Study Leave after the spread of COVID-19 cases in Delhi, did not debar the Government\r\nfrom taking a policy decision not to grant Study Leave to doctors any further, when exigencies\r\nnecessitated such a decision.\r\n20. The policy decision is stated to have been prompted by predictions of rise in the number of\r\nCOVID-19 cases in Delhi. The exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in Delhi in April\/May, 2021 with\r\nabout 25,000 new cases per day and the consequential pressure on hospitals, nursing homes, clinics\r\nand other medical establishments justify the apprehension which led to the policy decision of 20 th\r\nOctober, 2020. In any case the prudence of and\/or justification for the policy decision cannot be\r\nexamined by the Court in exercise of its extraordinary power of judicial review under Article 226 of\r\nthe Constitution of India.\r\n21. The policy decision not to grant Study Leave to doctors for a certain length of time, in\r\napprehension of a rise in COVID-19 cases, to ensure the availability of as many doctors, as possible\r\nfor duty, is neither arbitrary, nor discriminatory, nor violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of\r\nIndia.\r\n22. At the same time, this Court cannot be oblivious to the legitimate expectation of COVID-19\r\nwarriors like the Appellant to fair treatment, in conformity with the Service Rules by which they are\r\ngoverned, to enable them to pursue higher education and enhance their educational qualifications.\r\nNeedless to mention that doctors with higher qualifications and special knowledge in specific areas\r\nwould be an asset to the medical fraternity, as also to the society.\r\n23. The guidelines and directions of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as contained in the\r\nOrder being O.M.A. 12034\/0312012-CHS-V dated 2nd November, 2012 entitles a Central Health\r\nService Officer who has satisfactorily completed probation and rendered not less than five years of\r\nregular service, to avail Study Leave under the CCS (Leave) Rules 1972, provided he is not due to\r\nattain the age of retirement within 5 years from the date on which the officer is expected to return to\r\nduty, and\/or in other words, within five years from the date on which his Study Leave ends.\r\n24. The policy decision taken on 20th October, 2020, not to grant further Study Leave to doctors\r\nworking in hospitals under the Government of NCT of Delhi in apprehension of rise in COVID cases,\r\nis obviously a temporary one. The policy cannot continue indefinitely irrespective of changes in\r\ncircumstances. The policy has necessarily to be reviewed from time to time and relaxed and\/or\r\nmodified once there is decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases in the NCT of Delhi.\r\n25. Thankfully, the COVID-19 situation in Delhi is now under control. As on 14th July, 2021, that is,\r\nyesterday, there were total number of 688 active COVID-19 cases, of whom about 250 were in home\r\nisolation, as per news reports based on bulletins issued by the Health Department of the\r\nGovernment. The number of new cases per day has dropped to less than 100. It is reported that in\r\nmost hospitals COVID-19 beds are now lying vacant. The application of the Appellant for Study\r\nLeave should, therefore, be reconsidered.\r\n26. At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the Appellant could not join the Post Graduate\r\nCourse for no fault of his own, as his services were required in public interest, for the cause of\r\nhumanity, to save lives. The admission to the Post Graduate Course was closed on 31st January,\r\n2021 and classes commenced soon thereafter. The Appellant continued to render service to the\r\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi, treating patients at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital. Now that the\r\nCOVID-19 situation in Delhi is under control, the Government of NCT of Delhi should, as a model\r\nemployer, make an endeavour to see that the Appellant is not deprived of the fruits of his success in\r\nthe INICET 2020 and is able to pursue post graduate studies.\r\n27. Mr. Sudarshan Rajan, appearing for PGI Chandigarh, submitted on instructions that candidates\r\nwho had cleared the INICET 2020 and selected to a post graduate course in PGI joined the January,\r\n2021 session. The students who joined the January 2021 session, which commenced in January,\r\n2021, have completed one semester and are now in the second semester. The admission to the next\r\nsession, which is due to commence in July, 2021 will be made by conducting the INICET 2021.\r\n28. Mr. Rajan submits that INICET 2021, which was originally scheduled to be held on 16th June,\r\n2021, has been postponed to 22nd July, 2021 on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. One unfilled\r\nseat of the MD course in Paediatrics, of the sponsored category, for the January 2021 session, at PGI\r\nChandigarh, which had not been filled up because of the inability of the Appellant to join, has been\r\nre- advertised for the July 2021 session and is to be filled up through INICET 2021.\r\n29. Ms. Luthra\u2019s submission that the Appellant be admitted in the January 2021 session cannot be\r\naccepted, since the classes commenced over six months ago and the students who were admitted to\r\nthat session, have completed their first semester and entered the second semester. There can be no\r\nquestion of any direction of this Court, to admit the Appellant to the second semester directly, as\r\nsuggested by Ms. Luthra, when he has not been able to attend a single class of the first semester. The\r\nquestion is, whether the Appellant can be accommodated in the next academic session scheduled to\r\ncommence in July, 2021. Since one unfilled seat in the Post Graduate Course in Paediatrics at the\r\nPGI Chandigarh, has been carried over and re-advertised for the July, 2021 course, no prejudice will\r\nbe caused to any one, if that vacant seat is re-allotted to the appellant once again. Unless the seat is\r\nre-allotted to the Appellant, and the Appellant is granted Study Leave by the Respondent Nos. 1 and\r\n2, he will be irreparably prejudiced.\r\n30. The question of whether a meritorious candidate, denied admission to a medical course, can be\r\naccommodated in that course in the following academic year, was considered by a three Judge\r\nBench of this Court in S. Krishna Sradha vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Others1. The Court\r\nheld: -\r\n\u201C29. However, the question is with respect to a student, a meritorious candidate for\r\nno fault of his\/her has been denied admission illegally and who has pursued his\/her\r\nlegal rights expeditiously and without delay is entitled to any relief of admission more\r\nparticularly in the courses like MBBS \u2026.\r\n30. The aforesaid question is required to be considered only to the cases where (i) no\r\nfault in attributable to the candidate;(ii) the candidate has pursued her rights and\r\nlegal remedies expeditiously and without delay; (iii) where there is fault on the part of\r\nthe authorities and apparent breach of rules and regulations; and (iv) candidate is\r\nfound to be more meritorious then the last candidate who has been given admission.\u201D\r\n31. In S. Krishna Sradha (supra) this Court directed as follows :-\r\n\u201C33. In light of the discussion\/observations made hereinabove, a meritorious\r\ncandidate\/student who has been denied an admission in MBBS Course illegally or\r\nirrationally by the authorities for no fault of his\/her and who has approached the\r\nCourt in time and so as to see that such a meritorious candidate may not have to\r\nsuffer for no fault of his\/her, we answer the reference as under: (i) That in a case\r\nwhere candidate\/student has approached the court at the earliest and without any 25\r\ndelay and that the question is with respect to the admission in medical course all the\r\nefforts shall be made by the concerned court to dispose of the proceedings by giving\r\npriority and at the earliest. (ii) Under exceptional circumstances, if the court finds\r\nthat there is no fault attributable to the candidate and the candidate has pursued\r\nhis\/her legal right expeditiously without any delay and there is fault only on the part\r\nof the authorities and\/or there is apparent breach of rules and regulations as well as\r\nrelated principles in the process of grant of admission which would violate the right\r\nof equality and equal treatment to the competing candidates and if the time schedule\r\nprescribed\u201330th September, is over, to do the complete justice, the Court under\r\nexceptional circumstances and in rarest of rare cases direct the admission in the same\r\nyear by directing to increase the seats, however, it should not be more than one or\r\ntwo seats and such admissions can be ordered within reasonable time, i.e., within one\r\nmonth from 30th September, i.e., cut off date and 26 under no circumstances, the\r\nCourt shall order any Admission in the same year beyond 30th October. However, it\r\nis observed that such relief can be granted only 1 (2019) SCC Online SC 1609 in\r\nexceptional circumstances and in the rarest of rare cases.\r\nIn case of such an eventuality, the Court may also pass an order cancelling the admission given to a\r\ncandidate who is at the bottom of the merit list of the category who, if the admission would have\r\nbeen given to a more meritorious candidate who has been denied admission illegally, would not\r\nhave got the admission, if the Court deems it fit and proper, however, after giving an opportunity of\r\nhearing to a student whose admission is sought to be cancelled. (iii) In case the Court is of the\r\nopinion that no relief of admission can be granted to such a candidate in the very academic year and\r\nwherever it finds that the action of the authorities has been arbitrary and in breach of the rules and\r\nregulations or the prospectus affecting the rights of the students and that a candidate is found to be\r\nmeritorious and such 27 candidate\/student has approached the court at the earliest and without any\r\ndelay,the court can mould the relief and direct the admission to be granted to such a candidate in\r\nthe next academic year by issuing appropriate directions by directing to increase in the number of\r\nseats as may be considered appropriate in the case and in case of such an eventuality and if it is\r\nfound that the management was at fault and wrongly denied the admission to the meritorious\r\ncandidate, in that case, the Court may direct to reduce the number of seats in the management quota\r\nof that year, meaning thereby the student\/students who was\/were denied admission illegally to be\r\naccommodated in the next academic year out of the seats allotted in the management quota. (iv)\r\nGrant of the compensation could be an additional remedy but not a substitute for restitutional\r\nremedies. Therefore, in an appropriate case the Court may award the compensation to such a\r\nmeritorious candidate who for no fault of his\/her has 28 to lose one full academic year and who\r\ncould not be granted any relief of admission in the same academic year.\r\n(v) It is clarified that the aforesaid directions pertain for Admission in MBBS Course only and we\r\nhave not dealt with Post Graduate Medical Course.\u201D\r\n32. The judgment in S. Krishna Sradha (supra) was rendered in the context of admission to the\r\nMBBS Course and not to a post graduate course. However, in National Medical Commission vs.\r\nMothukuru Sriyah Koumudi and Others2, this Court held:-\r\n\u201C11. As the dispute in S. Krishna Sradha (supra) pertained to admission to the\r\nundergraduate MBBS Course, this Court held that they have not dealt with the Post\r\nGraduate Medical Courses. Mr. Parameshwar argued that there is no 2 (2020) SCC\r\nOnline SC 992 reason why the logic behind the judgment in S. Krishna Sradha\r\n(supra) should not be made applicable to Post Graduate Courses. We find force in the\r\nsaid argument of Mr. Parameshwar. This Court was only dealing with the admission\r\nto the MBBS Course for which reason directions given in the said judgment were\r\nrestricted to the MBBS Course. Directions issued in S. Krishna Sradha (supra) can be\r\nmade applicable to admission to Post Graduate Courses as well.\u201D\r\n33. The proposition of law which emerges from the judgments of this Court in S. Krishna Sradha\r\n(supra) and in National Medical Commission v. Mothukuru Sriyah Koumudi and Others (supra) is\r\nthat in rare and exceptional cases, a meritorious candidate, who has suffered injustice by reason of\r\nhis\/her inability to secure admission in a medical course, whether under-graduate or post- graduate,\r\ndue to no fault of his\/her own, who has taken recourse to law promptly, without delay, might be\r\ngranted relief of being accommodated in the same post in the next session.\r\n34. Of course, the judgments in S. Krishna Sradha (supra) and in National Medical Commission vs.\r\nMothukuru Sriyah Koumudi and Others (supra) are clearly distinguishable, in that the concerned\r\npetitioners had wrongfully and illegally been denied admission by disqualifying them. The Appellant\r\non the other hand, cleared INICET- 2020 and was allotted a seat in the post-graduate course in\r\nPaediatrics. PGI, Chandigarh had also acceded to the request of the Appellant to extend the last date\r\nof admission. Unfortunately the Appellant was refused Study Leave.\r\n35. It is well settled that a judgment is an authority for the issue of law which is raised and decided.\r\nWhat is binding on the courts is what the Supreme Court decides under Article 141 and not what the\r\nSupreme Court does under Article 142, in exercise of its power to do complete justice in any cause or\r\nmatter pending before it.\r\n36. To quote V. Sudhish Pai from Constitutional Supremacy A Revisit:\r\n\u201CJudgments and observations in judgments are not to be read as Euclid\u2019s theorems or\r\nas provisions of statute. Judicial utterances\/pronouncements are in the setting of the\r\nfacts of a particular case. To interpret words and provisions of a statute it may\r\nbecome necessary for judges to embark upon lengthy discussions, but such\r\ndiscussion is meant to explain not define. Judges interpret statutes, their words are\r\nnot to be interpreted as statutes. \u201C\r\n37. All the conditions set forth in paragraph 30 of the judgment in S. Krishna Sradha (supra) quoted\r\nabove, would not therefore, be verbatim applicable in the distinguishable facts and circumstances of\r\nthis case, for grant of the rare and extra-ordinary relief of admission to the same course in the next\r\nacademic year. The broad principles laid down by this Court for admission to the same course in the\r\nfollowing session, would have to be followed, to the extent feasible, to advance the cause of justice,\r\nbut not with pedantic rigidity.\r\n38. In this case, the Appellant has not been able to take admission to the MD Course in Paediatrics,\r\nwhich commenced in January, 2021, in circumstances entirely beyond his control, in spite of being\r\nselected for admission after successfully clearing the highly competitive INICET 2020.\r\nUnfortunately, the Appellant was not granted Study Leave from the concerned Respondents, for\r\nreasons not attributable to him. The Appellant was not at fault. But then PGI, Chandigarh was also\r\nnot at fault. The Appellant also approached the High Court promptly, well before the admission was\r\nclosed.\r\n39. Having regard to the circumstances in which the Appellant has been declined Study Leave, it\r\ncannot also be said that the Respon- dent Nos. 1 and 2 have acted beyond the parameters of law.\r\nNever- theless, the Appellant has suffered injustice, because of the denial of Study Leave, in that he\r\nhas been deprived of the opportunity to pur- sue higher studies, which many other doctors have\r\navailed. It would be unfair to deny the Appellant the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of his efforts\r\neven now, when the COVID-19 situation has improved and is in control, only because the\r\nRespondents have not committed \u201Cap- parent breach of rules and regulations\u201D in refusing the\r\nAppellant Study Leave. This Court cannot fold its arms and remain a mute spectator to the plight of\r\nthe Appellant. After all, \u201Cnothing rankles the heart more than a brooding sense of injustice\u201D.\r\n40. In S. Krishna Sradha (supra), the condition of \u201Cfault on the part of the authorities and apparent\r\nbreach of rules and regulations\u201D for grant of the relief of admission to the next session to a candidate\r\nwrongly denied admission in an earlier session, is a sequel to and flows from the condition that\r\nthere should be no fault on the part of that candidate. The Court has elaborated on the condition of\r\n\u201Cno fault of the candidate\u201D to ensure that relief is not claimed as a matter of right for any lapse or\r\ninfraction of rules on the part of the candidate by recourse to the plea of the candidate not being at\r\nfault. To cite an example, an individual candidate cannot as a matter of right claim re- lief when for\r\ninability to fulfil a condition of admission for reasons such as computer crash at his end, inability to\r\nraise funds within time for payment of admission fees, inability to adhere to time schedules by\r\nreason of vehicular breakdown, illness, bereavement etc. which may not be within the control of the\r\ncandidate, as otherwise it would be impossible for educational institutions to complete the\r\nadmission process, in time, when there are a large number of applicants.\r\n41. In this case, there has not been any lapse on the part of the Ap- pellant. The Appellant could not\r\njoint the post graduate course in PGI Chandigarh for the January 2021 session for reasons\r\nattributable to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 though technically, the said Respon- dents cannot be\r\nsaid to have acted illegally or in breach of rules and regulations, in denying the Appellant Study\r\nLeave, in apprehension of rise in COVID-19 cases and the exigency of availability of doctors in full\r\nstrength, as far as possible.\r\n42. The Appellant, who could not join the post graduate course, due to the denial of Study Leave by\r\nthe Government pursuant to a legiti- mate policy decision and in response to the call of duty, cannot\r\nnow be denied relief on the hyper technical ground that the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had not\r\nbreached any rules or regulations. It would be a travesty of justice to deny relief to the Appellant,\r\nwhen the Appellant had to make a personal sacrifice in the larger public interest, to serve the cause\r\nof humanity.\r\n43. Since the seat in the Post Graduate Course in PGI Chandigarh which remained unfilled due to\r\nthe inability of the Appellant to join has been carried over to the July 2021 session which is yet to\r\ncommence, and re-advertised, this Court deems it appropriate to direct the PGI, Chandigarh, being\r\nthe Respondent No. 3 to admit the Appellant to the post graduate course scheduled to commence in\r\nJuly 2021, on the basis of INICET 2020, which he has successfully cleared. The Respondent No. 1\r\nshall re-consider the application of the Appellant for Study Leave, taking into consideration the\r\ndecline in COVID-19 cases in NCT of Delhi, and take a reasonable decision in favour of the\r\nAppellant. Unless there is a substantial rise in COVID-19 cases, the leave application of the\r\nAppellant shall not be declined.\r\n44. These directions are being passed in exercise of the power of this Court under Article 142 of the\r\nConstitution of India, in the facts and circumstances of this case, having regard to the fact that the\r\nAppellant had cleared INICET 2020 held in November 2020 and had been offered admission to\r\nPGI, Chandigarh, but could not join as he was not released on Study Leave in view of the serious\r\nCOVID-19 situation prevailing in NCT of Delhi at the material time, and this order will not be\r\ntreated as a precedent.\r\n45. The appeal is, disposed of, accordingly.

          "judgement":"M.M. SUNDRESH, J.\r\n1. The present appeal has been filed against the order of the Division Bench of the High Court\r\nfinding the appellants guilty of willful disobedience of the order passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No.\r\n5491 of 2001 etc. dated 12.09.2008 in respect to the levy made while upholding Section 21 of the\r\nAssam Agricultural Produce Market Act, 1972.\r\n2. Pending the appeal, the first appellant died on 27.02.2017. Taking note of the aforesaid fact, the\r\nproceedings as against him were declared as abated by the order of this court dated 07.10.2021.\r\n3. We have heard the arguments of the counsels at the Bar and perused the documents filed along\r\nwith the written arguments.\r\nFACTS:\r\n4. While leapfrogging unnecessary facts, a brief sketch is furnished hereunder:\r\na) On 03.09.1974, the Assam Agricultural Produce Market Act, 1972 came into the\r\nstatute book. Section 21 of the Act conferred power on the marketing committees or\r\nthe Assam State Agricultural Marketing Board (hereinafter referred to as \u201Cthe\r\nBoard\u201D) to levy cess on the agricultural produce bought or sold in the notified market\r\narea, at the prescribed rate. Explanation-I appended to the said provision brought in\r\na deeming fiction. Rules were enacted in exercise of the power conferred under\r\nSection 49 of the Act.\r\nb) Writ petitions were filed by the respondent no.1-Association among others before\r\nthe High Court on the premise that its members purchased the agricultural produce\r\noutside the State and thus, no cess is leviable. Rules were struck down leading to the\r\nintroduction of the Amendment Act, 2000, amending Section 21 of the Act while\r\ninserting Section 21A. A challenge made by the Board to the decision of the Full\r\nBench dated 04.04.2001 before this Court resulted in the order dated 08.12.2005,\r\ninter alia holding that in view of the subsequent developments, there is no need to go\r\ninto the issues.\r\nc) Section 21A was inserted by the amending Act, 2006 facilitating the Board to levy\r\nand collect cess for the marketing committees in the notified market areas in addition\r\nto their existing power. This amendment was put into challenge in the batch of writ\r\npetitions before the Division Bench of the High Court. While upholding the\r\nconstitutional validity vide judgment dated 12.09.2008, it has been held that the\r\ndeeming fiction would apply only to such of those cases where a trader fails to\r\nestablish that there is direct evidence of sale or purchase having been undertaken\r\noutside the notified market area. It was further held that disputed questions\r\nincluding that of refund cannot be gone into in a writ petition invoking Article 226 of\r\nthe Constitution of India, and such disputes can be dealt with by the committee\r\nconstituted.\r\nd) Alleging that the orders passed by the Division Bench with respect to the direct\r\nevidence produced by the members of the respondent no.1 were not looked into and\r\nscrutinized on purpose while levying cess, a contempt petition was filed in Contempt\r\nCase (Civil) No.401 of 2008. Incidentally, the respondent no. 1 also filed a Special\r\nLeave Petition (Civil) No. 11317 of 2009 challenging the order of the Division Bench\r\ndated 12.09.2008, which was converted into Civil Appeal No. 9655 of 2013, wherein,\r\nleave was granted by this court vide order dated 25.10.2013.\r\ne) In the aforesaid contempt petition, the Division Bench vide the impugned order\r\ndated 23.10.2009 took note of certain documents produced by two members of the\r\nrespondent no.1, such as sale invoices, lorry challans, tax challans, insurance receipts\r\netc. It went into the factual assertions made, notwithstanding the committee\r\nconstituted by it earlier for the aforesaid purpose and accordingly, hauled all the\r\nappellants for committing willful disobedience.\r\nf) Against the aforesaid order punishing the appellants for having committed a\r\ncontumacious act, a Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.10538 of 2010 was filed by the\r\nBoard and on grant of leave the same was registered as Civil Appeal No. 9656 of\r\n2013. This Court has passed the following order on 30.03.2010 while issuing notice\r\nin the aforesaid appeal filed by the Board when the matter was pending as a special\r\nleave petition:\r\n\u201CPermission to file SLP is granted.\r\nIssue notice on the application for condonation of delay as well as on the special leave\r\npetitions.\r\nAssam State Agricultural Marketing Board is permitted to collect tax in accordance\r\nwith the Judgment passed by the Division Bench of High Court dated 12.9.2008,\r\nuninfluenced by the order passed in the contempt proceedings dated 23.10.2009.\r\nPost along with SLP(C) No. 11317 of 2009.\u201D\r\ng) The special leave petitions filed by the respondent no.1 challenging the original\r\norder of the Division Bench was taken up as Civil Appeal Nos. 9655 of 2013,\r\n9657-9665 of 2013 and 9666 of 2013 and accordingly the order dated 29.09.2021 was\r\npassed, which is appositely referred hereunder:\r\n\u201CLearned Counsel for the Appellants state that the impugned Act has been repealed\r\nby an Ordinance issued on 13.07.2020 and subsequently Act has been brought in\r\nplace.\r\nIn view of the aforesaid, the issue sought to be debated in the present appeals have\r\nbecome academic and thus it is not disputed that the appeals really do not survive for\r\nconsideration.\r\nCivil appeals are disposed of accordingly.\r\nPending applications also stand disposed of.\u201D\r\nh) After the order dated 12.09.2008 passed by the Division Bench upholding Section\r\n21 of the Act, there were exchange of communications between the appellants and the\r\nrespondents. While the respondent no.1 alleged violation of the order passed, the\r\nappellants contended that the action was only taken in tune with the mandate of the\r\nBoard under Section 21 of the Act and the remedy, if any, to the members of the\r\nrespondent no.1 would be before the Committee constituted in pursuance of the said\r\ndecision\r\n5. Thus, much water has flown under the bridge after the order under challenge before us. The\r\nprovision underwent further change having been repealed by an ordinance followed by an\r\nappropriate enactment. In light of the aforesaid factual scenario, we shall proceed with the case.\r\nSUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANTS:\r\n6. Learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the second appellant was transferred\r\non 23.07.2008 and the appellant no. 1 was in-charge only till 21.01.2009. The first appellant died on\r\n27.02.2017. There is no willful and deliberate violation of the order involved. The High Court has\r\nerred in going into the facts in appreciating evidence. It exceeded its jurisdiction which it declined to\r\nexercise even while invoking Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It could have relegated the\r\nmembers of the respondent no.1 to go before the committee constituted. There is absolutely no\r\nmaterial to implicate the appellants with the alleged action of their subordinates. The concept of\r\nvicarious liability is alien to a contempt jurisdiction. Unconditional apologies were also rendered\r\nbefore the High Court. The respondent no.1 is the one who simultaneously assailed the order dated\r\n12.09.2008 passed by the Division Bench, before this Court, while approaching the High Court\r\nunder its contempt jurisdiction. Even otherwise, in light of the subsequent developments, the appeal\r\ndeserves to be allowed. On the aforesaid submissions, the appellants placed reliance upon various\r\ndecisions of this Court in the case of:\r\n\u0082 Ashok Paper Kamgar Union vs. Godha and Ors., (2013) 11 SCC 1 \u0082 Kapildeo Prasad\r\nSah and Ors. vs. State of Bihar, (1999) 7 SCC 569 \u0082 Dinesh Kumar Gupta vs. United\r\nIndia Insurance Company Ltd. and Ors., (2010) 12 SCC 770 \u0082 Anil Ratan Sarkar and\r\nOrs. vs. Hirak Ghosh and Ors., (2002) 4 SCC \u0082 India Airports Employees Union vs.\r\nRanjan Chatterjee and Anr., (1999) 2 SCC 537 \u0082 Director of Education, Uttaranchal\r\nvs. Ved Prakash Joshi and Ors., (2005) 6 SCC 98 \u0082 Union of India and Ors. vs.\r\nSubedar Devassy PV, (2006) 1 SCC 613 \u0082 Mrityunjoy Das and Anr. vs. Sayed Hasibur\r\nTahaman and Ors., (2001) 3 SCC 739 \u0082 Bal Kishan Giri vs. State of Uttar Pradesh,\r\n(2014) 7 SCC 280 SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS:\r\n7. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that the press release\r\nfollowed by the failure on the part of officials working under the appellants would\r\nclearly show the intention to circumvent the orders passed by the Court.\r\nMaterials were accordingly produced. It is a case of deliberate attempt to overcome the judgment of\r\nthe Court, notwithstanding the adequate knowledge. As the High Court has considered the relevant\r\nmaterials, there is no need to interfere with the reasoned order passed.\r\nDISCUSSION:\r\n8. We are dealing with a civil contempt. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 explains a\r\ncivil contempt to mean a willful disobedience of a decision of the Court.\r\nTherefore, what is relevant is the \u201Cwillful\u201D disobedience. Knowledge acquires substantial importance\r\nqua a contempt order. Merely because a subordinate official acted in disregard of an order passed by\r\nthe Court, a liability cannot be fastened on a higher official in the absence of knowledge. When two\r\nviews are possible, the element of willfulness vanishes as it involves a mental element. It is a\r\ndeliberate, conscious and intentional act. What is required is a proof beyond reasonable doubt since\r\nthe proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature. Similarly, when a distinct mechanism is provided and\r\nthat too, in the same judgment alleged to have been violated, a party has to exhaust the same before\r\napproaching the court in exercise of its jurisdiction under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. It is well\r\nopen to the said party to contend that the benefit of the order passed has not been actually given,\r\nthrough separate proceedings while seeking appropriate relief but certainly not by way of a\r\ncontempt proceeding. While dealing with a contempt petition, the Court is not expected to conduct a\r\nroving inquiry and go beyond the very judgment which was allegedly violated. The said principle has\r\nto be applied with more vigor when disputed questions of facts are involved and they were raised\r\nearlier but consciously not dealt with by creating a specific forum to decide the original proceedings.\r\n9. We do not wish to reiterate the aforesaid settled principle of law except by quoting the reasoned\r\ndecision of this Court in Hukum Chand Deswal v. Satish Raj Deswal, 2020 SCC Online SC 438\r\nwherein the celebrated judgment in Ram Kishan v. Tarun Bajaj, (2014) 16 SCC 204, has been\r\nquoted. The following paragraphs would govern the aforesaid principle:\r\n\u201C18. At the outset, we must advert to the contours delineated by this court for\r\ninitiating civil contempt action in Ram Kishan vs. Tarun Bajaj & Ors. In paragraphs\r\n11, 12 and 15 of the reported decision, this Court noted thus:\r\n\u201C11. The contempt jurisdiction conferred on to the law courts power to punish an\r\noffender for his wilful disobedience\/contumacious conduct or obstruction to the\r\nmajesty of law, for the reason that respect and authority commanded by the courts of\r\nlaw are the greatest guarantee to an ordinary citizen that his rights shall be protected\r\nand the entire democratic fabric of the society 5 (2014) 16 SCC 204 18 will crumble\r\ndown if the respect of the judiciary is undermined. Undoubtedly, the contempt\r\njurisdiction is a powerful weapon in the hands of the courts of law but that by itself\r\noperates as a string of caution and unless, thus, otherwise satisfied beyond\r\nreasonable doubt, it would neither be fair nor reasonable for the law courts to\r\nexercise jurisdiction under the Act. The proceedings are quasi criminal in nature, and\r\ntherefore, standard of proof required in these proceedings is beyond all reasonable\r\ndoubt. It would rather be hazardous to impose sentence for contempt on the\r\nauthorities in exercise of the contempt jurisdiction on mere probabilities. (Vide V.G.\r\nNigam v. Kedar Nath Gupta, (1992) 4 SCC 697, Chhotu Ram v. Urvashi Gulati, (2001)\r\n7 SCC 530, Anil Ratan Sarkar v. Hirak Ghosh, (2002) 4 SCC 21, Bank of Baroda v.\r\nSadruddin Hasan Daya, (2004) 1 SCC 360, Sahdeo v. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 705\r\nand National Fertilizers Ltd. v. Tuncay Alankus, (2013) 9 SCC 600.\r\n12. Thus, in order to punish a contemnor, it has to be established that disobedience of the order is\r\n\u201Cwilful\u201D. The word \u201Cwilful\u201D introduces a mental element and hence, requires looking into the mind of\r\na person\/contemnor by gauging his actions, which is an indication of one's state of mind. \u201CWilful\u201D\r\nmeans knowingly intentional, conscious, calculated and deliberate with full knowledge of\r\nconsequences flowing therefrom. It excludes casual, accidental, bona fide or unintentional acts or\r\ngenuine inability. Wilful acts does not encompass involuntarily or negligent actions. The act has to\r\nbe done with a \u201Cbad purpose or without justifiable excuse or stubbornly, obstinately or perversely\u201D.\r\nWilful act is to be distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or\r\ninadvertently. It does not include any act done negligently or involuntarily. The deliberate conduct\r\nof a person means that he knows what he is doing and intends to do the same. Therefore, there has\r\nto be a calculated action with evil motive on his part. Even if there is a disobedience of an order, but\r\nsuch disobedience is the result of some compelling circumstances under which it was not possible\r\nfor the contemnor to comply with the order, the contemnor cannot be punished. \u201CCommittal or\r\nsequestration will not be ordered unless contempt involves a degree of default or misconduct.\u201D (Vide\r\nS. Sundaram Pillai v. V.R. Attabiraman, (1985) 1 SCC 591, Rakapalli Raja Ram Gopala Rao v.\r\nNaragani Govinda Sehararao, (1989) 4 SCC 255, Niaz Mohammad v. State of 19 Haryana, (1994) 6\r\nSCC 332, Chordia Automobiles v. S. Moosa, (2000) 3 SCC 282, Ashok Paper Kamgar Union v.\r\nDharam Godha, (2003) 11 SCC 1, State of Orissa v. Mohd. Illiyas, (2006) 1 SCC 275 and Uniworth\r\nTextiles Ltd. v. CCE, (2013) 9 SCC 753.\r\nxxx xxx xxx\r\n15. It is well settled principle of law that if two interpretations are possible, and if the action is not\r\ncontumacious, a contempt proceeding would not be maintainable. The effect and purport of the\r\norder is to be taken into consideration and the same must be read in its entirety. Therefore, the\r\nelement of willingness is an indispensable requirement to bring home the charge within the\r\nmeaning of the Act. [See Sushila Raje Holkar v. Anil Kak, (2008) 14 SCC 392 and Three Cheers\r\nEntertainment (P) Ltd. v. CESC Ltd., (2008) 16 SCC 592.\u201D Similarly, in R.N. Dey & Ors. vs.\r\nBhagyabati Pramanik & Ors., this Court expounded in paragraph 7 as follows:\r\n\u201C7. We may reiterate that the weapon of contempt is not to be used in abundance or\r\nmisused. Normally, it cannot be used for execution of the decree or implementation\r\nof an order for which alternative remedy in law is provided for. Discretion given to\r\nthe court is to be exercised for maintenance of the court's dignity and majesty of law.\r\nFurther, an aggrieved party has no right to insist that the court should exercise such\r\njurisdiction as contempt is between a contemner and the court. It is true that in the\r\npresent case, the High Court has kept the matter pending and has ordered that it\r\nshould be heard along with the first appeal. But, at the same time, it is to be noticed\r\nthat under the coercion of contempt proceeding, appellants cannot be directed to pay\r\nthe compensation amount which they are disputing by asserting that claimants were\r\nnot the owners of the property in question and that decree was obtained by\r\nsuppressing the material fact and by fraud. Even presuming that the claimants are\r\nentitled to recover the amount of compensation as awarded by the trial court as no\r\nstay order is granted by the High Court, at the most they are entitled to recover the\r\nsame by executing the 6 (2000) 4 SCC 400 20 said award wherein the State can or\r\nmay contend that the award is a nullity. In such a situation, as there was no wilful or\r\ndeliberate disobedience of the order, the initiation of contempt proceedings was\r\nwholly unjustified.\u201D xxx xxx xxx\r\n22. Pertinently, the special leave petitions were filed by the respondent against the\r\norder dated 28.1.2019, which as aforesaid, did not deal with the question regarding\r\nthe monthly rent payable by the respondent but explicitly left the parties to pursue\r\nthe same before the executing Court. The plaintiff\/petitioner having acquiesced of\r\nthat observation of the High Court, cannot be allowed to contend to the contrary.\r\nThis Court in Jhareswar Prasad Paul & Anr. vs. Tarak Nath Ganguly & Ors., in\r\nparagraph 11, opined thus:\r\n\u201C11. \u2026 The court exercising contempt jurisdiction is not entitled to enter into\r\nquestions which have not been dealt with and decided in the judgment or order,\r\nviolation of which is alleged by the applicant. The court has to consider the direction\r\nissued in the judgment or order and not to consider the question as to what the\r\njudgment or order should have contained. At the cost of repetition, 7 (2002) 5 SCC\r\n352 23 be it stated here that the court exercising contempt jurisdiction is primarily\r\nconcerned with the question of contumacious conduct of the party, which is alleged to\r\nhave committed deliberate default in complying with the directions in the judgment\r\nor order. If the judgment or order does not contain any specific direction regarding a\r\nmatter or if there is any ambiguity in the directions issued therein then it will be\r\nbetter to direct the parties to approach the court which disposed of the matter for\r\nclarification of the order instead of the court exercising contempt jurisdiction taking\r\nupon itself the power to decide the original proceeding in a manner not dealt with by\r\nthe court passing the judgment or order. If this limitation is borne in mind then\r\ncriticisms which are sometimes levelled against the courts exercising contempt of\r\ncourt jurisdiction \u201Cthat it has exceeded its powers in granting substantive relief and\r\nissuing a direction regarding the same without proper adjudication of the dispute\u201D in\r\nits entirety can be avoided. This will also avoid multiplicity of proceedings because\r\nthe party which is prejudicially affected by the judgment or order passed in the\r\ncontempt proceeding and granting relief and issuing fresh directions is likely to\r\nchallenge that order and that may give rise to another round of litigation arising from\r\na proceeding which is intended to maintain the majesty and image of courts.\u201D xxx xxx\r\nxxx\r\n23. Thus understood, we find force in the explanation offered by the respondent that\r\nas per its bona fide understanding, there was no outstanding dues payable to the\r\npetitioner. Moreover, as observed by the High Court, these aspects could be answered\r\nby the executing Court if the parties pursue their claim(s) before it in that regard.\r\nSuffice it to observe that it is not a case of intentional violation or wilful disobedience\r\nof the order passed by this Court to initiate contempt action against the respondent.\r\nInstead, we hold that it would be open to the parties to pursue their claim(s) in\r\nexecution proceedings or any other proceedings, as may be permissible in law in\r\nrespect of the issue(s) under consideration. In such proceedings, all aspects can be\r\nconsidered by the concerned forum\/Court on merits in accordance with law. We say\r\nno more.\r\n24. Reverting to the allegation about damage caused to the suit property by the\r\nrespondent at the time of vacating the same, in our opinion, the respondent has made\r\nout a formidable case that it did not cause any damage, much less permanent damage\r\nto the structure in the suit property.\r\nWhereas, the petitioner was relying on photographs concerning the debris on the site left behind at\r\nthe time of vacating the suit property. The debris cannot cause damage and it is certainly not a case\r\nof defacement of the suit property. That position is reinforced from the fact that the water park in\r\nthe suit premises was started and became fully functional within 2-3 months. Viewed thus, it is\r\nrightly urged that it can be safely assumed that no damage was caused by the respondent to the\r\nstructure in question. Minor repairs required to be carried out by the petitioner for making the\r\nwater park functional cannot be painted as intentional disobedience of the order of this Court. In\r\nany case, that being a complex question of fact, need not be adjudicated in the contempt\r\nproceedings. We leave it open to the petitioner to pursue even that claim in execution proceedings or\r\nsuch other proceedings as may be permissible in law. We may not be understood to have expressed\r\nany final opinion in respect of condition of the suit premises, whilst handing over possession to the\r\npetitioner. We hold that even this issue under consideration does not warrant initiation of contempt\r\naction against the respondent.\u201D\r\n10. On facts, we find that the High Court on the earlier occasion while dealing with the challenge\r\nmade to Section 21 of the Act, made a categorical assertion that it did not wish to go into the\r\ndisputed questions of fact. However, in the order under challenge it was done. A finding has been\r\ngiven on the documents produced by the respondent no.1 which could at best be pieces of evidence\r\nto be appreciated by the committee constituted already. It is the specific case of the appellants that\r\nthey did not violate the directives of the court. There is no material to either establish their\r\nknowledge on the action of their subordinates, or that they acted in collusion with each other.\r\nVicarious liability as a principle cannot be applied to a case of contempt. The question as to whether\r\nthe drivers of two members of the respondent no.1 showed the order passed by the court and the\r\ndocuments produced are true and genuine being in the realm of adjudication, ought not to have\r\nbeen taken up by the High Court while exercising contempt jurisdiction. We may note that it is the\r\nrespondent no.1 who not being satisfied with the order passed by the High Court, filed the special\r\nleave petition. Even in the communications sent apart from the Press Note, it is nowhere stated that\r\nthe order passed by the court could be violated. We find that the subsequent developments also shall\r\nenure to the benefit of the appellants. In cases where cess was levied, individual members of the\r\nrespondent no.1 could have made their challenge before the committee. In our considered view, the\r\nentire exercise of the High Court is not warranted and the aggrieved members of the respondent\r\nno.1 could have been well advised to seek the alternative remedy open to them including redressal\r\nthrough the committee.\r\n11. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we accordingly set aside the order passed by the High Court\r\non 23.10.2009 in Contempt Case No.401 of 2008. Consequently, the appeal filed by the appellant\r\nnos. 2 to 4 stands allowed. No costs.\r\n\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

          "judgement":"M. R. Shah, J.\r\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 13.08.2021\r\npassed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in O.S.A. No.292 of 2019, by which the Division\r\nBench of the High Court has dismissed the said appeal preferred by the original plaintiff rejecting\r\nthe plaint\/suit filed by the appellant herein \u2013 original plaintiff on the ground that the suit is barred\r\nby Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, the original plaintiff has preferred the present appeal.\r\n2. The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:\u2212 2.1 That original defendant No.3\r\n\u2212 respondent No.3 herein (hereinafter referred to as original defendant No.3) availed the loan\r\nfacility vide Rupee Loan Agreement dated 26.07.2011 from defendant No.2 \u2212 respondent No.2\r\nherein \u2013 SREI Infrastructure Finance Limited and availed the financial assistance to the extent of\r\nRs.500 crores. The appellant herein \u2013 original plaintiff stood as guarantor. A mortgage was created\r\nby the appellant herein \u2013 original plaintiff in favour of defendant No.2 \u2013 respondent No.2 herein \u2013\r\nfinancial creditor over its factory land at Evalur, Tamil Nadu along with plant and machinery, by\r\nway of deposit of title deeds in terms of the declaration to secure the repayment, discharge and\r\nredemption by original defendant No.3. That original defendant No.3 \u2013 corporate debtor could not\r\npay the loan amount, therefore the proceedings under the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC)\r\nwas initiated against the corporate debtor. An application under Section 7 of the IBC was filed by the\r\nState Bank of India against original defendant No.3 \u2013 corporate debtor. The default amount was\r\nINR 923,75,00,000\/\u2212. The resolution process was initiated and an interim resolution professional\r\nwas appointed under the provisions of IBC. A resolution plan came to be approved by the\r\nCommittee of Creditors under Section 30(4) of the IBC.\r\nThe learned Adjudicating Authority vide order dated\r\n17.04.2018 approved the resolution plan. Under the\r\napproved resolution plan an amount of INR\r\n241,71,84,839.18 was required to be paid and 67,23,710 equity shares of the corporate debtor were\r\nto be allotted. As per the case on behalf of the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein on payment of aforesaid\r\namount and transfer of aforesaid shares No Due Certificate was issued in favour of the corporate\r\ndebtor \u2013 original defendant No.3 on 25.06.2018 and the corporate debtor came to be discharged. It\r\nappears that thereafter an assignment agreement was executed between defendant No.2 \u2013\r\nrespondent No.2 herein and defendant No.1 \u2013 respondent No.1 herein on 30.06.2018, assigning all\r\nthe rights, titles and interest in all the financial assistance provided by defendant No.2 \u2013 financial\r\ncreditor \u2212 respondent No.2 herein in terms of agreement dated 26.07.2011 in favour of assignee \u2212\r\nrespondent No.1. As assignee \u2212 respondent No.1 herein pursuant to the assignment agreement dated\r\n30.06.2018 had issued letter to all the interested parties, namely, assignor \u2212 financial creditor,\r\nguarantor and corporate debtor informing that assignor \u2013 financial creditor \u2212 respondent No.2\r\nherein had absolutely assigned all the rights, title and interest in all the financial assistance granted\r\nby financial creditor \u2212 respondent No.2 herein from time to time to corporate debtor in favour of\r\nassignee \u2212 respondent No.1 herein vide assignment agreement dated 30.06.2018. The said letter was\r\nresponded by the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein stating the following :\u2212\r\n(i) \u201CRespondent No.2 had duly filed its claim before the Resolution Professional in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of IBC.\r\n(ii) This claim was crystallised and admitted at INR 577.90 Crores and also formed part of the\r\napproved Resolution Plan of Vedanta Limited.\r\n(iii) Pursuant to the approved Resolution Plan, the entire debt of Respondent No.2 has been\r\ndischarged by way of allotment of shares and payment in cash on 6.06.2018 and 21.06.2018\r\nrespectively.\r\n(iv) It was also highlighted that in terms of section 3.2(xi) of the approved Resolution Plan, upon\r\ndischarge of financial creditors (including Respondent No.2), the financial creditors were required\r\nto redeliver and cause to be delivered to Petitioner all documents encumbered with the financial\r\ncreditors.\r\n(v) Therefore, when no due was outstanding and in fact redelivery of encumbered assets was\r\nrequired, there was no basis under contract or law for assignment of loan\/debts\/securities.\r\n(vi) It was emphasised that assignment agreement dated 30.06.2018 was null, void ab initio and\r\nwithout any basis.\u201D 2.2 That thereafter on the basis of the assignment agreement dated 30.06.2018,\r\nthe assignee \u2013 original defendant No.1 \u2013 respondent No.1 herein initiated the proceedings against\r\nthe plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein, who stood as guarantor, under Section 13(2) of the Securitisation\r\nand Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI\r\nAct) by issuing a notice dated 27.12.2018, demanding the payment of INR 587,10,08,309 due under\r\nthe rupee term loan agreement dated 26.07.2011. Notice dated 27.12.2018 of the SARFAESI Act was\r\nresponded by the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein vide reply dated 20.02.2019 stating that pursuant to\r\nrepayment of amount in terms of the approved resolution plan, all the claims of financial creditor \u2212\r\nrespondent No.2 herein stand extinguished and consequently, no claim can be made by the assignee\r\n\u2212 respondent No.1 herein for the same default and that no amount is due and payable to assignee \u2212\r\nrespondent No.1. That thereafter a possession notice dated 19.06.2019 was issued under rule 8 (1) of\r\nthe Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 by the assignee to the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein.\r\nThus a possession notice was published in the newspaper on 22.06.2019.\r\n2.3 That thereafter the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein instituted a Civil Suit being C.S.(D) No.18962 of\r\n2019 on 22.06.2019 before the High Court of Madras and prayed for the following reliefs:\u2212 \u201C(i). To\r\ndeclare that the 1st Defendant acquired no rights against the Applicant herein under the Assignment\r\nDeed dated 30.06.2018, arid consequently, declare that the 1st Defendant is not a secured creditor\r\nvis\u2212a\u2212vis, the Applicant herein; and\r\n(ii). Consequently, to declare Possession Notice dated 19.6.2019 issued by the 1st Defendant herein\r\nhas null and vend and render justice.\u201D 2.4 The suit was filed with an application seeking leave to file\r\nthe suit with the aforesaid prayers. As observed hereinabove, the suit was filed on 22.06.2019.\r\nImmediately thereafter appellant herein \u2013 plaintiff also filed an application before the Debt\r\nRecovery Tribunal (DRT), Chennai under Section 17(1) of SARFAESI Act on 17.07.2019 against the\r\npossession notice dated 19.06.2019 praying that the assignee has acquired no rights under the\r\nassignment agreement dated 30.06.2018 and consequently, assignee \u2212 respondent No.1 is not a\r\nsecured creditor vis\u2212a\u2212vis the appellant \u2013 plaintiff and also to declare possession notice dated\r\n19.06.2019 as null and void. The registry of DRT returned the application filed under Section 17(1)\r\nof SARFAESI Act by observing as under:\u2212 \u201CCounsel for the Appellant has represented SA without\r\ncomplying with the defects read out, however with an endorsement that he is a proper and necessary\r\nparty and that relief prayed for vide Para VII(i) is maintainable. He has reiterated that relief has to\r\nbe sought in relation to the notice under challenge.\r\nMay be returned.\u201D 2.5 The defendants appeared before the High Court in C.S.(D) No.18962 of 2019,\r\naffidavits and counter affidavits were filed by the parties to the suit. By order dated 30.09.2019, the\r\nlearned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed application No.4322 of 2019 and C.S.(D)\r\nNo.18962 of 2019 on the ground of jurisdiction observing that the suit is for land and property\r\nsituated outside the jurisdiction of the court and therefore the suit is not maintainable. It was also\r\nobserved and held that the civil court\u2019s jurisdiction is barred in view of Section 34 of the SARFAESI\r\nAct and only DRT had competence to decide the matter.\r\n3. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High\r\nCourt dismissing the application as well as the suit vide order dated 30.09.2019, appellant herein \u2013\r\noriginal plaintiff filed an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court being O.S.A. No.292 of\r\n2019. By the impugned judgment and order the Division Bench of the High Court has dismissed the\r\nsaid appeal in view of the bar under Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act.\r\n4. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division\r\nBench of the High Court confirming the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge\r\nrejecting the plaint\/dismissing the suit as not maintainable in view of the bar under Section 34 of\r\nthe SARFAESI Act, original plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein has preferred the present appeal.\r\n5. Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant and Shri\r\nShyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate has appeared with Shri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned Senior\r\nAdvocate, on behalf of the respondents \u2013 defendants. 5.1 Dr. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate\r\nappearing on behalf of the plaintiff \u2212 appellant herein has vehemently submitted that in the facts\r\nand circumstances of the case both, learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench have\r\nmaterially erred in rejecting the plaint and dismissing the suit on the ground that the suit is barred\r\nin view of the bar under Section 34 of SARFAESI Act.\r\n5.2 It is submitted that the High Court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact that in\r\nthe suit plaintiff had pleaded the fraud and it was the case on behalf of the plaintiff \u2013 appellant\r\nherein that the assignment agreement dated 30.06.2018 is fraudulent and relief was sought to\r\ndeclare the assignment agreement dated 30.06.2018 as null and void by the plaintiff \u2013 appellant\r\nherein, the said relief cannot be granted by the DRT under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act and\r\ntherefore the bar under Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act shall not be applicable.\r\n5.3 It is submitted that when the suit is filed alleging \u2018fraud\u2019 the bar under Section 34 of the\r\nSARFAESI Act shall not be applicable and the suit for the reliefs sought in the plaint shall be\r\nmaintainable.\r\n5.4 It is submitted that even otherwise considering the fact that subsequently and before the\r\nassignment agreement, the proceedings under the IBC against the corporate debtor with respect to\r\nthe loan agreement dated 26.07.2011were initiated and the resolution plan was approved and entire\r\namount due and payable under the approved resolution plan was paid to the successful resolution\r\napplicants and even 67,23,710 equity shares of the corporate debtor came to be transferred as per\r\nthe approved resolution plan and the original loanee \u2013 corporate debtor was discharged and NOC\r\nwas issued, therefore, assignment deed can be said to be \u2018fraudulent\u2019 after the resolution plan under\r\nIBC and the amount paid under the resolution plan and on transfer of the shares as per the\r\napproved resolution plan and the corporate debtor was discharged. Therefore, there shall not be any\r\ndues to be paid by the appellant herein as guarantor. 5.5 It is submitted that as such not only the\r\nassignment agreement dated 30.06.2018 is null and void and is \u2018fraudulent\u2019 even the assignee\r\ncannot be said to be a secured creditor so far as the appellant is concerned. 5.6 It is further\r\nsubmitted by Dr. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant that there is\r\nno legally enforceable debt by the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein for the reasons stated above and\r\ntherefore the initiation of the proceedings under the SARFAESI Act are bad in law and not\r\nmaintainable.\r\n5.7 In the alternative, it is prayed by Dr. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the\r\nappellant that in case this Court is not inclined to entertain the present appeal, confirming the\r\njudgment and order passed by the High Court rejecting the plaint\/dismissing the suit, in that case\r\nthe original plaintiff \u2013 appellant may be given an opportunity to file the proceedings before the DRT\r\nunder the SARFAESI Act and all the contentions including that assignment agreement is null and\r\nvoid; that assignee cannot be said to be the secured creditor under the assignment agreement dated\r\n30.06.2018; and that there are no dues so far as the appellant \u2013 plaintiff is concerned may be kept\r\nopen. He has stated that in that case the appellant shall file appropriate proceedings before the DRT\r\nwithin a period of two weeks from today.\r\n6. Present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate and Shri\r\nHuzefa Ahmadi, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the contesting defendants \u2013\r\noriginal defendants \u2013 respondents herein. 6.1 It is vehemently submitted that the suit before the\r\nlearned Single Judge filed by the appellant is rightly held to be not maintainable in view of the bar\r\nunder Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act.\r\n6.2 It is vehemently submitted that as such the suit is rightly held to be not maintainable. It is\r\nsubmitted that initiation of the proceedings by the appellant by filing of the suit for the reliefs\r\nsought in the plaint is nothing but abuse of process of law and court.\r\n6.3 It is submitted that the allegations of \u2018fraud\u2019 are nothing but a clever drafting only with a view to\r\nbring the suit maintainable before the civil court despite the bar under Section 34 of the SARFAESI\r\nAct.\r\n6.4 It is vehemently submitted by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents\r\nherein \u2013 original defendants that except using the word \u2018fraud\u2019\/\u2019fraudulent\u2019, there are no other\r\nparticulars pleaded in support of the allegations of fraud. It is submitted that pleading of \u2018fraud\u2019 is\r\nmade at two places in the plaint namely para 31 and para\r\n46. At both these places, the assertion is that consequent to the alleged discharge of the debt of the\r\ncorporate debtor through the proceedings under the IBC, no assignment of such debt in favour of\r\nassignee could have been made and, thus, for this reason, the initiation of proceedings under the\r\nSARFAESI Act, is fraudulent. It is submitted that on the aforesaid ground the assignment deed\r\ncannot be said to be \u2018fraudulent\u2019.\r\n6.5 It is further submitted that the word \u2018fraud\u2019\/\u2019fraudulent\u2019 are used in the plaint only with a view to\r\nbring the suit maintainable before the civil court and to get out of the bar under Section 34 of the\r\nSARFAESI Act. It is submitted that after a month of filing of the suit, the appellant filed an\r\napplication under Section 17(1) of SARFAESI ACT before the DRT, Chennai, assailing the possession\r\nnotice issued by the assignee under section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act, however, in the said\r\napplication, no allegation of any kind of fraud was made against any of the respondents.\r\n6.6 It is submitted that in any case a bare review of the assertions in paras 31 and 46, it can be seen\r\nthat no material particulars have been pleaded so as to constitute a pleading of \u2018fraud\u2019 as required\r\nunder Order VI Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Code,1908 (CPC). It is submitted that apart from use\r\nof adjectives such as \u2018fraudulent\u2019 etc., qua the assignment deed, no actual material particulars have\r\nbeen given with regard to the \u2018fraud\u2019. It is submitted that the pleadings in para 31 and para 46 do not\r\nsatisfy the test of \u2018fraud\u2019 under Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. 6.7 It is vehemently\r\nsubmitted by the learned Senior Advocates appearing on behalf of the respondents herein that as\r\nper the settled preposition of law pleading without any material particulars would not tantamount to\r\na pleading of \u2018fraud\u2019. Reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in the cases of Bishundeo\r\nNarain & Anr. vs. Seogeni Rai & Jagernath, (1951) SCR 548; Ladli Parshad Jaiswal vs. The Karnal\r\nDistillery Co. Ltd., Karnal &Ors.,(1964) 1 SCR 270; Canara Bank vs. P. Selathal & Ors.,(2020) 13\r\nSCC 143; H.S Goutham vs. Rama Murthy & Anr.,(2021) 5 SCC 241; Ram Singh vs. Gram Panchayat\r\nMehal Kalan & Ors.,(1986) 4 SCC 364; and Union of India & Anr. vs. K.C Sharma & Company &\r\nOrs.,(2020) 15 SCC 209.\r\n6.8 Making the above submissions and relying upon the decisions of this Court in aforesaid cases, it\r\nis prayed to dismiss the present appeal.\r\n7. We have heard the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length.\r\n7.1 It is the case on behalf of the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein that in the plaint there are allegations of\r\nthe \u2018fraud\u2019 with respect to the assignment agreement dated 30.06.2018 and it is the case on behalf of\r\nthe plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein that assignment agreement is \u2018fraudulent\u2019 in as much as after the full\r\npayment as per the approved resolution plan under the IBC and the original corporate debtor is\r\ndischarged, there shall not be any debt by the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein as a guarantor and\r\ntherefore Assignment deed is fraudulent. Therefore, it is the case on behalf of the plaintiff \u2013\r\nappellant herein that the suit in which there are allegations of \u2018fraud\u2019 with respect to the assignment\r\ndeed shall be maintainable and the bar under Section 34 of SARFAESI Act shall not be applicable.\r\n7.2 However, it is required to be noted that except the words used \u2018fraud\u2019\/\u2019fraudulent\u2019 there are no\r\nspecific particulars pleaded with respect to the \u2018fraud\u2019. It appears that by a clever drafting and using\r\nthe words \u2018fraud\u2019\/\u2019fraudulent\u2019 without any specific particulars with respect to the \u2018fraud\u2019, the plaintiff\r\n\u2013 appellant herein intends to get out of the bar under Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act and wants the\r\nsuit to be maintainable. As per the settled preposition of law mere mentioning and using the word\r\n\u2018fraud\u2019\/\u2019fraudulent\u2019 is not sufficient to satisfy the test of \u2018fraud\u2019. As per the settled preposition of law\r\nsuch a pleading\/using the word \u2018fraud\u2019\/ \u2018fraudulent\u2019 without any material particulars would not\r\ntantamount to pleading of \u2018fraud\u2019. In case of Bishundeo Narain and Anr. (Supra) in para 28, it is\r\nobserved and held as under:\u2212 \u201C.... Now if there is one rule which is better established than any other,\r\nit is that in cases of fraud, undue influence and coercion, the parties pleading it must set forth full\r\nparticulars and the case can only be decided on the particulars as laid. There can be no departure\r\nfrom them in evidence. General allegations are insufficient even to amount to an averment of fraud\r\nof which any court ought to take notice however strong the language in which they are couched may\r\nbe, and the same applies to undue influence and coercion\r\nSee Order 6, Rule 4, Civil Procedure Code.\u201D 7.3 Similar view has been expressed in the case of Ladli\r\nParshad Jaiswal (Supra) and after considering the decision of the Privy Council in Bharat Dharma\r\nSyndicate vs. Harish Chandra (64 IA 146), it is held that a litigant who prefers allegation of fraud or\r\nother improper conduct must place on record precise and specific details of these charges. Even as\r\nper Order VI Rule 4 in all cases in which the party pleading relies on any misrepresentation, fraud,\r\nbreach of trust, wilful default, or undue influence, particulars shall be stated in the pleading.\r\nSimilarly in the case of K.C Sharma & Company (Supra) it is held that \u2018fraud\u2019 has to be pleaded with\r\nnecessary particulars. In the case of Ram Singh and Ors. (Supra), it is observed and held by this\r\nCourt that when the suit is barred by any law, the plaintiff cannot be allowed to circumvent that\r\nprovision by means of clever drafting so as to avoid mention of those circumstances by which the\r\nsuit is barred by law of limitation.\r\n7.4 In the case of T. Arivandandam vs. T.V. Satyapal & Anr.\r\n(1977) 4 SCC 467, it is observed and held in para 5 as under:\u2212 \u201C5. We have not the slightest\r\nhesitation in condemning the petitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the court repeatedly\r\nand unrepentently resorted to. From the statement of the facts found in the judgment of the High\r\nCourt, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending before the First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a\r\nflagrant misuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints. The learned Munsif must remember\r\nthat if on a meaningful \u2014 not formal \u2014 reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious, and meritless,\r\nin the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his power under Order 7, Rule\r\n11 CPC taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever drafting has\r\ncreated the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party\r\nsearchingly under Order 10, CPC. An activist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits.\u201D 7.5 A\r\nsimilar view has been expressed by this court in the recent decision in the case of P. Selathal & Ors.\r\n(Supra).\r\n8. Having considered the pleadings and averments in the suit more particularly the use of word\r\n\u2018fraud\u2019 even considering the case on behalf of the plaintiff, we find that the allegations of \u2018fraud\u2019 are\r\nmade without any particulars and only with a view to get out of the bar under Section 34 of the\r\nSARFAESI Act and by such a clever drafting the plaintiff intends to bring the suit maintainable\r\ndespite the bar under Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act, which is not permissible at all and which\r\ncannot be approved. Even otherwise it is required to be noted that it is the case on behalf of the\r\nplaintiff \u2013 appellant herein that in view of the approved resolution plan under IBC and thereafter\r\nthe original corporate debtor being discharged there shall not be any debt so far as the plaintiff \u2013\r\nappellant herein is concerned and therefore the assignment deed can be said to be \u2018fraudulent\u2019. The\r\naforesaid cannot be accepted. By that itself the assignment deed cannot be said to be \u2018fraudulent\u2019. In\r\nany case, whether there shall be legally enforceable debt so far as the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein is\r\nconcerned even after the approved resolution plan against the corporate debtor still there shall be\r\nthe liability of the plaintiff and\/or the assignee can be said to be secured creditor and\/or whether\r\nany amount is due and payable by the plaintiff, are all questions which are required to be dealt with\r\nand considered by the DRT in the proceedings initiated under the SARFAESI Act. It is required to be\r\nnoted that as such in the present case the assignee has already initiated the proceedings under\r\nSection 13 which can be challenged by the plaintiff \u2013 appellant herein by way of application under\r\nSection 17 of the SARFAESI Act before the DRT on whatever the legally available defences which\r\nmay be available to it. We are of the firm opinion that the suit filed by the plaintiff \u2013 appellant\r\nherein was absolutely not maintainable in view of the bar contained under Section 34 of the\r\nSARFAESI Act. Therefore, as such the courts below have not committed any error in rejecting the\r\nplaint\/dismissing the suit in view of the bar under Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act.\r\n9.

Shri Banerjee, learned ASG has heavily relied upon Section 19(5),\r\nSection 20(3) and Section 20(5) of the Act, 1987 in support of his submission that a\r\nLok Adalat shall have jurisdiction to determine and to arrive at a compromise or a\r\nsettlement between the parties to a dispute and has no jurisdiction to enter into the\r\nmerits of the case and decide the matter on merits, in case the settlement is not\r\narrived at. It is submitted, therefore, that the impugned order passed by the Lok\r\nAdalat, Madhya Pradesh High Court is wholly without jurisdiction. Reliance is placed\r\nupon the decision of this Court in the case of State of Punjab and Ors. Vs. Ganpat Raj\r\n(2006) 8 SCC 364.\r\n3.1 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent while opposing the present appeal has\r\nsubmitted that the matter was placed before the Lok Adalat with the consent of the learned counsel\r\nfor the appellant. It is submitted that, therefore, once the matter was placed before the Lok Adalat\r\nwith the consent, entire matter would be at large before the Lok Adalat and, therefore, having found\r\nno substance in the petition, the members of the Lok Adalat have rightly dismissed the writ petition,\r\nwhich in the facts and circumstances of the case is not required to be interfered with by this Court in\r\nexercise of power under Article 136 of the Constitution.\r\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.\r\n5. The short question which is posed for consideration of this Court is whether in the Lok Adalat\r\nheld by the High Court, was it open for the members of the Lok Adalat to enter into the merits of the\r\nwrit petition and to dismiss the same on merits, in absence of any settlement arrived at between the\r\nparties?\r\n6. While answering the aforesaid question, the relevant provisions of the Legal Services Authorities\r\nAct, 1987, which would have been a bearing on the jurisdiction of the Lok Adalat are required to be\r\nreferred to, which read as under:-\r\n\u201C19. Organization of Lok Adalats--(1) Every State Authority or District Authority or\r\nthe Supreme Court Legal Services Committee or every High Court Legal Services\r\nCommittee or, as the case may be, Taluk Legal Services Committee may organise Lok\r\nAdalats at such intervals and places and for exercising such jurisdiction and for such\r\nareas as it thinks fit.\r\n(2) Every Lok Adalat organised for an area shall consist of such number of :-\r\n(a) serving or retired judicial officers; and\r\n(b) other persons, of the area as may be specified by the State Authority or the\r\nDistrict Authority or the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee or the High Court\r\nLegal Services Committee, or as the case may be, the Taluk Legal Services\r\nCommittee, organising such Lok Adalats.\r\n(3) The experience and qualifications of other persons referred to in clause (b) of\r\nsub-section (2) for Lok Adalats organised by the Supreme Court Legal Services\r\nCommittee shall be such as may be prescribed by the Central Government in\r\nconsultation with the Chief Justice of India.\r\n(4) The experience and qualifications of other persons referred to in clause (b) of\r\nsub-section (2) for Lok Adalats other than referred to in sub-section (3) shall be such\r\nas may be prescribed by the State Government in consultation with the Chief Justice\r\nof the High Court.\r\n(5) A Lok Adalat shall have jurisdiction to determine and to arrive at a compromise\r\nor settlement between the parties to a dispute in respect of :-\r\n(i) any case pending before; or\r\n(ii) any matter which is falling within the jurisdiction of, and is not brought before,\r\nany court for which the Lok Adalat is organised.\r\nProvided that the Lok Adalat shall have no jurisdiction in respect of any case or matter relating to an\r\noffence not compoundable under any law.\r\n20. Cognizance of Cases by Lok Adalats--(1) Where in any case referred to in clause (i) of sub-section\r\n(5) of Section 19-(i)\r\n(i) (a) the parties thereof agree; or\r\n(i) (b) one of the parties thereof makes an application to the court, for referring the case to the Lok\r\nAdalat for settlement and if such court is prima facie satisfied that there are chances of such\r\nsettlement; or\r\n(ii) the court is satisfied that the matter is an appropriate one to be taken cognizance of by the Lok\r\nAdalat, the court shall refer the case to the Lok Adalat:\r\nProvided that no case shall be referred to the Lok Adalat under sub-clause (b) of\r\nclause (i) or clause (ii) by such court except after giving a reasonable opportunity of\r\nbeing heard to the parties.\r\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,\r\nthe Authority or Committee organising the Lok Adalat under sub-section (1) of\r\nSection 19 may, on receipt of an application from any, one of the parties to any matter\r\nreferred to in clause\r\n(ii) of sub-section (5) of Section 19 that such matter needs to be determined by a Lok\r\nAdalat, refer such matter to the Lok Adalat, for determination:\r\nProvided that no matter shall be referred to the Lok Adalat except after giving a\r\nreasonable opportunity of being heard to the other party.\r\n(3) Where any case is referred to a Lok Adalat under subsection (1) or where a reference has been made to it under sub-section (2), the Lok Adalat shall\r\nproceed to dispose of the case or matter and arrive at a compromise or settlement between the\r\nparties. (4) Every Lok Adalat shall, while determining any reference before it under this Act, act with\r\nutmost expedition to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties and shall be guided\r\nby the principles of justice equity, fair play and other legal principles.\r\n(5) Where no award is made by the Lok Adalat on the ground that no compromise or settlement\r\ncould be arrived at between the parties, the record of the case shall be returned by it to the court,\r\nfrom which the reference has been received under sub-section (1) for disposal in accordance with\r\nlaw.\r\n(6) Where no award is made by the Lok Adalat on the ground that no compromise or settlement\r\ncould be arrived at between the parties, in a matter referred to in sub- section (2), that Lok Adalat\r\nshall advice the parties to seek remedy in a court.\r\n(7) Where the record of the case is returned under sub- section (5) to the court, such court shall\r\nproceed to deal with such case from the stage which was reached before such reference under\r\nsub-section (1).\u201D 6.1 As per sub-section (5) of Section 19, a Lok Adalat shall have jurisdiction to\r\ndetermine and to arrive at a compromise or a settlement between the parties to a dispute in respect\r\nof (i) any case pending before; or (ii) any matter which is falling within the jurisdiction of, and is not\r\nbrought before, any court for which the Lok Adalat is organised. As per sub-section (1) of Section 20\r\nwhere in any case referred to in clause\r\n(i) of sub-section (5) of Section 19- (i) (a) the parties thereof agree; or (i)\r\n(b) one of the parties thereof makes an application to the court, for referring the case to the Lok\r\nAdalat for settlement and if such court is prima facie satisfied that there are chances of such\r\nsettlement or (ii) the court is satisfied that the matter is an appropriate one to be taken cognizance\r\nof by the Lok Adalat, the court shall refer the case to the Lok Adalat. It further provides that no case\r\nshall be referred to the Lok Adalat under sub-clause (b) of clause (i) or clause (ii) by such court\r\nexcept after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the parties.\r\n6.2 As per sub-section (3) of Section 20 where any case is referred to a Lok Adalat under sub-section\r\n(1) or where a reference is made to it under sub-section (2), the Lok Adalat shall proceed to dispose\r\nof the case or matter and arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties. Sub-section (5)\r\nof Section 20 further provides that where no award is made by the Lok Adalat on the ground that no\r\ncompromise or settlement could be arrived at between the parties, the record of the case shall be\r\nreturned by it to the court, from which the reference has been received under sub-section (1) for\r\ndisposal in accordance with law.\r\n7. Thus, a fair reading of the aforesaid provisions of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 makes it\r\nclear that the jurisdiction of the Lok Adalat would be to determine and to arrive at a compromise or\r\na settlement between the parties to a dispute and once the aforesaid settlement \/ compromise fails\r\nand no compromise or settlement could be arrived at between the parties, the Lok Adalat has to\r\nreturn the case to the Court from which the reference has been received for disposal in accordance\r\nwith law and in any case, the Lok Adalat has no jurisdiction at all to decide the matter on meris once\r\nit is found that compromise or settlement could not be arrived at between the parties.\r\n8. Identical question came to be considered by this Court in the case of State of Punjab and Ors. Vs.\r\nGanpat Raj (supra) and after considering Section 20 of the Act, 1987, it is observed and held in\r\nparagraph 7 as under:-\r\n\u201C7. The specific language used in sub-section (3) of Section 20 makes it clear that the\r\nLok Adalat can dispose of a matter by way of a compromise or settlement between\r\nthe parties. Two crucial terms in sub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 20 are\r\n\u201Ccompromise\u201D and \u201Csettlement\u201D. The former expression means settlement of\r\ndifferences by mutual concessions. It is an agreement reached by adjustment of\r\nconflicting or opposing claims by reciprocal modification of demands. As per Termes\r\nde la Ley, \u201Ccompromise is a mutual promise of two or more parties that are at\r\ncontroversy\u201D. As per Bouvier it is \u201Can agreement between two or more persons, who,\r\nto avoid a law suit, amicably settle their differences, on such terms as they can agree\r\nupon\u201D. The word \u201Ccompromise\u201D implies some element of accommodation on each\r\nside. It is not apt to describe total surrender. (See NFU Development Trust Ltd., Re\r\n[(1973) 1 All ER 135 : (1972) 1 WLR 1548 (Ch D)] ). A compromise is always bilateral\r\nand means mutual adjustment. \u201CSettlement\u201D is termination of legal proceedings by\r\nmutual consent. The case at hand did not involve compromise or settlement and\r\ncould not have been disposed of by the Lok Adalat. If no compromise or settlement is\r\nor could be arrived at, no order can be passed by the Lok Adalat. Therefore, the\r\ndisposal of Civil Writ Petition No. 943 of 2000 filed by the respondent is clearly\r\nimpermissible.\u201D\r\n9. In view of the above, the impugned order passed by the Lok Adalat dismissing the writ petition on\r\nmerits is unsustainable and deserves to be quashed and set aside. The submission made by the\r\nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent that once the matter was placed before the\r\nLok Adalat with consent, thereafter the entire matter is at large before the Lok Adalat and, therefore,\r\nthe Lok Adalat is justified in disposing the matter on merits has no substance and the same is\r\nrequired to be rejected outright. The consent to place the matter before the Lok Adalat was to arrive\r\nat a settlement and or a compromise between the parties and not for placing the matter before the\r\nLok Adalat for deciding the matter on merits. Once there is no compromise and\/or a settlement\r\nbetween the parties before the Lok Adalat, as provided in sub-section (5) of Section 20, the matter\r\nhas to be returned to the Court from where the matter was referred to Lok Adalat for deciding the\r\nmatter on merits by the concerned court.\r\n10. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned order passed by the Lok\r\nAdalat, Madhya Pradesh High Court dated 30.11.2013 in Writ Petition No.8074 of 2011 is hereby\r\nquashed and set aside. The matter is remanded to the High Court to decide the Writ Petition\r\nNo.8074 of 2011 on merits and in accordance with law. The Writ Petition No.8074 of 2011 is ordered\r\nto be restored to the file of the High Court for its decision on merits and in accordance with law. The\r\npresent appeal is accordingly allowed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no\r\norder as to costs.\r\nPending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.\r\n",
          "qa_pairs":"S. ABDUL NAZEER, J.\r\nLeave granted.\r\n2. This appeal is directed against the Order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi dated\r\n19.09.2017 in FAO(OS) (COMM)No.120\/2017 whereby it has upheld the judgment of the learned\r\nSingle Judge in OMP (COMM) No.28 of 2017 dated 10.03.2017, resulting in denial of pendente lite\r\ninterest on the award amount to the appellant.\r\n3. The respondent floated a tender for construction of boundary wall at its 2x750 MW Pragati III\r\nCombined Cycle Power at Bawana, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the project\u2019). The appellant\r\nsubmitted its bid for the project which was accepted by the respondent. Pursuant to which, the\r\nrespondent issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the appellant dated 09.09.2008. Subsequently, on\r\n24.10.2008 the parties entered into a contract which, inter alia, contained the interest barring clause\r\nwhich is reproduced hereunder:\r\n\u201CClause 17: No interest shall be payable by BHEL on Earnest Money Deposit, Security\r\nDeposit or on any moneys due to the contractor.\u201D\r\n4. The disputes arose between the parties with respect to the aforesaid contract and\r\nsubsequently the appellant filed a petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and\r\nConciliation Act, 1996 (for short, \u201Cthe 1996 Act\u201D) before the Delhi High Court wherein\r\nthe Court vide Order dated 16.09.2011 appointed Hon\u2019ble Mr. Justice M.A. Khan\r\n(Retd.) as the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes.\r\nThe appellant in the claim petition, apart from claiming various amounts under different heads,\r\ninter alia claimed pre\u2212reference, pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 24% on the value of\r\nthe award. Learned Arbitrator after hearing the contentions of both the parties concluded that there\r\nis no prohibition in the contract dated 24.10.2008 and LOI dated 09.09.2010 about payment of\r\ninterest for the pre\u2212suit, pendente lite and future period. Therefore, he awarded pendente lite and\r\nfuture interest at the rate of 10% p.a. to the appellant on the award amount from the date of filing of\r\nthe claim petition i.e. 02.12.2011 till the date of realization of the award amount.\r\n5. The respondent challenged the said award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act before the Delhi High\r\nCourt in O.M.P. (COMM.) 28\/2017 on various grounds, inter alia, on the ground that the learned\r\nArbitrator being creature of the arbitration agreement travelled beyond the terms of the contract in\r\nawarding pendente lite interest on the award amount as the same was expressly barred in terms of\r\nthe contract. The learned Single Judge vide his final judgment and order dated 10.03.2017 held as\r\nunder:\r\n\u201CThe Arbitrator fell in error in holding that the aforesaid clause only prescribed pre\u2212\r\nreference interest and not pendente lite interest. As stated earlier, in terms of Section\r\n31(7)(a) of the Act, the power of the arbitral tribunal to award pre award interest is\r\ncontingent to the parties not agreeing to the contrary. Pre\u2212award interest includes\r\nboth pre\u2212 reference interest as well as pendente lite interest. Thus, the conclusion of\r\nthe Arbitrator that award of pendente lite interest was not prescribed by clause 17 of\r\nthe Agreement is not sustainable.\r\nAccordingly, the impugned award to the extent of award of pendente lite interest is set aside. The\r\npetition is disposed of. No orders as to costs.\u201D\r\n6. As noticed above, the Division Bench of the High Court has upheld the judgment and order of the\r\nLearned Single Judge in the impugned order.\r\n7. On 03.07.2018, this Court issued notice observing as under:\r\n\u201CLearned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on an order of this Court in\r\nAmbica Construction v. Union of India, (2017) 14 SCC 323.\u201D\r\n8. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials on record. Mr. Sanjay\r\nBansal, learned counsel for the appellant, contended that the learned Arbitrator had taken a\r\nplausible view, in terms of the Clause 17 of the Contract and held that the said clause does not bar\r\nthe payment of interest for pendente lite period. This argument was advanced in view of judgment of\r\nthis Court in Ambica Construction v. Union of India1, wherein the appellant was entitled for the\r\npayment of interest for the pendente lite period. He has also relied on another judgment of this\r\nCourt in Raveechee and Company v. Union of India2 in support of his contentions. Further, it was\r\nargued by the learned counsel that the Clause 17 of the Contract barring payment of interest to the\r\ncontractor on any sum due to the contractor, is ultra vires and against the provisions of Section 28\r\nof the Indian Contract Act, 1872.\r\n9. On the other hand, Mr. Pallav Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent, submitted that Section\r\n31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act gives paramount importance to the contract entered into between the\r\nparties and categorically restricts the power of an arbitrator to award pre\u2212reference and pendente\r\nlite interest when the parties themselves have agreed to the contrary. He argued that if the contract\r\nitself contains a specific clause which expressly bars the payment of interest, then it is not open for\r\nthe arbitrator to grant pendente lite interest. It was further argued that Ambica 1 (2017) 14 SCC 323\r\n2 (2018) 7 SCC 664 Construction (supra) is not applicable to the instant case because it was decided\r\nunder the Arbitration Act, 1940 whereas the instant case falls under the 1996 Act. It was further\r\nargued that Section 3 of the Interest Act confers power on the Court to allow interest in the\r\nproceedings for recovery of any debt or damages or in proceedings in which a claim for interest in\r\nrespect of any debt or damages already paid. However, Section 3(3) of the Interest Act carves out an\r\nexception and recognizes the right of the parties to contract out of the payment of interest arising\r\nout of any debt or damages and sanctifies contracts which bars the payment of interest arising out of\r\ndebt or damages. Therefore, Clause 17 of the Contract is not violative of any the provisions of the\r\nIndian Contract Act, 1872. In light of the arguments advanced, the learned counsel prays for\r\ndismissal of the appeal.\r\n10. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel for both the parties made at\r\nthe Bar. The law relating to award of pendente lite interest by Arbitrator under the 1996 Act is no\r\nlonger res integra. The provisions of the 1996 Act give paramount importance to the contract\r\nentered into between the parties and categorically restricts the power of an arbitrator to award pre\u2212\r\nreference and pendente lite interest when the parties themselves have agreed to the contrary.\r\nSection 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act which deals with the payment of interest is as under :\r\n\u201C31(7)(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and insofar as an arbitral\r\naward is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for\r\nwhich the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or\r\nany part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on\r\nwhich the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made.\u201D\r\n11. It is clear from the above provision that if the contract prohibits pre\u2212reference and pendente lite\r\ninterest, the arbitrator cannot award interest for the said period. In the present case, clause barring\r\ninterest is very clear and categorical. It uses the expression \u201Cany moneys due to the contractor\u201D by\r\nthe employer which includes the amount awarded by the arbitrator.\r\n12. In Sayeed Ahmed and Company v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.3 this Court has held that a\r\nprovision has been made under Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act in relation to the power of the 3\r\n(2009) 12 SCC 26 arbitrator to award interest. As per this section, if the contract bars payment of\r\ninterest, the arbitrator cannot award interest from the date of cause of action till the date of award.\r\n13. In Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions v. Divisional Railway Manager (Works), Palghat & Ors.\r\n4 it was held by this Court that where the parties had agreed that the interest shall not be payable,\r\nthe Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest between the date on which the cause of action arose to\r\nthe date of the award.\r\n14. Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited v. Globe Hi\u2212Fabs Limited 5 is an identical case where this\r\nCourt has held as under :\r\n\u201C16. In the present case we noticed that the clause barring interest is very widely\r\nworded. It uses the words \u201Cany amount due to the contractor by the employer\u201D. In our\r\nopinion, these words cannot be read as ejusdem generis along with the earlier words\r\n\u201Cearnest money\u201D or \u201Csecurity deposit\u201D.\u201D\r\n15. In Sri Chittaranjan Maity v. Union of India6 it was categorically held that if a contract prohibits\r\naward of interest for pre\u2212award period, the arbitrator cannot award interest for the said period.\r\n4 (2010) 8 SCC 767 5 (2015) 5 SCC 718 6 (2017) 9 SCC 611\r\n16. Therefore, if the contract contains a specific clause which expressly bars payment of interest,\r\nthen it is not open for the arbitrator to grant pendente lite interest. The judgment on which reliance\r\nwas placed by the learned counsel for the appellant in Ambica Construction (supra) has no\r\napplication to the instant case because Ambica Construction was decided under the Arbitration Act\r\n1940 whereas the instant case falls under the 1996 Act. This has been clarified in Sri Chittaranjan\r\nMaity (supra) as under :\r\n\u201C16. Relying on a decision of this Court in Ambica Construction v. Union of India,\r\n(2017) 14 SCC 323, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that mere\r\nbar to award interest on the amounts payable under the contract would not be\r\nsufficient to deny payment on pendente lite interest. Therefore, the arbitrator was\r\njustified in awarding the pendente lite interest. However, it is not clear from Ambica\r\nConstruction (supra) as to whether it was decided under the Arbitration Act, 1940\r\n(for short \u201Cthe 1940 Act\u201D) or under the 1996 Act. It has relied on a judgment of\r\nConstitution Bench in State of Orissa v. G.C. Roy, (1992) 1 SCC 508. This judgment\r\nwas with reference to the 1940 Act. In the 1940 Act, there was no provision which\r\nprohibited the arbitrator from awarding interest for the pre\u2212 reference, pendente lite\r\nor post\u2212award period, whereas the 1996 Act contains a specific provision which says\r\nthat if the agreement prohibits award of interest for the pre\u2212award period, the\r\narbitrator cannot award interest for the said period. Therefore, the decision in\r\nAmbica Construction (supra) cannot be made applicable to the instant case.\u201D\r\n17. The decision in Raveechee and Company (supra) relied on by the learned counsel for the\r\nappellant is again under the Arbitration Act 1940 which has no application to the facts of the present\r\ncase.\r\n18. Having regard to the above, we are of the view that the High Court was justified in rejecting the\r\nclaim of the appellant seeking pendente lite interest on the award amount.\r\n19. This takes us to the next question as to whether Clause 17 of the Contract is ultra vires in terms of\r\nSection 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. According to Section 28, a contract is void to the extent\r\nit restricts absolutely a party from enforcing his rights by usual proceedings in ordinary courts or if\r\nit limits the time within which he may enforce his rights. Exception I to this section contains a rule\r\nthat a contract by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which has arisen or which may\r\narise between them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration is not\r\nillegal. The question, therefore, is whether the contracts barring payment of interest extinguish the\r\nrights of the parties. Exception 1 to Section 28 reads as under :\r\n\u201CException 1: Saving of contract to refer to arbitration dispute that may arise. \u2013 This\r\nsection shall not render illegal a contract, by which two or more persons agree that\r\nany dispute which may arise between them in respect of any subject or class of\r\nsubjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only the amount awarded in such\r\narbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred.\u201D\r\n20. Exception I to Section 28 saves contracts where the right to move the Court for appropriate\r\nrelief is restricted but where the parties have agreed to resolve their dispute through arbitration.\r\nThus, a lawful agreement to refer the matter to arbitration can be made a condition precedent before\r\ngoing to courts and it does not violate Section 28. No cause of action then accrues until the\r\nArbitrator has made the award and the only amount awarded in such arbitration is recoverable in\r\nrespect of the dispute so referred. Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act which allows parties to waive any\r\nclaim to interest including pendente lite and the power of the Arbitrator to grant interest is subject\r\nto the agreement of the parties.\r\n21. It is pertinent to note that interest payments are governed in general by the Interest Act, 1978 in\r\naddition to the specific statutes that govern an impugned matter. Section 2 (a) of the Interest Act\r\ndefines a \u201CCourt\u201D which includes both a Tribunal and an Arbitrator. In turn, Section 3 allows a\r\n\u201CCourt\u201D to grant interest at prevailing interest rates in various cases. The provisions of Section 3 (3)\r\nof the Interest Act, 1978 explicitly allows the parties to waive their claim to an interest by virtue of\r\nan agreement. Section 3(3)(a)(ii) states that the Interest Act will not apply to situations where the\r\npayment of interest is \u201Cbarred by virtue of an express agreement\u201D.\r\n22. Thus, when there is an express statutory permission for the parties to contract out of receiving\r\ninterest and they have done so without any vitiation of free consent, it is not open for the Arbitrator\r\nto grant pendent lite interest. We are of the considered opinion that Clause 17 of the contract is not\r\nultra vires in terms of Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.\r\n23. In the result, the appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed. Having regard to the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the case, we direct the parties to bear their own costs.\r\n24. Pending application, if any, shall also stand disposed of.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J. (S.

The appellant herein was appointed as a Physical Training Teacher in St. Xavier\u2019s School, Nevta in\r\nthe year 2016. He was imparting Physical Training to the students from 1st to 5th standard. He was\r\nalso a member of the Disciplinary Committee for maintaining overall discipline by the students of\r\nthe School.\r\n4. One student of Class 9th of the institution, unfortunately, committed suicide in the morning at\r\nabout 04:00 AM on 26.04.2018. The mother of the deceased-student lodged the FIR in question on\r\n02.05.2018 before the concerned Police Station under Section 306 IPC after about 7 days of the\r\nsuicide, alleging that her son committed suicide due to mental harassment meted out by the\r\nappellant.\r\n5. Detailed facts as unfolded in the First Information Report by the complainant- Respondent No. 2\r\nwas that :\r\nOn 26.04.2018, my son Nitant Raj Lata, aged 14 years was found hanging with the\r\nfan in the room at 04:00 AM by his grandmother. Immediately, the knot was opened\r\nand after bringing him down, he was immediately taken to Santkba Durlabhji\r\nHospital where doctors declared him brought dead. The Hospital administration\r\ninformed the concerned Police Station immediately and on the same day, the body of\r\ndeceased was handed over to the police and postmortem was conducted. It is further\r\nstated in the FIR that on 19.04.2018, Nitant Raj (the deceased) informed her that on\r\nthe said day his PTI (Physical Training Instructor) GEO Sir had harassed and\r\ninsulted him in the presence of everyone because of which he was under deep mental\r\npressure. However, she persuaded her son and sent him to the School on Monday.\r\nThereafter, on 25.04.2018, when the child was in the School, a telephone call was\r\nreceived from school at about 09:00 AM calling the parents to come to the school on\r\nthe next day i.e., 26.04.2018. When Nitant returned from the school on 25.04.2018\r\nagain he was under very much pressure and on being inquired he told that today\r\nagain GEO PTI Sir has harassed and insulted him very much. On this she persuaded\r\nthe child that we will go to school tomorrow and will discuss because a phone call\r\ncame from the school. Thereafter, the child had been under more severe pressure and\r\ntension. He went to his room to sleep and was found hanging at about 04:00 AM. It\r\nis further stated that on 30.04.2018 at 11:00 AM, Assistant Sub-Inspector Shri Kallu\r\nKhan, came to the house and searched his room where a suicide note in two pages\r\nand curtain which was used for hanging and other items like a blank copy from which\r\ntwo pages were torn and note book, etc. were recovered.\r\n6. Heard Shri Abhishek Gupta, learned Counsel for the appellant, Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned\r\ncounsel for the State-Respondent No. 1 and Mr. Aditya Kumar Chaudhary, learned counsel for the\r\nState-Respondent No. 2. We have also gone through the impugned judgment as also the record of\r\nthe case with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties.\r\n7. Shri Abhishek Gupta, learned counsel for the appellant vehemently contended that on a plain\r\nreading of the First Information Report, by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that necessary\r\ningredients to constitute an offence of abetment, as defined under Section 306 IPC, are not borne\r\nout and the complaint does not disclose the commission of the said offence.\r\n8. It was further asserted that the allegations made in the FIR clearly spells out that appellant in no\r\nmanner abetted the commission of suicide by the deceased as no such material exists on record and\r\npresent proceedings if allowed to continue would be nothing but an abuse of the process of law.\r\n9. Shri Abhishek Gupta, also took us through the suicide note which is filed as Annexure P-2. A\r\nperusal of the same reveals that it is a note consisting of three pages with following written on each\r\nseparate paper :-\r\n01st page \u2013 \u2018MY ALL THINGS GOES TO MY DEAR BRO KAIRN EVEN MY LOVE\r\nBYE BUDDY & SORRY\u2019 02nd page \u2013 \u2018NEEDED JUSTICE\u2019 03rd page \u2013 \u2018THANKS\r\nGEO (PTI) OF MY SCHOOL\u2019\r\n10. Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Rajasthan contends that\r\nthe allegations in the FIR discloses a commission of cognizable offence and there is a suicide note\r\nspecifically taking the name of the appellant. He further contends that the appellant harassed the\r\ndeceased from 19.04.2018 till 24.04.2018 and ultimately on the complaint of the appellant when the\r\ndeceased was called by the Principal on 25.04.2018 for bunking classes and the parents were also\r\nasked to come to school on 26.04.2018, the deceased committed suicide on the intervening night of\r\n25.04.2018 - 26.04.2018 and there is a proximate nexus in the harassment and suicide and thus, a\r\nprima facie case for alleged cognizable offence is made out against the appellant and the High Court\r\nhas rightly refused to quash the First Information Report.\r\n11. Shri Aditya Kumar Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing for Respondent No. 2 \u2013 \u2018the\r\nComplainant\u2019, while trying to defend the impugned order submits that the impugned First\r\nInformation Report clearly makes out that appellant\u2019s direct and indirect acts of humiliation,\r\nharassment led the deceased boy to commit suicide. He further submitted that the question of mens\r\nrea attributable to the appellant cannot be established at this stage when the investigation is yet to\r\nbe completed.\r\n12. We have considered the rival contentions of the learned counsel appearing for the parties and\r\nperused the entire records.\r\n13. In our country, while suicide in itself is not an offence as a person committing suicide goes\r\nbeyond the reach of law but an attempt to suicide is considered to be an offence under Section 309\r\nIPC. The abetment of suicide by anybody is also an offence under Section 306 IPC. It would be\r\nrelevant to set out Section 306 of the IPC which reads as under :-\r\n\u201C306. Abetment of suicide.\u2014If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the\r\ncommission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either\r\ndescription for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\u201D\r\n14. Though, the IPC does not define the word \u2018Suicide\u2019 but the ordinary dictionary meaning of\r\nsuicide is \u2018self-killing\u2019. The word is derived from a modern latin word \u2018suicidium\u2019 , \u2018sui\u2019 means\r\n\u2018oneself\u2019 and \u2018cidium\u2019 means \u2018killing\u2019. Thus, the word suicide implies an act of \u2018self-killing\u2019. In other\r\nwords, act of death must be committed by the deceased himself, irrespective of the means adopted\r\nby him in achieving the object of killing himself.\r\n15. Section 306 of IPC makes abetment of suicide a criminal offence and prescribes punishment for\r\nthe same. Abetment is defined under Section 107 of IPC which reads as under :-\r\n\u201C107. Abetment of a thing - A person abets the doing of a thing, who\u2014\r\nFirst.\u2014Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly.\u2014Engages with one or\r\nmore other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act\r\nor illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the\r\ndoing of that thing; or Thirdly.\u2014Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the\r\ndoing of that thing.\r\nExplanation 1.\u2014A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment\r\nof a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or\r\nattempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that\r\nthing. Explanation 2.\u2014Whoever either prior to or at the time of the commission of an\r\nact, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby\r\nfacilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.\u201D\r\n16. The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word \u2018instigate\u2019 is to bring about or initiate, incite\r\nsomeone to do something. This Court in the case of Ramesh Kumar Vs. State of Chhattisgarh1 has\r\ndefined the word \u2018instigate\u2019 as under :-\r\n\u201CInstigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do an act.\u201D\r\n17. The scope and ambit of Section 107 IPC and its co-relation with Section 306 IPC has been\r\ndiscussed repeatedly by this Court. In the case of S.S.Cheena Vs. Vijay Kumar Mahajan and Anr.2, it\r\nwas observed as under:-\r\n\u201CAbetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a\r\nperson in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to\r\ninstigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be\r\n1. (2001) 9 SCC 618\r\n2. (2010) 12 SCC 190 sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the\r\ncases decided by the Supreme Court is clear that in order to convict a person under\r\nSection 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also\r\nrequires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing\r\nno option and that act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a\r\nposition that he committed suicide.\u201D\r\n18. In a recent pronouncement, a two-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Arnab\r\nManoranjan Goswami Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. 3, while considering the\r\nco-relation of Section 107 IPC with Section 306 IPC has observed as under :-\r\n\u201C47. The above decision thus arose in a situation where the High Court had declined\r\nto entertain a petition for quashing an FIR under Section 482 of the 14 (2014) 4 SCC\r\n453 PART I 33 CrPC. However, it nonetheless directed the investigating agency not to\r\narrest the accused during the pendency of the investigation. This was held to be\r\nimpermissible by this Court. On the other hand, this Court clarified that the High\r\nCourt if it thinks fit, having regard to the parameters for quashing and the self\r\nrestraint imposed by law, has the jurisdiction to quash the investigation \u2015and may\r\npass appropriate interim orders as thought apposite in law. Clearly therefore, the\r\nHigh Court in the present case has misdirected itself in declining to enquire prima\r\nfacie on a petition for quashing whether the parameters in the exercise of that\r\njurisdiction have been duly established and if so whether a case for the grant of\r\ninterim bail has been made out. The settled principles which have been consistently\r\nreiterated since the judgment of this Court in State of Haryana vs Bhajan Lal(Bhajan\r\nLal) include a situation where the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint, even\r\nif they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie\r\nconstitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. This legal position was\r\nrecently\r\n3. (2021) 2 SCC 427 reiterated in a decision by a two-judge Bench of this Court in\r\nKamal Shivaji Pokarnekar vs State of Maharashtra.\r\n48. The striking aspect of the impugned judgment of the High Court spanning over\r\nfifty-six pages is the absence of any evaluation even prima facie of the most basic\r\nissue.\r\nThe High Court, in other words, failed to apply its mind to a 15 1992 Supp. 1 SCC 335 16 (2019) 14\r\nSCC 350 PART I 34 fundamental issue which needed to be considered while dealing with a petition\r\nfor quashing under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 of the CrPC. The High Court, by\r\nits judgment dated 9 November 2020, has instead allowed the petition for quashing to stand over\r\nfor hearing a month later, and therefore declined to allow the appellant\u2018s prayer for interim bail and\r\nrelegated him to the remedy under Section 439 of the CrPC. In the meantime, liberty has been the\r\ncasualty. The High Court having failed to evaluate prima facie whether the allegations in the FIR,\r\ntaken as they stand, bring the case within the fold of Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC,\r\nthis Court is now called upon to perform the task.\u201D\r\n19. In the case of M. Arjunan Vs. State, Represented by its Inspector of Police4, a two-Judge Bench\r\nof this Court has expounded the ingredients of Section 306 IPC in the following words:-\r\n\u201CThe essential ingredients of the offence under Section 306 I.P.C. are: (i) the\r\nabetment; (ii) the intention of the accused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to\r\ncommit suicide. The act of the accused, however, insulting the deceased by using\r\nabusive language will not, by itself, constitute the abetment of suicide. There should\r\nbe evidence capable of suggesting that the accused intended by such act to instigate\r\nthe deceased to commit suicide.\r\nUnless the ingredients of instigation\/abetment to commit suicide are satisfied, accused cannot be\r\nconvicted under Section 306 I.P.C.\u201D\r\n4. (2019) 3 SCC 315\r\n20. At this stage, we may also refer to another recent judgment of a two- Judge Bench of this Court\r\nin the case of Ude Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana5, which elucidated on the essential ingredients\r\nof the offence under Section 306 IPC in the following words:-\r\n\u201C16. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there must be a proof of direct or indirect\r\nact\/s of incitement to the commission of suicide. It could hardly be disputed that the\r\nquestion of cause of a suicide, particularly in the context of an offence of abetment of\r\nsuicide, remains a vexed one, involving multifaceted and complex attributes of\r\nhuman behaviour and responses\/reactions. In the case of accusation for abetment of\r\nsuicide, the Court would be looking for cogent and convincing proof of the act\/s of\r\nincitement to the commission of suicide. In the case of suicide, mere allegation of\r\nharassment of the deceased by another person would not suffice unless there be such\r\naction on the part of the accused which compels the person to commit suicide; and\r\nsuch an offending action ought to be proximate to the time of occurrence. Whether a\r\nperson has abetted in the commission of suicide by another or not, could only be\r\ngathered from the facts and circumstances of each case.\r\n16.1. For the purpose of finding out if a person has abetted commission of suicide by\r\nanother; the consideration would be if the accused is guilty of the act of instigation of\r\nthe act of suicide. As explained and reiterated by this Court in the decisions\r\nabove-referred, instigation means to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage\r\nto do an act. If the persons who committed suicide had been hypersensitive and the\r\naction of accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly\r\ncircumstanced person to commit suicide, it may not be safe to hold the accused guilty\r\nof abetment of suicide. But, on the other hand, if the accused by his acts and by his\r\ncontinuous course of conduct creates a situation which\r\n5. (2019) 17 SCC 301 leads the deceased perceiving no other option except to commit\r\nsuicide, the case may fall within the four-corners of Section 306 IPC. If the accused\r\nplays an active role in tarnishing the self-esteem and self-respect of the victim, which\r\neventually draws the victim to commit suicide, the accused may be held guilty of\r\nabetment of suicide. The question of mens rea on the part of the accused in such\r\ncases would be examined with reference to the actual acts and deeds of the accused\r\nand if the acts and deeds are only of such nature where the accused intended nothing\r\nmore than harassment or snap show of anger, a particular case may fall short of the\r\noffence of abetment of suicide.\r\nHowever, if the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words or deeds until the\r\ndeceased reacted or was provoked, a particular case may be that of abetment of suicide. Such being\r\nthe matter of delicate analysis of human behaviour, each case is required to be examined on its own\r\nfacts, while taking note of all the surrounding factors having bearing on the actions and psyche of\r\nthe accused and the deceased.\u201D\r\n21. We may also refer to a two-Judge Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Narayan Malhari\r\nThorat Vs. Vinayak Deorao Bhagat and Anr., 6 wherein the judgement rendered by the High Court\r\nquashing the FIR under Section 482 was set aside. In the said case, an FIR was registered under\r\nSection 306 IPC stating that the son and daughter-in-law were teachers in a Zila Parishad School\r\nwhere the accused was also a teacher used to make frequent calls on the mobile of the\r\ndaughter-in-law, and used to harass her. Despite the efforts of the son of the informant in trying to\r\nmake the accused see reason and stop calling, the accused continued with his activity. On\r\n09.02.2015, there was a verbal altercation between the son of the informant and the accused and on\r\n6. (2019) 13 SCC 598 12.02.2015, he committed suicide leaving a note stating that his family life has\r\nbeen ruined by the accused who should not be pardoned and should be hanged. Under Section 482\r\nCr.PC, a petition was filed by the accused challenging the FIR, which was allowed by the High Court\r\nand thereafter, was challenged before this Court. The appeal was allowed by this Court and made the\r\nfollowing observations:-\r\n\u201CWe now consider the facts of the present case. There are definite allegations that the\r\nfirst respondent would keep on calling the wife of the victim on her mobile and keep\r\nharassing her which allegations are supported by the statements of the mother and\r\nthe wife of the victim recorded during investigation. The record shows that 3-4 days\r\nprior to the suicide there was an altercation between the victim and the first\r\nrespondent. In the light of these facts, coupled with the fact that the suicide note\r\nmade definite allegation against first respondent, the High Court was not justified in\r\nentering into question whether the first respondent had the requisite intention to aid\r\nor instigate or abate the commission of suicide. At this juncture when the\r\ninvestigation was yet to be completed and charge-sheet, if any, was yet to be filed, the\r\nHigh Court ought not to have gone into the aspect whether there was requisite mental\r\nelement or intention on part of the respondent.\u201D In the above quoted observations of\r\nthis Court, there is a clear indication that there was a specific averment in the FIR\r\nthat the respondent had continuously harassed the spouse of the victim and did not\r\nrectify his conduct despite being objected by the victim. Thus, as a matter of fact he\r\nhad actively facilitated in the commission of suicide.\r\n22. What is required to constitute an alleged abetment of suicide under Section 306\r\nIPC is there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the\r\ncommission of offence of suicide and mere allegations of harassment of the deceased\r\nby another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of\r\nsuch actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide.\r\nFurther, if the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the allegations\r\nattributed to the accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly\r\nsituated person to take the extreme step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to\r\nhold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide. Thus, what is required is an\r\nexamination of every case on its own facts and circumstances and keeping in\r\nconsideration the surrounding circumstances as well, which may have bearing on the\r\nalleged action of the accused and the psyche of the deceased.\r\n23. In the backdrop of the above discussion, we may now advert to the facts of the\r\npresent case to test whether the ingredients of offence under Section 306 IPC exist,\r\neven prima-facie, to continue with the investigations.\r\n24. The FIR recites that victim boy was under deep mental pressure because the\r\nappellant herein had harassed and insulted him in the presence of everyone and he\r\nwas not willing to go to school on 25.04.2018 but was persuaded to go to school by\r\nthe complainant. When he returned from the school, again he was under very much\r\npressure and on being enquired told that today again he was harassed and insulted by\r\nthe GEO, PTI Sir (the appellant). The boy was informed that the parents have been\r\ncalled to school next day and this brought him under further severe pressure and\r\ntension.\r\n25. In the First Information Report and as also the statement of the complainant\r\nrecorded by the police, no reasons or cause for the appellant to harass and insult the\r\nvictim are spelled out nor there are any details with respect to any action on the part\r\nof the appellant by which the deceased boy might have felt being harassed and\r\ninsulted.\r\n26. The appellant in his petition under Section 482 CrPC before the High Court has\r\nset out detailed facts and circumstances, which unfortunately the High Court failed to\r\neven take notice of much less analyse the same before coming to the conclusion. It\r\nwas stated in the petition that as a PT Teacher, he was imparting Physical Training to\r\nthe students from 1st to 5th standard and being a member of the Disciplinary\r\nCommittee, was also charged with the duty of maintaining discipline in the school\r\nwhich included keeping a watch upon students and oversee that they are attending\r\nthe classes instead of bunking the same and moving around in the school premises\r\nwithout permission. It was also stated that the victim, a student of class 9, generally\r\nused to bunk his classes and was warned by the appellant and other school staff a\r\nnumber of times. On 19.04.2018, he was caught by the appellant bunking classes and\r\nmoving around the school campus without any cause or permission and a warning\r\nwas given to him. On 25.04.2018, he was caught bunking classes and again the\r\nappellant issued him a warning and on account of persistent act of bunking classes,\r\nreported the same to the Principal of the School, who informed the parents of the boy\r\nto come to the school.\r\n27. It is a solemn duty of a teacher to instil discipline in the students. It is not\r\nuncommon that teachers reprimand a student for not being attentive or not being\r\nupto the mark in studies or for bunking classes or not attending the school. The\r\ndisciplinary measures adopted by a teacher or other authorities of a school,\r\nreprimanding a student for his indiscipline, in our considered opinion, would not\r\ntantamount to provoking a student to commit suicide, unless there are repeated\r\nspecific allegations of harassment and insult deliberately without any justifiable\r\ncause or reason. A simple act of reprimand of a student for his behaviour or\r\nindiscipline by a teacher, who is under moral obligations to inculcate the good\r\nqualities of a human being in a student would definitely not amount to instigation or\r\nintentionally aid to the commission of a suicide by a student.\r\n28. \u2018Spare the rod and spoil the child\u2019 an old saying may have lost its relevance in\r\npresent days and Corporal punishment to the child is not recognised by law but that\r\ndoes not mean that a teacher or school authorities have to shut their eyes to any\r\nindiscipline act of a student. It is not only a moral duty of a teacher but one of the\r\nlegally assigned duty under Section 24 (e) of the Right of Children to Free and\r\nCompulsory Education Act, 2009 to hold regular meetings with the parents and\r\nguardians and apprise them about the regularity in attendance, ability to learn,\r\nprogress made in learning and any other act or relevant information about the child.\r\n29. Thus, the appellant having found the deceased boy regularly bunking classes, first\r\nreprimanded him but on account of repeated acts, brought this fact to the knowledge\r\nof the Principal, who called the parents on telephone to come to the school. No\r\nfurther overt act has been attributed to the appellant either in the First Information\r\nReport or in the statement of the complainant, nor anything in this regard has been\r\nstated in the alleged suicide note. The alleged suicide note only records insofar as, the\r\nappellant is concerned, \u2018THANKS GEO (PTI) OF MY SCHOOL\u2019. Thus, even the\r\nsuicide note does not attribute any act or instigation on the part of the appellant to\r\nconnect him with the offence for which he is being charged.\r\n30. If, a student is simply reprimanded by a teacher for an act of indiscipline and\r\nbringing the continued act of indiscipline to the notice of Principal of the institution\r\nwho conveyed to the parents of the student for the purposes of school discipline and\r\ncorrecting a child, any student who is very emotional or sentimental commits suicide,\r\ncan the said teacher be held liable for the same and charged and tried for the offence\r\nof abetment of suicide under section 306 IPC.\r\n31. Our answer to the said question is 'No'.\r\n32. Considering the facts that the appellant holds a post of a teacher and any act done\r\nin discharge of his moral or legal duty without their being any circumstances to even\r\nremotely indicate that there was any intention on his part to abet the commission of\r\nsuicide by one of his own pupil, no mens rea can be attributed. Thus, the very\r\nelement of abetment is conspicuously missing from the allegations levelled in the\r\nFIR. In the absence of the element of abetment missing from the allegations, the\r\nessential ingredients of offence under section 306 IPC do not exist.\r\n33. All these facts have been clearly ignored by the High Court while mechanically\r\ndismissing the petition under Section 482 CrPC on the ground that FIR discloses the\r\ncommission of a cognizable offence.\r\n34. The scope and ambit of inherent powers of the Court under Section 482 CrPC or\r\nthe extra-ordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, now stands\r\nwell defined by series of judicial pronouncements. Undoubtedly, every High Court\r\nhas inherent power to act ex debito justitiae i.e., to do real and substantial justice, or\r\nto prevent abuse of the process of the Court. The powers being very wide in itself\r\nimposes a solemn duty on the Courts, requiring great caution in its exercise. The\r\nCourt must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on\r\nsound principles. The inherent power vested in the Court should not be exercised to\r\nstifle a legitimate prosecution. However, the inherent power or the extra-ordinary\r\npower conferred upon the High Court, entitles the said Court to quash a proceeding,\r\nif it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an\r\nabuse of the process of the Court, or the ends of justice require that the proceeding\r\nought to be quashed.\r\n35. The following observations made by this Court in the case of State of Karnataka\r\nVs. L. Muniswamy & Ors.7 may be relevant to note at this stage:-\r\n\u201CThe whole some power under Section 482 CrPC entitles the High Court to quash a\r\nproceeding when it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue\r\nwould be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that\r\nthe proceeding ought to be quashed. The High Courts have been invested with\r\ninherent power, both in civil and criminal matters, to achieve a salutary public\r\npurposes. A Court proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon\r\nof harassment or persecution. The Court observed in this case that ends of justice are\r\nhigher than the ends of mere law though justice\r\n7. (1977) 2 SCC 699 must be administered according to laws made by the legislature.\u201D\r\n36. Again in Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia & Anr. Vs. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao\r\nAngre & Ors.8, this Court observed in paragraph 7 as under :-\r\n\u201C7. The legal position is well-settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is\r\nasked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the\r\nuncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the\r\ncourt to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case\r\nto consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a\r\nprosecution to continue. This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for\r\nany oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an ultimate\r\nconviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing\r\na criminal prosecution to continue, the court may while taking into consideration the\r\nspecial facts of a case also quash the proceeding even though it may be at a\r\npreliminary stage.\u201D\r\n37. In State of Haryana & Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal & Ors. 9, this Court held that it may not\r\nbe possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and inflexible guidelines or rigid\r\nformulae and to specify an exhaustive list of the cases, where such power should be\r\nexercised. However, by way of illustration, the Court laid down the following\r\ncategories of cases wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of\r\nthe process of the Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.\r\n8. (1988) 1 SCC 692\r\n9. (1992) Supp (1) SCC 335 \u201C(1) Where the allegations made in the First Information\r\nReport or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in\r\ntheir entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the\r\naccused.\r\n(2) Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying\r\nthe F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under\r\nSection 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section\r\n155(2) of the Code.\r\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or 'complaint and the evidence collected\r\nin support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against\r\nthe accused.\r\n(4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a\r\nnon-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a\r\nMagistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2)of the Code.\r\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on\r\nthe basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground\r\nfor proceeding against the accused.\r\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the\r\nconcerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance\r\nof the proceedings and\/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,\r\nproviding efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.\r\n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and\/or where the proceeding\r\nis maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a\r\nview to spite him due to private and personal grudge.\u201D\r\n38. In the case of M\/s.Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. & Ors. Vs. Mohd. Sharaful Haque &\r\nAnr.10, this Court observed as under :-\r\n\u201CIt would be an abuse of process of the court to allow any action which would result\r\nin injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers court would\r\nbe justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation\/continuance of it\r\namounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would\r\notherwise serve the ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint,\r\nthe court may examine the question of fact. When a complaint is sought to be\r\nquashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the complainant\r\nhas alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted\r\nin toto.\u201D\r\n39. Insofar as, the suicide note is concerned, despite our minute examination of the same, all we can\r\nsay is that suicide note is rhetoric document, penned down by an immature mind. A reading of the\r\nsame also suggests the hyper- sensitive temperament of the deceased which led him to take such an\r\nextra- ordinary step, as the alleged reprimand by the accused, who was his teacher, otherwise would\r\nnot ordinarily induce a similarly circumstanced student to commit suicide.\r\n10. (2005) 1 SCC 122\r\n40. In the absence of any material on record even, prima-facie, in the FIR or statement of the\r\ncomplainant, pointing out any such circumstances showing any such act or intention that he\r\nintended to bring about the suicide of his student, it would be absurd to even think that the\r\nappellant had any intention to place the deceased in such circumstances that there was no option\r\navailable to him except to commit suicide.\r\n41. In the absence of any specific allegation and material of definite nature, not imaginary or\r\ninferential one, it would be travesty of justice, to ask the appellant-accused to face the trial. A\r\ncriminal trial is not exactly a pleasant experience and the appellant who is a teacher would certainly\r\nsuffer great prejudice, if he has to face prosecution on absurd allegations of irrelevant nature.\r\n42. Bearing in mind the factual aspects of the case delineated herein above and the legal principles\r\nenunciated by a series of pronouncements of this Court discussed herein above, we are of the view\r\nthat High Court was not justified in dismissing the application under section 482 CrPC for quashing\r\nthe First Information Report in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.\r\n43. We are conscious of the pain and suffering of the complainant who is the mother of the deceased\r\nboy. It is also very unfortunate that a young life has been lost in this manner, but our sympathies\r\nand the pain and suffering of the complainant, cannot translate into a legal remedy, much less a\r\ncriminal prosecution.\r\n44. In view of above facts and discussions, the impugned judgment of the High Court dated\r\n30.04.2019 cannot be sustained and is hereby set aside. The First Information Report registered as\r\nCase No. 162 of 2018 at Police Station Sodala, Jaipur City (South), stands quashed.\r\n45. The appeal, accordingly, stands allowed.\r\n....\u2026..........................J. (S. ABDUL NAZEER) \u2026................................J. (KRISHNA MURARI) NEW\r\nDELHI;\r\n05 OCTOBER, 2021",

That the convict Shibhu Kahar\r\n@ Dodan @ Dhuma is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a\r\nfine of Rs.5,000\/- (five thousand), in default to pay fine to suffer S.I. for six months\r\nmore for offence u\/s 302\/34 I.P.C.\r\nThat the convict Kartic Das is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and to\r\npay a fine of Rs.5,000\/- (five thousand), in default to suffer S.I. for six months more\r\nfor the offence u\/s 302\/34 I.P.C.\r\nThat the convict Raju Rabidas @ Shera is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment\r\nfor life and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000\/- (five thousand), in default to pay fine to suffer\r\nS.I. for six months more than the offence u\/s 302\/34 I.P.C.\r\nThat the convict Biltu Bhattacharya is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for\r\nlife and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000\/- (five thousand), in default to pay fine to suffer six\r\nmonths more than the offence u\/s 302\/34 of the I.P.C.\u201D Being aggrieved, the\r\nconvicted accused preferred Criminal Appeals Nos.539 and 627 of 2013 and Criminal\r\nAppeal Nos.112 and 153 of 2014 in the High Court. By its judgment dated 13.03.2019,\r\nwhich is presently under challenge, the High Court affirmed the view taken by the\r\nTrial Court and dismissed said appeals.\r\nMr. Raj Kumar Gupta, learned Advocate appearing for the appellants invited our\r\nattention to the testimonies of two eye witnesses, namely, PW18 and PW19 and\r\nsubmitted that the delay in recording their statements under Sections 161 and 164 of\r\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 respectively would be fatal to the case of the\r\nprosecution. It was submitted that no explanation was forthcoming why there was\r\ndelay in recording their statements. Reliance was placed on the decisions of this\r\nCourt in Balakrushna Swain v. State of Orissa, (1971) 3 SCC 192; Alil Mollah &\r\nAnother v. State of West Bengal, (1996) 5 SCC 369; and, Shahid Khan v. State of\r\nRajasthan, (2016) 4 SCC 96.\r\nIt was further submitted by Mr. Gupta that apart from the testimonies of said two witnesses, there\r\nwas nothing on record to justify the conviction of the appellants.\r\nMs. Liz Mathew, learned Advocate appearing for the State on the other hand submitted that the\r\nterror unleashed by the accused was of such magnitude that the concerned witnesses had fled away\r\nin fear and that it was only after the appropriate steps were taken by the investigating machinery\r\nincluding the arrest of the accused that the witnesses came forward.\r\nMs. Mathew also submitted that apart from the eye-witness account, there were supporting pieces of\r\nmaterial in the form of recoveries which were conclusive in nature.\r\nIt is true that there was some delay in recording the statements of the concerned eye-witnesses but\r\nmere factum of delay by itself cannot result in rejection of their testimonies.\r\nThe material on record definitely establishes the fear created by the accused. If the witnesses felt\r\nterrorised and frightened and did not come forward for some time, the delay in recording their\r\nstatements stood adequately explained. Nothing has been brought on record to suggest that during\r\nthe interregnum, the witnesses were carrying on their ordinary pursuits.\r\nThus, the eye-witness account unfolded through PW18 and PW19 cannot be discarded. We have\r\ngone through their testimonies and are convinced that their statements were cogent, consistent and\r\ntrustworthy.\r\nWe, therefore, reject the submissions advanced by Mr. Raj Kumar Gupta, learned Advocate. On\r\nmerits, we do not find any reason to take a different view in the matter.\r\nAffirming the view taken by the Trial Court and the High Court, these appeals are dismissed.\r\n........................J.

It is submitted that the question\r\ninvolved in the present appeal is a pure question of law and therefore the same may be decided by\r\nthis Court even for future guidance.\r\n7.1 Learned counsel for the respondent has further submitted that, as such, the issue involved in the\r\npresent case is squarely covered against the appellant in view of the decision of this Court in the case\r\nof Goodyear India Limited v. Norton Intech Rubbers Private Limited, (2012) 6 SCC 345. It is\r\nsubmitted that the very provision of MSME Act, 2006 \u2013 Section 19 has been interpreted by this\r\nCourt and it is observed and held that requirement of deposit of 75% as a pre-deposit is mandatory.\r\nIt is submitted that even the expression \u201Cin the manner directed by such court\u201D in Section 19 has\r\nbeen interpreted by this Court and it is held that the expression \u201Cin the manner directed by such\r\ncourt\u201D would indicate the discretion given to the Court to allow the pre-deposit to be made, if felt\r\nnecessary, in instalments. It is submitted that otherwise the deposit of 75% as a pre-deposit is\r\nmandatory and the appellate court would have no discretion at all to deviate from the mandate\r\nunder Section 19 of the MSME Act, 2006.\r\n8. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant is not in a position to show any contrary\r\ndecision to the decision of this Court in the case of Goodyear India Limited (supra). He is also not in\r\na position to satisfy whether the appellate court would have any discretion to deviate from the\r\nrequirement of deposit of 75% as a pre-deposit while preferring the appeal\/application under\r\nSection 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act read with Section 19 of the MSME Act, 2006.\r\n9. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.\r\nThe short question posed for the consideration of this Court is, whether in an appeal\/application\r\nfiled under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 read with Section 19 of the MSME\r\nAct, 2006, the appellate court would have any discretion to deviate from deposit of 75% of the\r\nawarded amount as a pre-deposit?\r\n9.1 Section 19 of the MSME Act, 2006 reads as under:\r\n\u201C19. Application for setting aside decree, award or order \u2013 No application for setting\r\naside any decree, award or other order made either by the Council itself or by any\r\ninstitution or centre providing alternate dispute resolution services to which a\r\nreference is made by the Council, shall be entertained by any court unless the\r\nappellant (not being a supplier) has deposited with it seventy-five per cent of the\r\namount in terms of the decree, award or, as the case may be, the other order in the\r\nmanner directed by such court:\r\nProvided that pending disposal of the application to set aside the decree, award or\r\norder, the court shall order that such percentage of the amount deposited shall be\r\npaid to the supplier, as it considers reasonable under the circumstances of the case,\r\nsubject to such conditions as it deems necessary to impose.\u201D (bold words are ours) 9.2\r\nOn a plain\/fair reading of Section 19 of the MSME Act, 2006, reproduced\r\nhereinabove, at the time\/before entertaining the application for setting aside the\r\naward made under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, the\r\napplicant\/appellant has to deposit 75% of the amount in terms of the award as a\r\npre-deposit. The requirement of deposit of 75% of the amount in terms of the award\r\nas a pre-deposit is mandatory. However, at the same time, considering the hardship\r\nwhich may be projected before the appellate court and if the appellate court is\r\nsatisfied that there shall be undue hardship caused to the appellant\/applicant to\r\ndeposit 75% of the awarded amount as a predeposit at a time, the court may allow the pre-deposit to be made in instalments\r\n10. An identical question came to be considered by this Court in the case of Goodyear India Limited\r\n(supra). In paragraphs 10 & 11, this Court observed and held as under:\r\n\u201C10. In his submissions, Mr Ramachandran has referred to the various decisions, all\r\nof which, however, are in the context of enactments in which discretion has been left\r\nto the appellate body to either waive or reduce the amount of pre-deposit, which\r\nfactor is absent in the present case. In support of his contention, however, he referred\r\nto and relied upon the decision of this Court in Snehadeep Structures (P) Ltd. v.\r\nMaharashtra Small-Scale Industries Development Corpn. Ltd. (2010) 3 SCC 34\r\nwherein while considering the question as to whether an application under Section\r\n34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, could be treated to be an appeal, a\r\nquestion incidentally arose as to whether if the same was to be treated as an appeal,\r\nwould it be necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 19 of the 2006 Act.\r\nTheir Lordships observed that the provision, no doubt, requires pre-deposit to be\r\nmade before an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is filed, but that\r\nthey were not inclined to read that provision into the provision in question. The facts\r\nof the said case are different from the facts of this case and it would be difficult to\r\nimport the ratio of the decision in the above case into the facts of this case.\r\n11. Having considered the submissions made, both on behalf of the petitioner and on behalf of the\r\nrespondents, we do not see any reason to interfere with the views expressed, both by the learned\r\nSingle Judge, as also the Division Bench with regard to Section 19 of the 2006 Act. It may not be out\r\nof place to mention that the provisions of Section 19 of the 2006 Act, had been challenged before the\r\nKerala High Court in Kerala SRTC v. Union of India [(2010) 1 KLT 65], where the same submissions\r\nwere negated and, subsequently, the matter also came up to this Court, when the special leave\r\npetitions were dismissed, with leave to make the pre-deposit in the cases involved, within an\r\nextended period of ten weeks. We may also indicate that the expression \u201Cin the manner directed by\r\nsuch court\u201D would, in our view, indicate the discretion given to the court to allow the pre-deposit to\r\nbe made, if felt necessary, in instalments.\u201D\r\n11. In view of the above and considering the language used in Section 19 of the MSME Act, 2006 and\r\nthe object and purpose of providing deposit of 75% of the awarded amount as a pre-deposit while\r\npreferring the application\/appeal for setting aside the award, it has to be held that the requirement\r\nof deposit of 75% of the awarded amount as a pre- deposit is mandatory. Therefore, as such, both\r\nthe High Court as well as the learned Additional District Judge (Commercial), Dehradun were\r\njustified in directing the appellant to deposit 75% of the awarded amount as a pre-deposit.\r\nHowever, at the same time, considering the fact that while issuing notice in the present proceedings\r\non 23.10.2019, this Court passed the following order:\r\n\u201CPermission to file the special leave petition is granted.\r\nIn an appeal filed by the petitioner-Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority, a\r\nPublic Sector Undertaking of the State of Gujarat, challenging the award passed\r\nunder the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 by the\r\nFacilitation Council, pursuant to Section 19 of the said Act the petitioner-Authority\r\nwas directed to deposit 75% of the Award amount as conditional pre-deposit for\r\ntaking the appeal on file.\r\nBeing aggrieved by the direction for pre-deposit of the amount the\r\npetitioner-Authority has preferred this special leave petition.\r\nWe have heard Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel appearing for the\r\npetitioner-Authority, who has submitted that the entire amount payable to the\r\nrespondent-supplier has already been paid to the respondent- supplier and hence\r\nthere is no necessity to make pre-deposit for filing the appeal. Arguments advanced\r\nby learned senior counsel is on the merit of the matter.\r\nHaving regard to the facts and circumstances and considering the fact that the\r\npetitioner-Authority is a Public Sector Undertaking, in exercise of the discretion\r\nvested with the court under Section of the said Act, we direct the petitioner-Authority\r\nto deposit Rs.2,50,00,000\/- before the Appellate Authority within a period of four\r\nweeks from today. On such deposit, the District and Sessions Judge, Dehradun, is\r\ndirected to take up the appeal on file and proceed with the same.\r\nIssue notice to the respondent.\r\nOn deposit of Rs.2,50,00,000\/- (Rupees Two Crore Fifty Lakhs), the same shall be\r\ninvested in a fixed deposit in a nationalised bank for a period of three months with\r\nauto renewal so that it may enure to the benefit of the successful party and the\r\ndisbursement of the same shall await further orders from this Court.\u201D and directed\r\nthe appellant to deposit Rs. 2,50,00,000\/- (Rupees Two Crores Fifty Lakhs) and on\r\nsuch deposit the District and Sessions Judge, Dehradun was directed to take up the\r\nappeal on file and proceed with the same. It is reported that by now the\r\napplication\/appeal has been heard and the order is to be pronounced on 12.10.2021,\r\nwe continue with the arrangement as per order dated 23.10.2019 in the\r\nappeal\/application under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act is finally\r\ndecided and disposed of. We hope and trust that the learned Additional District\r\nJudge (Commercial), Dehradun shall pronounce the order at the earliest and more\r\nparticularly on 12.10.2021, the date on which order is to be pronounced, as reported.\r\n12. With the aforesaid, the question posed is answered against the appellant in terms\r\nof the above and we dispose of the appeal laying down the law in terms of the above,\r\nhowever, as observed hereinabove, continue with the interim arrangement as per\r\norder dated 23.10.2019 till final disposal of the appeal\/application under Section 34\r\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 read with Section 19 of the MSME Act,\r\n2006, which shall not be treated as a precedent.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

          "judgement":"M. R. Shah, J.\r\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 28.11.2019\r\npassed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in CRA-DB No.311 of 2018 by which\r\nthe High Reason: original accused and has confirmed the judgment and order of conviction and\r\nsentence passed by the Learned Special Court convicting the accused for the offence punishable\r\nunder Section 21 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter to be\r\nreferred to as \u2018the Act\u201D) and sentenced the accused to undergo 15 years R.I. and to pay a fine of Rs.2\r\nLakhs and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo one year R.I., original accused has\r\npreferred the present appeal.\r\n2. At the outset, it is required to be noted that vide earlier order dated 16.12.2020, this Court has\r\nrefused to interfere with the conviction of the appellant for an offence punishable under Section 21\r\nof the Act however, has issued notice confined to the question of sentence. Therefore, in the present\r\nappeal the question of sentence of 15 years R.I. with fine of Rs.2 Lakhs and in default to undergo\r\nfurther one year R.I. only is required to be considered.\r\n3. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently submitted that the\r\nminimum punishment\/sentence which is provided in Section 21 of the Act is 10 years. It is\r\nsubmitted that as per Section 32B of the Act where a minimum term of imprisonment or amount of\r\nfine is prescribed for any offence committed under the Act, the Court may in addition to such\r\nfactors, as it may deem fit, take into account the factors which are mentioned in Section 32B for\r\nimposing a punishment higher than the term of imprisonment or amount of fine. It is submitted\r\nthat therefore, by imposing the punishment higher than the minimum term of imprisonment i.e. in\r\nthe present case 15 years R.I., the Court has to take into consideration the factors mentioned in\r\nSection 32B of the Act and has to assign the reasons while imposing the punishment higher than the\r\nminimum term of imprisonment. It is submitted that in the present case while imposing a\r\npunishment of 15 years R.I. which is admittedly higher than the minimum term of imprisonment of\r\n10 years R.I., neither the Special Court nor the High Court have assigned any reasons taking into\r\naccount the factors mentioned in Section 32B of the Act.\r\n3.1 It is submitted that the appellant is the first time convict and is a poor person and was only a\r\ncarrier. It is further submitted by Learned Counsel for the appellant \u2013 accused that in the present\r\ncase the main supplier of the narcotic substance has not been apprehended\/arrested and the\r\nappellant-accused being a carrier, sentence higher than the minimum provided under the Act is not\r\nwarranted. It is submitted that factors contained in clauses (a) to (f) of Section 32B have not been\r\nconsidered by the Learned Special Court while imposing a sentence higher than the minimum\r\nsentence.\r\n3.2 For the aforesaid, some of the observations made by this Court in para 23 of the decision in the\r\ncase of Rafiq Qureshi vs. Narcotic Control Bureau, Eastern Zonal Unit, (2019) 6 SCC 492 has been\r\nrelied upon.\r\nLearned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant \u2013 original accused has further submitted that\r\nin the case of Rafiq Qureshi (Supra), this Court has reduced the sentence of 16 years to 12 years in a\r\ncase where the accused was found to be in possession of narcotic drugs which was much higher than\r\nthe commercial quantity i.e. 609.6 gm, as per the analysis report.\r\n3.3 Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant \u2013 accused has further submitted that this\r\nHon\u2019ble Court has time and again held that awarding of adequate sentence is a question of personal\r\nliberty protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of India and there is a requirement of giving due\r\nweightage to mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Reliance is placed on the decisions of this\r\nCourt in the case of Soman vs. State of Kerala, (2013) 11 SCC 382 and State of Haryana vs. Asha\r\nDevi, (2015) 8 SCC 39. It is submitted that in the present case mitigating circumstances are that (i)\r\nappellant is a poor man and only bread winner of the family; (ii) Trial Court found that the appellant\r\nshould be dealt with leniently while considering the question of sentence; (iii) appellant was merely\r\na carrier and the main accused Malkit Singh was never arrested and in fact no fruitful efforts were\r\nmade to arrest him; (iv) the appellant is the first time convict under the Act and there is no pending\r\ncase against the appellant under the Act and no special factors as stated in Section 32B (a) to (f) are\r\npresent in the facts and circumstances of the present case. It is submitted that against the above\r\nmitigating circumstances, the aggravating circumstances are (i) that the offence in respect to\r\ncommercial quantity under the Act and (ii) quantity of contraband recovered is four times the\r\ncommercial quantity. It is submitted that therefore the mitigating circumstances are more in favour\r\nof the accused and therefore in the facts and circumstances of the case the punishment\/sentence\r\nhigher than the minimum provided under the Act is not warranted.\r\n4. While opposing the present appeal, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent \u2013\r\nState has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case neither the Learned\r\nSpecial Court nor the High Court have committed any error in imposing the punishment of 15 years\r\nR.I., which is higher than the minimum sentence provided under the Act. It is submitted that in the\r\npresent case and as per the case of prosecution which has been established and proved, the accused\r\nwas selling the heroin. It is submitted that the accused was found to be in possession of 1 kg heroin\r\nwhich is much higher than the commercial quantity and four times greater than the minimum of the\r\ncommercial quantity. It is submitted that 250 gm is a minimum commercial quantity and in the\r\npresent case the accused was found to be in possession of 1 kg of heroin which is four times\r\nmore\/higher than the minimum commercial quantity provided under the Act. It is submitted that\r\neven in the case of Rafiq Qureshi (Supra) it is observed and held that the quantity of the narcotic\r\nsubstance recovered may be a relevant factor to impose punishment higher than the minimum and\r\nthus, quantity of substance with which accused is charged is a relevant factor, which can be taken\r\ninto consideration while fixing quantum of punishment. It is further observed and held that a\r\ndecision to impose a punishment higher than the minimum is not confined or limited to the factors\r\nas enumerated in clauses (a) to (f) of Section 32B and the Court\u2019s discretion to consider such factors\r\nas it may deem fit is not taken away or tinkered. It is submitted that in the aforesaid case though it\r\nwas found that the court has not adverted to the factors mentioned in clauses (a) to (f) of Section\r\n32B of the Act, considering the fact that quantity of manufactured drug being much much higher\r\nthan the minimum commercial quantity, this Court refused to interfere with the order passed by the\r\nLearned Special Court and the High Court imposing the sentence\/imprisonment higher than the\r\nminimum imprisonment mentioned in Section 21 of the Act. It is submitted that in that case on facts\r\nthe accused was found to be a carrier and therefore, this Court reduced the imprisonment from 16\r\nyears to 12 years R.I. It is submitted that in the present case the accused was found to be in\r\npossession of huge quantity of heroin i.e. 1 kg and was found to be selling narcotic substance\/drugs,\r\nthe sentence\/imprisonment imposed by the Learned Trial Court confirmed by the High Court of 15\r\nyears R.I. with fine of Rs.2 Lakhs is not required to be interfered with.\r\n5. Heard the Learned Counsel for the respective parties at length.\r\n6. As observed hereinabove, in the present case the appellant \u2013 original accused was found to be in\r\npossession of 1 kg heroin which is four times more than the minimum of commercial quantity. 250\r\ngm and above of Narcotic substance\/drug is a commercial quantity as per the NDPS Act. The\r\nminimum sentence provided under Section 21 of the Act is 10 years R.I. So far as the commercial\r\nquantity is concerned, it may be upto 20 years R.I. Therefore, the minimum sentence for\r\ncommercial quantity shall not be less than 10 years, which may extend to 20 years with fine which\r\nshall not be less than Rs.1 lakh but which may extend to Rs.2 lakhs. Section 32B of the Act provides\r\nfor factors to be taken into account for imposing higher than the minimum punishment. Section 32B\r\nof the Act reads as under:\r\n\u201C[32B. Factors to be taken into account for imposing higher than the minimum\r\npunishment.\u2014 Where a minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine is\r\nprescribed for any offence committed under this Act, the court may, in addition to\r\nsuch factors as it may deem fit, take into account the following factors for imposing a\r\npunishment higher than the minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine,\r\nnamely:\u2014\r\n(a) the use or threat of use of violence or arms by the offender;\r\n(b) the fact that the offender holds a public office and that he has taken advantage of\r\nthat office in committing the offence;\r\n(c) the fact that the minors are affected by the offence or the minors are used for the\r\ncommission of an offence;\r\n(d) the fact that the offence is committed in an educational institution or social\r\nservice facility or in the immediate vicinity of such institution or faculty or in other\r\nplace to which school children and students resort for educational, sports and social\r\nactivities;\r\n(e) the fact that the offender belongs to organised international or any other criminal\r\ngroup which is involved in the commission of the offence; and (f) the fact that the\r\noffender is involved in other illegal activities facilitated by commission of the\r\noffence.]\u201D Therefore, while imposing a punishment higher than the minimum term of\r\nthe imprisonment or an amount of fine, the Court may take into account the factors\r\nenumerated in Section 32B of the Act referred to hereinabove. However, it is required\r\nto be noted that Section 32B of the Act itself further provides that the Court may, in\r\naddition to such factors as it may deem fit, take into account the factors for imposing\r\na punishment higher than the minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine as\r\nmentioned in Section 32B of the Act. Therefore, while imposing the punishment\r\nhigher than the minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine, the Court may\r\ntake into account such factors as it may deem fit and also the factors\r\nenumerated\/mentioned in Section 32B of the Act. Therefore, on fair reading of\r\nSection 32B of the Act, it cannot be said that while imposing a punishment higher\r\nthan the minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine, the Court has to\r\nconsider only those factors which are mentioned\/enumerated in Section 32B of the\r\nAct. Identical question came to be considered by this Court in the case of Rafiq\r\nQureshi (Supra). While considering the statutory scheme mentioned in Section 32B\r\nof the Act, it is observed and held that Court may, where minimum term of\r\npunishment is prescribed, take into consideration \u201Csuch factors as it may deem fit\u201D\r\nfor imposing a punishment higher than the minimum term of imprisonment or fine\r\nand in addition take into account the factors for imposing a punishment higher than\r\nthe minimum as enumerated in clauses (a) to (f) of Section 32B. It is further observed\r\nand held that quantity of the substance with which accused is charged is a relevant\r\nfactor, which can be taken into consideration while fixing the quantum of\r\npunishment. In paragraph 15.1 to 16 and 18 it is observed and held as under:\r\n\u201C15.1 The court may where minimum term of punishment is prescribed take into\r\nconsideration such factors as it may deem fit for imposing a punishment higher than\r\nthe minimum term of imprisonment or fine;\r\n15.2 In addition, take into account the factors for imposing a punishment higher than\r\nthe minimum as enumerated in clause (a) to (f).\r\n16. The statutory scheme indicates that the decision to impose a punishment higher\r\nthan the minimum is not confined or limited to the factors enumerated in clauses (a)\r\nto (f). The Courts discretion to consider such factors as it may deem fit is not taken\r\naway or tinkered. In a case a person is found in possession of a manufactured drug\r\nwhose quantity is equivalent to commercial quantity, the punishment as per Section\r\n21(c) has to be not less than ten years which may extend to twenty years. But suppose\r\nthe quantity of manufactured drug is 20 time of the commercial quantity, it may be a\r\nrelevant factor to impose punishment higher than minimum. Thus, quantity of\r\nsubstance with which an accused is charged is a relevant factor, which can be taken\r\ninto consideration while fixing quantum of the punishment. Clauses (a) to (f) as\r\nenumerated in Section 32B do not enumerate any factor regarding quantity of\r\nsubstance as a factor for determining the punishment. In the event the Court takes\r\ninto consideration the magnitude of quantity with regard to which an accused is\r\nconvicted the said factor is relevant factor and the Court cannot be said to have\r\ncommitted an error when taking into consideration any such factor, higher than the\r\nminimum term of punishment is awarded.\r\n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026\r\n18. The specific words used in Section 32B that Court may, in addition to such factors\r\nas it may deem fit clearly indicates that Courts discretion to take such factor as it may\r\ndeem fit is not fettered by factors which are enumerated in clauses (a) to (f) of Section\r\n32B\u201D.\r\n6.1 Therefore, quantity of substance would fall into \u201Csuch factors as it may deem fit\u201D\r\nand while exercising its discretion of imposing the sentence\/imprisonment higher\r\nthan the minimum, if the Court has taken into consideration such factor of\r\nlarger\/higher quantity of substance, it cannot be said that the Court has committed\r\nan error. The Court has a wide discretion to impose the sentence\/imprisonment\r\nranging between 10 years to 20 years and while imposing such\r\nsentence\/imprisonment in addition, the Court may also take into consideration other\r\nfactors as enumerated in Section 32B (a) to (f). Therefore, while imposing a\r\npunishment higher than the minimum sentence, if the Court has considered such\r\nfactor as it may deem fit other than the factors enumerated in Section 32B (a) to (f),\r\nthe High Court has to only consider whether \u201Csuch factor\u201D is a relevant factor or not.\r\n6.2 Applying the aforesaid principles of law to the facts of the case on hand, it is\r\nrequired to be considered whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the\r\nsentence of 15 years R.I. with fine of Rs.2 Lakhs imposed by the Learned Special\r\nCourt and confirmed by the High Court require interference by this Court? While\r\nconsidering the request made on behalf of the accused to award lesser punishment\r\nand to take lenient view while sentencing him, the Special Court in fact has taken into\r\nconsideration the relevant facts\/factors while not imposing the maximum\r\npunishment of 20 years R.I. and awarding the sentence of 15 years R.I. Therefore, as\r\nsuch, it cannot be said that the Special Court has not at all applied its mind while\r\nawarding the sentence.\r\n6.3 Submission on behalf of the accused that the main supplier has not been\r\napprehended\/arrested and the appellant is a carrier only cannot be a ground to\r\ninterfere with the sentence imposed by the Learned Special Court confirmed by the\r\nHigh Court. In most of the cases the main supplier, who may be from outside country\r\nmay not be apprehended and\/or arrested. Once the accused is found to be in illegal\r\npossession of the narcotic substance\/drugs, if in the circumstances so warranted, can\r\nbe awarded the sentence higher than the minimum prescribed\/provided under the\r\nAct. 6.4 In the present case the appellant - accused was found to be in possession of 1\r\nkg heroin and he sold it to the informant. Therefore, he cannot be said to be a mere\r\ncarrier. In given case, even a carrier who is having the knowledge that he is carrying\r\nwith him narcotic substance\/drugs and is found to be with huge commercial quantity\r\nof narcotic substance\/drugs can be awarded the sentence higher than the minimum\r\nsentence provided under the Act. In the present case, as observed hereinabove, the\r\naccused was found to be in possession of 1 kg heroin and the minimum commercial\r\nquantity is 250 gm. Therefore, the accused was found to be in possession of 4 times\r\nhigher than the minimum commercial quantity and therefore, the sentence imposed\r\nby the Learned Special Court imposing the sentence of 15 years R.I. with fine of Rs.2\r\nlakhs, confirmed by the High Court is not required to be interfered with by this Court.\r\nIt cannot be said that while imposing such punishment the Court has taken into\r\nconsideration any irrelevant factors.\r\n7. Now so far as the submission on behalf of the accused that awarding of adequate\r\nsentence is question of personal liberty protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of\r\nIndia and there is requirement of giving due weightage to the mitigating and\r\naggravating circumstances and in the present case the mitigating circumstances in\r\nfavour of the accused are more than the aggravating circumstances and therefore the\r\npunishment higher than the minimum provided under the Act is not justified and\/or\r\nwarranted is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that the appellant is\r\nheld to be guilty for the offence under Section 21 of the Act and found to be in\r\npossession of 1 kg heroin which is four times more\/higher than the commercial\r\nquantity. At this stage, the statement of objects and reasons for enactment of NDPS\r\nAct are required to be referred to. Before the NDPS Act 1965 was enacted, the\r\nstatutory control over narcotic drugs was exercised in India through number of\r\nCentral and State enactments viz. \u2014 The Opium Act, 1857,\r\n(b) the Opium Act, 1878 and (c) The Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930.\r\nHowever, with the passage of time and developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and drug abuse\r\nat national and international level it was noticed and found that (i) The scheme of penalties under\r\nthe aforesaid ACTS was not sufficiently deterrent to meet the challenge of well- organized gangs of\r\nsmugglers; (ii) The country has for the last few years been increasingly facing the problem of transit\r\ntraffic of drugs coming mainly from the neighboring countries and destined mainly to Western\r\ncountries; (iii) During recent years new drugs of addiction which have come to be known as\r\npsychotropic substances have appeared on the scene and posed serious problems to national\r\ngovernments. Therefore with a view to overcome the aforestated deficiencies the NDPS Act, 1985\r\ncame to be enacted. That thereafter to check the menace of dangerous drugs flooding the market,\r\nSection 37 of the Act came to be amended and it has been provided that the accused of an offence\r\nunder the Act shall not be released on bail during trial unless the mandatory conditions provided in\r\nSection 37 are satisfied.\r\nWhile considering the submission on behalf of the accused on mitigating and aggravating\r\ncircumstances and the request to take lenient view and not to impose the punishment higher than\r\nthe minimum sentence provided under the Act it should be borne in mind that in a murder case, the\r\naccused commits murder of one or two persons, while those persons who are dealing in narcotic\r\ndrugs are instruments in causing death or in inflicting death blow to number of innocent young\r\nvictims who are vulnerable; it cause deleterious effects and deadly impact on the society; they are\r\nhazard to the society. Organized activities of the underworld and the clandestine smuggling of\r\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into this country and illegal trafficking in such drugs\r\nand substances shall lay to drug addiction among a sizeable section of the public, particularly the\r\nadolescents and students of both sexes and the menace has assumed serious and alarming\r\nproportions in the recent years. Therefore, it has a deadly impact on the society as a whole.\r\nTherefore, while awarding the sentence\/punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society\r\nas a whole is also required to be taken in consideration. Therefore, while striking balance between\r\nthe mitigating and aggravating circumstances, public interest, impact on the society as a whole will\r\nalways be tilt in favour of the suitable higher punishment. Therefore, merely because the accused is\r\na poor man and\/or a carrier and\/or is a sole bread earner cannot be such mitigating circumstances\r\nin favour of the accused while awarding the sentence\/punishment in the case of NDPS Act. Even\r\notherwise, in the present case, the Special Court, as observed hereinabove has taken into\r\nconsideration the submission on behalf of the accused that he is a poor person; that he is sole bread\r\nearner, that it is his first offence, while not imposing the maximum punishment of 20 years R.I and\r\nimposing the punishment of 15 years R.I. only.\r\n8. In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, there is no substance in the present\r\nappeal and the same deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

A promissory\r\nnote was also executed by the original defendants while taking a further sum of\r\nRs.50,000\/- on 13.12.1992 and created a further charge in the mortgaged property.\r\nThat, as the defendants-mortgagers did not pay the aforesaid amount, the plaintiff filed a suit being\r\nO.S. No. 3376 of 1995 on 30.5.1995 before the Court of learned City Civil Judge at Bangalore for a\r\nsum of Rs.2,50,000\/- together with interest thereon. It was also further prayed that on failure of the\r\ndefendants to pay the decretal amount, the plaintiff shall be at liberty to sell the mortgaged property\r\nand the sale considerations so realized to be adjusted over the decretal amount. According to the\r\nplaintiff, the defendants filed a written statement on 31.05.1995 and admitted borrowing of\r\nRs.1,50,000\/-. According to the plaintiff, the defendants were represented by an Advocate. A\r\nCompromise\/Settlement was entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants on 01.06.1995.\r\nThe defendants agreed to pay to the plaintiff a sum of Rs.2,50,000\/- in a monthly installment of\r\nRs.5,000\/- within three years. Learned Trial Court accordingly decreed the suit in terms of the\r\ncompromise vide judgment and decree dated 01.06.1995. That the plaintiff filed an execution\r\npetition being Execution Petition No. 232 of 1996 before the Court of City Civil Judge, Bangalore on\r\n28.02.1996. The judgment debtor-defendant entered appearance through an advocate on\r\n21.06.1996 in the execution petition. That the judgment debtor- defendant filed objections in the\r\nexecution petition and contended that the decree dated 01.06.1995 was obtained by fraud. By order\r\ndated 03.03.1998, the Executing Court overruled the objections of the judgment debtor-defendant\r\nand specifically observed that the objections of the judgment debtor that the decree has been\r\nobtained by fraud, mis-representation etc., are overruled. By overruling the objections raised by the\r\njudgment debtor, learned Executing Court specifically observed that the judgment debtor has failed\r\nto lead any evidence in support of his objections that the decree was obtained by fraud or\r\nmis-representation. That, thereafter, learned Executing Court issued sale proclamation of the\r\nmortgaged property on 21.11.1998. The mortgaged property was put to sale by the Executing Court.\r\nThe appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1845 of 2010 was declared the highest bidder. He deposited 25%\r\nof the bid amount on 11.02.1999 itself on the day on which the sale was conducted. The auction\r\npurchaser offered Rs.4,50,000\/- and his bid was accepted by the Executing Court. After the bid of\r\nthe auction purchaser was accepted, the judgment debtors filed I.A. No. 03 of 1999 on 19.02.1999 in\r\nthe Execution Petition under Section 151 C.P.C. before the learned Additional City Civil Judge\r\n(Executing Court) to stay further proceedings with regard to sale of the subject mortgaged property.\r\nOn 22.02.1999, the judgment debtors filed another I.A. No. 04 of 1999 in the Execution Petition\r\nunder Order XXI read with Rule 90 and Order XXI read with Rule 47 and Section 151 CPC to set\r\naside the court auction\/sale dated 11.02.1999 and 18.02.1999 with respect to the subject mortgaged\r\nproperty. By order dated 30.10.1999 the learned Executing Court dismissed both the aforesaid\r\napplications. While dismissing I.A. No. 3 of 1999, the learned Executing Court observed that the\r\nearlier order dated 03.03.1998 was a speaking order and the objections raised by the judgment\r\ndebtors were overruled and the same had attained the finality as the same has not been assailed by\r\nthe judgment debtor before any competent Appellate Forum. Learned Executing Court also further\r\nobserved that the Executing Court cannot go behind the decree so as to decide the question of\r\ncorrectness and validity of the decree, when the decree has become final. The learned Executing\r\nCourt dismissed I.A. No. 04 of 1999 on the ground that the judgment debtors have not deposited the\r\ndecretal amount of Rs.4,50,000\/- together with interest in terms of Order XXI Rule 90 and\r\ntherefore it does not entitle them to any relief for setting aside the sale as per the requirement of\r\nOrder XXI Rule 90. That, thereafter, the sale of the mortgaged property came to be confirmed in\r\nfavour of the auction purchaser on 17.11.1999. Sale certificate was issued by the Court in favour of\r\nthe auction purchaser and the sale was registered with the Sub-Registrar on 23.11.1999. That the\r\njudgment debtors thereafter on 24.11.1999 filed Civil Revision Application No. 3699 of 1999 before\r\nthe High Court against the order dated 30.10.1999 passed by the learned Executing Court in I.A. No.\r\n4 of 1999 which was thereafter converted into MFA No. 3934 of 2000. The judgment debtors\r\nthereafter filed another Civil Revision Application No. 3700 of 1999 in the High Court against the\r\norder dated 30.10.1999 passed by the learned Executing Court in I.A. No. 3 of 1999. The High Court\r\nvide its order dated 06.01.2000 dismissed Civil Revision Application No. 3700 of 1999 by observing\r\nthat the issue regarding fraud has attained finality as the order dated 03.03.1998 passed by the\r\nlearned Executing Court overruling the objections of the judgment debtor had attainted finality and\r\nthe same remained unchallenged. Having realized that the judgment debtors were required to\r\nchallenge the order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections, thereafter, after a period of two\r\nyears from date of the order dated 03.03.1998, the judgment debtors filed Civil Revision Application\r\nNo. 3297 of 2000 before the High Court. Thereafter and having realized that non-challenging of the\r\njudgment and decree dated 01.06.1995 passed by the learned Trial Court in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995\r\nshall come in their way, after a period of five years from the date of passing the judgment and decree\r\ndated 01.06.1995, the judgment debtors filed an appeal being RFA no. 274 of 2001 in the High\r\nCourt. The said appeal was preferred in the year 2001. It is the case on behalf of the plaintiff that\r\nbefore the High Court a Compromise Petition was prepared on 10.06.2004 wherein the judgment\r\ndebtors agreed to pay Rs.6,96,062\/- in full and final settlement of the decree passed by the learned\r\nTrial Court. However, at the time of filing of the Compromise Petition, the judgment debtors\r\nwithdrew from the compromise agreed by them. Thereafter, the aforesaid first appeal proceeded\r\nfurther. The High Court vide order dated 19.09.2005 called for a finding\/report from the Principal\r\nCity Civil Judge and directed him to hold an enquiry as to whether the decree passed in O.S. No\r\n3376 of 1995 was obtained by fraud. The propriety and legality of the said order of calling for a\r\nreport\/finding from the learned Principal City Civil Judge shall be dealt with hereinafter at an\r\nappropriate stage. That the learned Principal City Civil Judge submitted the report dated\r\n06.12.2005 before the High Court wherein he recorded the finding that the decree in O.S. No. 3376\r\nof 1995 had been obtained by fraud. Relying upon the report submitted by the Principal City Civil\r\nJudge dated 06.12.2005 and having opined that the decree in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 was obtained by\r\nfraud, the High Court vide its impugned judgment and order dated 16.09.2006 has allowed the\r\nappeals being RFA No. 274 of 2001, MFA No. 3934 of 2000 and CRP No. 3297 of 2000 and the\r\noperative part of the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court is as under:\r\n\u201CRFA No. 274\/2001 is allowed with cost. The order and decree passed by the Court of\r\nXV Addl. City Civil Judge, Bangalore in O.S. No. 3376\/1995 dated 1.6.1995 is set\r\naside and suit is remitted to the Addl. City Civil Judge, Bangalore, for fresh disposal,\r\nin accordance with law. Defendants are permitted to file written statement within\r\nsixty days from today before the trial court.\r\nMFA No. 3394 \/2000 is allowed. Order dated 30.10.1999 is set aside. However, it is\r\nopen to the auction purchaser to make an application before the trial court for refund\r\nof the amount deposited by him and reimbursement of the amount spent by him for\r\nregistration of the sale deed and other expenses incurred by him and trial court shall\r\nconsider the said application and dispose of the same, in accordance with law.\r\n CRP No.3297\/2000 is allowed. Order dated 3.3.98\r\n is set aside.\u201D\r\n2.2 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and\r\norder passed by the High Court in allowing the appeals and quashing and setting\r\naside the judgment and decree dated 01.06.1995 passed in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995;\r\nquashing and setting aside the order dated 30.10.1999 passed by the learned\r\nExecuting Court and quashing and setting aside the order dated 03.03.1998 passed\r\nby the learned Executing Court in overruling the objection raised by the judgment\r\ndebtors, the original defendants as well as the successful auction purchaser have\r\npreferred the present appeals.\r\n3. Shri Rahul Arya, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\r\nvehemently submitted that the High Court has committed an error in quashing and\r\nsetting aside the consent decree and also in quashing and setting aside the orders\r\ndated 01.06.1995 and 30.10.1999. It is vehemently submitted that the High Court has\r\nmaterially erred in relying upon the report submitted by the learned Principal City\r\nCivil Judge that the decree in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 has been obtained by fraud. It is\r\nvehemently submitted that as such even the defendants admitted in the proceedings\r\nbefore the Principal City Civil Judge that he had mortgaged the property for\r\nRs.1,00,000\/- under the registered mortgage deed and that he took a further sum of\r\nRs.50,000\/- from Shantilal by executing a pro-note in his favour. It is submitted that he also admitted that the amount was not repaid. It is submitted that in fact and as\r\nan after-thought, the defendant came up with a case that he repaid the money.\r\nHowever, even as observed by the learned Principal City Civil Judge, he could not\r\nprove the payment.\r\nIt is submitted that the conduct on the part of the defendant that he has come up with a case that the\r\nconsent decree in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 was obtained by fraud is dishonest attempt to get out of the\r\nconsent decree.\r\n3.1 It is submitted that in fact the original defendant No. 1 had put his signature on the\r\nVakalatnama, written statement and the compromise deed. It is submitted therefore that it is not a\r\ncase of forged signature. It is further submitted that calling the report from the Principal City Civil\r\nJudge and directing him to hold an enquiry as to whether the decree was obtained by fraud itself\r\nwas contrary to the provisions of the CPC and such a procedure is unknown to law. It is submitted\r\nthat as such by referring the matter to the learned Principal City Civil Judge, the High Court gave\r\nample opportunity to the defendants to fill in the lacuna. It is submitted that as such the learned\r\nExecuting Court by passing the order dated 03.03.1998 specifically observed that the judgment\r\ndebtors have failed to prove by leading cogent evidence that the decree was obtained by fraud. It is\r\nsubmitted that as such after two years of the order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections\r\nraised by the judgment debtors, a revision was filed belatedly and as an after- thought.\r\n3.2 It is submitted that as such the first appeal itself before the High Court against the consent\r\ndecree was not maintainable in view of the provisions of Section 96 read with Order XXIII of the\r\nCPC. It is submitted that the High Court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact that\r\nagainst the consent decree, the appeal shall not be maintainable. It is submitted that the High Court\r\nhas materially erred in holding that the appeal would be maintainable. 3.3 It is further submitted\r\nthat the High Court has failed to appreciate that the judgment debtors \u2013 original defendants\r\nchallenged the consent decree dated 01.06.1995 only in the year 2001. It is submitted that in\r\nbetween number of proceedings were initiated before the Executing Court and the orders were\r\npassed by the Executing Court dated 03.03.1998, 30.10.1999 and even the mortgaged property was\r\nauctioned and the sale certificate was issued in favour of the auction purchaser in the month of\r\nNovember 1999 itself and the judgment debtors-original defendants did not challenge the consent\r\ndecree on the ground that it was obtained by fraud till 2001. It is submitted therefore that the\r\nconduct of the respondents suffers from delay and laches.\r\n3.4 It is further submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that pursuant to the\r\ncompromise decree, execution proceedings were filed, sale notice had been issued, immovable\r\nproperty was sold, sale came to be confirmed in favour of the auction purchaser and the auction\r\npurchaser paid the sale consideration in the court and even thereafter the sale certificate was issued\r\nand registered before the Sub-Registrar in the year 1999 itself.\r\n3.5 It is further submitted by the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the judgment debtors failed to deposit the amount of sale consideration before the Executing Court,\r\nwhich was required to be deposited under Order XXI Rule 90 of the CPC. It is submitted that therefore the High Court has materially erred in quashing and setting aside not only the consent\r\ndecree, but also the orders dated 01.06.1995 and 30.10.1999. 3.6 It is submitted that the learned\r\nPrincipal City Civil Judge erred in believing the plea of the judgment debtors-original defendants\r\nthat as the compromise process and the written statement were in English and he was knowing only\r\nthe vernacular language, he did not know what was there in the written statement and the consent\r\ncompromise deed. It is submitted that the original defendants have signed the mortgage deed which\r\nwas in English and was also signed by them on each and every page, it cannot be construed that the\r\ndefendants were familiar only with the vernacular language.\r\n4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the auction purchaser- appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1845\r\nof 2010 has further submitted that the appeal itself before the High Court challenging the consent\r\ndecree was not maintainable at all in view of the bar contained in Order XXIII Rule 3 and Section\r\n96(3) CPC. In support of the above submission, he has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court\r\nin Pushpa Devi Bhagat v. Rajinder Singh (2006) 5 SCC 566. 4.1 It is further submitted by the\r\nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of the auction purchaser that as such the auction purchaser\r\npurchased the property in the execution proceedings after he was declared the highest bidder. It is\r\nsubmitted that in the year 1999 itself the auction purchaser deposited the entire amount of sale\r\nconsideration before the Executing Court and even a sale certificate was also issued in favour of the\r\nauction purchaser. It is further submitted that therefore in view of the Order XXI Rule 92 read with\r\nRule 94 once the sale has become absolute and as held by this Court in the case of Chinnammal v. P.\r\nArumugham(1990) 1 SCC 513, subsequent reversal of the decree shall not affect the auction\r\npurchaser who is not a party to the decree. It is submitted that as held by this Court in the aforesaid\r\ndecision, the property bona fidely purchased ignorant of litigation should be protected. It is\r\nsubmitted that despite the fact that in the year 1999 the auction purchaser deposited the entire\r\namount, because of the subsequent initiation of proceedings by the judgment debtors, the auction\r\npurchaser is not in a position to enjoy the property which the auction purchaser has purchased on\r\npayment of full sale consideration purchased in an auction in the execution proceedings.\r\n4.2 It is further submitted that the High Court has failed to consider the conduct on the part of the\r\njudgment debtors-original defendants. It is submitted that even before the High Court a\r\ncompromise petition was prepared wherein the judgment debtors- original defendants agreed to pay\r\nRs.6,96,062\/- in full and final settlement of the decree passed by the learned Trial Court, however,\r\nat the time of the compromise petition, the respondents withdrew from the compromise agreed by\r\nthem. It is submitted that before the learned Principal City Civil Judge, the judgment debtororiginal defendant admitted the said compromise petition and admitted that he put his signature on\r\nthe compromise petition voluntarily and with free consent. It is submitted that therefore all\r\nthrough-out the conduct on the part of the defendants as original debtor is dis- honest and to delay\r\nthe proceedings and deprive the auction purchaser from using the property purchased in the year\r\n1999.\r\n5. Shri P.R. Ramasesh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendants-judgment\r\ndebtors has supported the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. 5.1 It is\r\nvehemently submitted that the learned Principal City Civil Judge in its report, which was called for\r\nby the High Court, has specifically observed that the consent decree was obtained by fraud. It is submitted that therefore relying upon the report\/finding by the learned Principal City Civil Judge\r\nand when the High Court has also come to the conclusion that the consent decree was obtained by\r\nfraud, the High Court has rightly set aside the consent decree and has rightly quashed and set aside\r\nthe judgment and decree dated 01.06.1995 and order dated 30.10.1999 passed by the Executing\r\nCourt and has rightly remanded the matter to the learned trial court to decide the suit on merits.\r\n5.2 It is submitted that the High Court has rightly held that the first appeal against the consent\r\ndecree would be maintainable. 5.3 It is submitted that the findings recorded by the learned Principal\r\nCity Civil Judge that the consent decree obtained by fraud is on re-appreciation of evidence. It is\r\nsubmitted that the High Court rightly directed the Trial Court to hold an enquiry whether the decree\r\nwas obtained by fraud, mis-representation. It is submitted that once it is observed and held that the\r\nconsent decree was obtained by fraud, mis-representation right from the beginning and even prior\r\nto the filing of the suit, such consent decree is not a decree in the eye of law and therefore the High\r\nCourt has rightly set aside the consent decree and remanded the matter to the Trial Court to decide\r\nthe suit on merits. It is submitted that therefore all other subsequent orders passed in the executing\r\nproceedings would be nullity and therefore the same are rightly set aside by the High Court.\r\n5.4 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeals.\r\n6. Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties at length.\r\n6.1 At the outset, it is required to be noted that by the impugned common judgment and order, the\r\nHigh Court has allowed the first appeal preferred by the original defendants and has quashed and\r\nset aside the consent decree passed by the learned Trial Court in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 dated\r\n01.06.1995, much after the mortgaged property came to be sold in the execution proceedings and\r\nmuch after the sale in favour of the auction purchaser was confirmed and the sale certificate was\r\nalso issued. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has also set aside the order dated\r\n30.10.1999 passed by the learned Executing Court in I.A. No. 4 of 1999, by which the learned\r\nExecuting Court dismissed the application preferred by the judgment debtors under Order XXI Rule\r\n90 read Section 47 C.P.C. praying for setting aside the Court auction sale. By the impugned\r\njudgment and order, the High Court has also allowed the Revision Application being CRP No. 3297\r\nof 2000 and has also quashed and set aside the order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections\r\nraised by the judgment debtors, more particularly, overruling the objection raised by the judgment\r\ndebtors that the consent decree was obtained by fraud. As observed hereinabove, both the judgment\r\ncreditor-original plaintiff and the auction purchaser in whose favour the sale deed was confirmed\r\nand the sale certificate was issued in his favour as far back as on 17.11.1999\/23.11.1999, have\r\npreferred the present appeals.\r\n7. Therefore, the short question which is posed for consideration of this Court in the present appeals\r\nis whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, more particularly, when the mortgaged\r\nproperty was sold in the court auction in the execution proceedings and the sale was confirmed in\r\nfavour of the auction purchaser and the sale certificate was issued and sale was confirmed after\r\noverruling the objections raised by the judgment debtors, more particularly, the objection that the\r\nconsent decree was obtained by fraud and that initially the consent decree was not challenged at all\r\nand not only that, even order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections raised by the judgment\r\ndebtors was also not challenged at the earliest, the High Court is justified in quashing and setting\r\naside the consent decree on the ground that the same was obtained by fraud, relying upon the report\r\nsubmitted by the Principal City Civil Judge which was called for in the appeal.\r\n8. While considering the above-said questions, as such, the conduct\/inaction on the part of the\r\njudgment debtors after the consent decree was passed are required to be considered, which are\r\nreferred to hereinabove and which are again reiterated as under:\r\n8.1 That the learned Trial Court passed the consent decree on 01.06.1995 and decreed\r\nthat the defendants shall pay to the plaintiff a sum of Rs.2,50,000\/- in a monthly\r\ninstallment of Rs.5,000\/- within three years from that day. At the outset, it is\r\nrequired to be noted that the execution of the simple mortgage deed, execution of the\r\npromissory note and taking the amounts of loan, have not been disputed by the\r\njudgment debtors. That, after the consent decree was passed on 01.06.1995, the\r\njudgment creditor-original plaintiff filed an execution petition before the Additional\r\nCity Civil Judge, Bangalore, being Execution Petition No. 232 of 1996 on 28.02.1996.\r\nThe judgment debtors entered appearance through an Advocate in the execution\r\npetition on 21.06.1996. Therefore, at least, it can be said that the judgment debtors\r\nwere aware of the consent decree at least on 21.06.1996.\r\nInstead of challenging the said consent decree on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, the\r\njudgment debtors filed their objections in the execution petition contending that it was obtained by\r\nfraud. Such objections were filed on 04.10.1996. Learned Executing Court by a reasoned order dated\r\n03.03.1998 overruled the objections of the judgment debtors that the decree has been obtained by\r\nfraud, mis-representation etc., by specifically observing that after filing of the objections, the matter\r\nwas being posted for hearing, but the judgment debtors did not either adduce any evidence in that\r\nbehalf nor have they addressed any arguments also and, therefore, in the absence of any proof of the\r\nallegation of fraud etc. made by the judgment debtors, the objections have to be overruled. That the\r\njudgment debtors did not challenge the order dated 03.03.1998 before the higher forum. Thereafter,\r\nafter a period of eight months from the passing of the order dated 03.03.1998, the learned Executing\r\nCourt issued the sale proclamation of the mortgaged property on 21.11.1998. The spot sale was held\r\non 11.02.1999. The auction purchaser-appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1845 of 2010 was declared as the\r\nhighest bidder. He deposited 25% of the bid amount. After his bid was accepted being the highest\r\nbidder, the Executing Court confirmed the sale\/bid on 18.02.1999. Thereafter, judgment debtors\r\nfiled I.A. No. 03 of 1999 before the Executing Court for stay of further proceedings in respect of sale\r\nof the subject mortgaged property. Judgment debtors also filed I.A. No. 4 of 1999 under Order XXI\r\nRule 90 read with Rule 47 CPC before the Executing Court for setting aside Court sale in respect of\r\nthe subject mortgaged property. The learned Executing Court dismissed both the aforesaid\r\napplications. Learned Executing Court dismissed I.A. No. 3 of 1999 by observing that the order\r\ndated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections filed by the judgment debtors has attained the finality as\r\nthe same has not been assailed before any appellate forum and that the Executing Court cannot go\r\nbehind the decree so as to decide the question of correctness and validity of the decree, when the\r\ndecree had become final. The learned Executing Court dismissed I.A. No. 4 of 1999 on the ground that the judgment debtors have not deposited the decretal amount of Rs.4,50,000\/- together with\r\ninterest in terms of Order XXI Rule 90 and therefore the judgment debtors are not entitled to seek\r\nfor setting aside of the sale as per the requirement of Order XXI Rule 90. That, thereafter the\r\nlearned Executing Court confirmed the sale in favour of the auction purchaser on 17.11.1999. On\r\n23.11.1999, the sale certificate was issued by the court in favour of the auction purchaser and the sale\r\nwas registered with the Sub-Registrar. That, after the sale was confirmed and the sale certificate was\r\nissued in favour of the auction purchaser and after the sale was registered with the Sub-Registrar,\r\nthe judgment debtors filed Civil Revision Petition No. 3699 of 1999 in the High Court of Karnataka\r\nagainst the order dismissing I.A. No. 4 of 1999, which was thereafter converted into MFA No. 3934\r\nof 2000. Thereafter the judgment debtors also filed Civil Revision Petition No. 3700 of 1999 in the\r\nHigh Court of Karnataka at Bangalore against the order dated 30.10.1999 passed by the Executing\r\nCourt. Civil Revision Petition No. 3700 of 1999 came to be dismissed by the High Court by an order\r\ndated 06.01.2000 holding that the issue that the decree was obtained by fraud has attained finality\r\nin view of order dated 03.03.1998 rejecting the objections of the judgment debtors remained\r\nunchallenged. That, thereafter, after the lapse of around two years, the judgment debtors challenged\r\nthe order dated 03.03.1998 by filing CRP No. 3297 of 2000. At this stage, it is required to be noted\r\nthat till this time judgment debtors did not challenge the decree dated 01.06.1995 before the High\r\nCourt. That, after a period of five years from the date of passing of the judgment and decree dated\r\n01.06.1995 the judgment debtors preferred RFA No. 274 of 2001 challenging the decree dated\r\n01.06.1995 passed by the learned Trial Court on the ground that the same has been obtained by\r\nfraud and mis-representation. After a period of five years from the date of filing of the appeal, the\r\nHigh Court called for a finding\/report from the learned Principal City Civil Judge and directed him\r\nto hold an enquiry as to whether the decree dated 01.06.1995 was obtained by fraud. The legality\r\nand propriety of the said order shall be dealt with hereinbelow at an appropriate stage. Before the\r\nlearned Principal City Civil Judge, the judgment debtors led the evidence in support of their claim\r\nthat the judgment and decree was obtained by fraud and mis-representation, which evidence was\r\nnot led by them before the Executing Court when they submitted the objections and contended that\r\nthe decree was obtained by fraud. That, thereafter, the learned Principal City Civil Judge submitted\r\nthe report that the decree was obtained by fraud and on the basis of the report submitted by learned\r\nPrincipal City Civil Judge mainly, the High Court has set aside the judgment and decree by the\r\nimpugned judgment and order. Thus, from the aforesaid it is crystal clear that all through-out there\r\nwas a delay and negligence on the part of the judgment debtors in not initiating the appropriate\r\nproceedings at appropriate stage. Order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections submitted by\r\nthe judgment debtors to the effect that the judgment was obtained by fraud and mis-representation\r\nwas not challenged by the judgment debtors till the mortgaged property was auctioned; sale of the\r\nmortgaged property was confirmed in favour of the auction purchaser and even the sale certificate\r\nwas issued in favour of the auction purchaser and sale was registered with the Sub-Registrar and\r\neven also the dismissal of I.A. No. 3 of 1999 and I.A. No. 4 of 1999. Not only that, till that time even\r\nno appeal was assailed\/challenged before the higher forum. The first appeal was filed in the year\r\n2000 and by that time the mortgaged property was already sold in the execution proceedings and\r\nthe sale was confirmed in favour of the auction purchaser and even the sale certificate was issued in\r\nfavour of the auction purchaser.9. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil\r\nProcedure, more particularly, Order XXI Rule 92 read with Order XXI Rule 94, once the sale is\r\nconfirmed and the sale certificate has been issued in favour of the purchaser, the same shall become\r\nfinal.\r\n10. Now, so far as the procedure adopted by the High Court calling for the report from the learned\r\nPrincipal City Civil Judge on whether the decree was obtained by fraud or not is concerned, at the\r\noutset, it is required to be noted that at the time when the High Court passed such an order, there\r\nwas already an order passed by the learned Executing Court dated 03.03.1998 overruling the\r\nobjections raised by the judgment debtors that the decree was obtained by fraud and\r\nmis-representation. As observed by the learned Executing Court in the order dated 03.03.1998, the\r\njudgment debtors except the averments that the decree was obtained by fraud, mis-representation,\r\nneither any further submissions were made on that nor even the judgment debtors led any evidence\r\nin support of the same. Therefore, as such, learned Executing Court was justified in overruling the\r\nobjection that the decree was obtained by fraud, mis-representation etc. As per the settled principle\r\nof law, when the fraud is alleged the same is required to be pleaded and established by leading\r\nevidence. Mere allegation that there was a fraud is not sufficient. Therefore, subsequent order\r\npassed by the High Court calling for the report from the learned Principal City Civil Judge on the\r\nquestion whether the decree was obtained by fraud or not, can be said to be giving an opportunity to\r\nthe judgment debtors to fill in the lacuna. Therefore, the course adopted by the High Court calling\r\nfor the report from the learned Principal City Civil Judge cannot be approved. 10.1 Even otherwise,\r\nit is required to be noted that as per the provisions of Order XLI, the appellate court may permit\r\nadditional evidence to be produced whether oral or documentary, if the conditions mentioned in\r\nOrder XLI Rule 27 are satisfied after the additional evidence is permitted to be produced in exercise\r\nof powers under Order XLI Rule 27. Thereafter, the procedure under Order XLI Rules 28 and 29 is\r\nrequired to be followed. Therefore, unless and until the procedure under Order XLI Rules 27, 28 and\r\n29 are followed, the parties to the appeal cannot be permitted to lead additional evidence and\/or the\r\nappellate court is not justified to direct the court from whose decree the appeal is preferred or any\r\nother subordinate court, to take such evidence and to send it when taken to the Appellate Court.\r\nFrom the material produced on record, it appears that the said procedure has not been followed by\r\nthe High Court while calling for the report from the learned Principal City Civil Judge.\r\n10.2 Even otherwise, it is required to be noted that at the time when the learned Principal City Civil\r\nJudge permitted the parties to lead the evidence and submitted the report\/finding that the decree\r\nwas obtained by fraud, there was already an order passed by the Executing Court-Co-ordinate Court\r\noverruling the objections made by the judgment debtors that the decree was obtained by fraud.\r\nTherefore, unless and until the order dated 03.03.1998 was set aside, neither the High Court was\r\njustified in calling for the report from the learned Principal City Civil Judge nor even the learned\r\nPrincipal City Civil Judge was justified in permitting the judgment debtors to lead the evidence on\r\nthe allegation that the decree was obtained by fraud, mis-representation, when the judgment\r\ndebtors failed to lead any evidence earlier before the Executing Court when such objections were\r\nraised.\r\n11. From the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that the High\r\nCourt has heavily relied upon the report submitted by the learned Principal City Civil Judge and\r\nthereafter has come to the conclusion that the decree was obtained by fraud, mis-representation.\r\nTherefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated above, the High\r\nCourt has committed an error in relying upon the report submitted by the learned Principal City\r\nCivil Judge holding that the decree was obtained by fraud.\r\n11.1 Even otherwise, on perusal of the evidence led before the learned Principal City Civil Judge and\r\neven the findings recorded by the learned Principal City Civil Judge and the reasoning given by the\r\nHigh Court while holding that the decree was obtained by fraud, we are of the opinion that, in the\r\nfacts and circumstances of the case, and even on the evidence led, the High Court has erred in\r\nholding that the decree was obtained by fraud. The judgment debtors-original defendants have put\r\ntheir signatures on the written statement or on the consent terms. The mortgaged property and the\r\npromissory note are not in dispute. Therefore, when the suit was filed and the judgment debtors\r\nwanted to get more time to repay the amount and when it was agreed to pay Rs.4,50,000\/- (suit\r\nclaim) in a monthly installment of Rs.5,000\/- within three years, nothing was unnatural.\r\n12. Now, so far as the objection raised on behalf of the appellant herein that the appeal before the\r\nHigh Court against a consent decree was not maintainable is concerned, the same has no substance.\r\nThe High Court has elaborately dealt with the same in detail and has considered the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, namely, Section 96, Order XXIII Rule 3, Order XLIII Rule\r\n1 (m) and order XLIII Rule 1A(2). It is true that, as per Section 96(3), the appeal against the decree\r\npassed with the consent of the parties shall be barred. However, it is also true that as per Order\r\nXXIII Rule 3A no suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the\r\ndecree is based was not lawful. However, it is required to be noted that when Order XLIII Rule 1(m)\r\ncame to be omitted by Act 104 of 1976, simultaneously, Rule XLIII Rule 1A came to be inserted by\r\nthe very Act 104 of 1976, which provides that in an appeal against the decree passed in a suit for\r\nrecording a compromise or refusing to record a compromise, it shall be open to the appellant to\r\ncontest the decree on the ground that the compromise should or should not have been recorded.\r\nTherefore, the High Court has rightly relied upon the decision of this Court in Banwari Lal v.\r\nChando Devi AIR 1993 SC 1139 (para\r\n9) and has rightly come to the conclusion that the appeal before the High Court against the\r\njudgment and decree passed in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 was maintainable. No error has been\r\ncommitted by the High Court in holding so.\r\n13. Now, so far as the dismissal of I.A. No. 4 of 1999 by the learned Executing Court in the Execution\r\nPetition No. 232 of 1996 which was filed by the judgment debtors to set aside the court auction\/sale\r\ndated 11.02.1999 and 18.02.1999 with respect to the subject mortgaged property is concerned, it is\r\nnot in dispute that the judgment debtors as such did not deposit the amount of Rs.4,50,000\/- i.e.\r\nsale consideration together with interest in terms of Order XXI Rule 90 CPC. Where any immovable\r\nproperty has been sold in execution of a decree, the decree-holder, or the purchaser, or any other\r\nperson entitled to share in a rateable distribution of assets, or whose interests are affected by the\r\nsale, may apply to the Court to set aside the sale on the ground of a material irregularity or fraud in\r\npublishing or conducting it. Therefore, as per Order XXI Rule 90, an application to set aside the sale\r\non the ground of irregularity or fraud may be made by the decree holder on the ground of material\r\nirregularity or fraud in publishing or conducting it. It is required to be noted that in the present\r\ncase, as such, it is not the case of the judgment debtors that there was any material irregularity or\r\nfraud in publishing or conducting the sale. No such submissions have been made before this Court.\r\nTheir objection is that the decree was obtained by fraud. Therefore also, the application submitted\r\nby the original judgment debtors under Order XXI Rule 90 i.e. I.A. No. 4 of 1999 was required to be\r\ndismissed and was rightly dismissed by the learned Executing Court.\r\n14. Now, so far as the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court in CRP No. 3297 of\r\n2000 quashing and setting aside the order passed by the Executing Court dated 03.03.1998 is\r\nconcerned, from the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that the\r\nsale has been set aside by the High Court in view of the finding on Point No. 1 i.e. the decree was\r\nobtained by fraud and mis-representation and considering the report filed by the learned Principal\r\nCity Civil Judge. However, it is required to be noted that at the time when learned Executing Court\r\npassed the order dated 03.03.1998 no evidence was led by the judgment debtors. The allegation that\r\nthe decree was obtained by fraud and mis-representation was not substantiated. The High Court\r\nought to have appreciated that even the order dated 03.03.1998 was not challenged by the judgment\r\ndebtors till the year 2000 and, in the meantime, two applications being I.A. 3 of 1999 and I.A. No. 4\r\nof 1999 were submitted by the judgment debtors under Order XXI Rule 90, which came to be\r\ndismissed and the mortgaged property was sold in the court auction and even the sale was\r\nconfirmed and the sale certificate was issued and the same was registered with the Sub-Registrar. As\r\nobserved hereinabove, as per Order XXI Rule 92, where an application is made under Order XXI\r\nRule 89, Order XXI Rule 90 and Order XXI Rule 91 and the same is disallowed, the Court shall\r\nmake an order confirming the sale and thereafter the sale shall become absolute. As per Order XXI\r\nRule 94, where a sale of immovable property has become absolute, the Court shall grant a certificate\r\nspecifying the property sold and the name of the person who at the time of sale is declared to be the\r\npurchaser. Such certificate shall bear the date on which the sale became absolute. Therefore, when\r\nafter the order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections raised by the judgment debtors and\r\nthereafter the order was passed in I.A. No. 4 of 1999 and thereafter when the sale was confirmed and\r\nthe sale certificate was issued, the High Court ought not to have thereafter set aside the order dated\r\n03.03.1998 overruling the objections raised by the judgment debtors, which order was not\r\nchallenged by the judgment debtors before the High Court till the year 2000. Under the\r\ncircumstances, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court in CRP No. 3297 of\r\n2000 quashing and setting aside the order dated 03.03.1998 cannot be sustained and the same\r\ndeserves to be quashed and set aside.\r\n15. Now, so far as the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court in MFA No. 3934 of\r\n2000 quashing and setting aside the order dated 30.10.1999 dismissing I.A. No. 4 of 1999 which was\r\nfiled by the judgment debtors under Order XXI Rule 90 is concerned, the High Court has set aside\r\nthe same observing that the auction purchaser cannot be said to be the bona fide purchaser as he\r\nwas related to the judgment creditor and that he was a partner of the firm in whose favour the\r\nmortgage was executed. However, it is required to be noted that I.A. No. 4 of 1999 was not filed to\r\nset aside the sale on the aforesaid grounds. The said application was submitted on the ground thatno proper publication was made to get the adequate market value. Therefore, the High Court has\r\ngone beyond the case of the judgment debtors in I.A. No. 4 of 1999. Even on merits also and\r\nfactually, the High Court is not correct in observing that the auction purchaser was not a bona fide\r\npurchaser. According to the judgment creditor, the partnership firm was already dissolved much\r\nbefore and thereafter the plaintiff inherited the assets, claims and liabilities of the firm. Even as\r\nobserved by the learned Executing Court while passing the order in I.A. No. 4 of 1999 the judgment\r\ndebtors even did not deposit the entire amount. Under the circumstances, the High Court therefore\r\ncommitted an error in quashing and setting aside order dated 30.10.1999 passed in I.A. No. 4 of\r\n1999.\r\n16. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, both these appeals succeed. The impugned\r\ncommon judgment and order passed by the High Court in RFA No. 274 of 2001, MFA No. 3934 of\r\n2000 and CRP No. 3297 of 2000 is hereby quashed and set aside. However, there shall be no order\r\nas to costs.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

          "judgement":"Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J\r\n1. Leave granted.\r\n2. On 9 June 2018, the appellant lodged a report at Police Station Kishangarh, District Ajmer on the\r\nbasis of which FIR No.116\/2018 for offences punishable under Sections 302 and 201 of the Penal\r\nCode was registered. In his complaint, the appellant stated that on 8 June 2018, his younger brother\r\nRam Niwas had gone out for carrying out labour work. The appellant was informed by his mother\r\nthat evening that Ram Niwas was away to meet his brother-in\u2013law, Kishan Lal, and that he would\r\nnot return for the day. On 9 June 2018, Ram Niwas\u2019s spouse informed the appellant that her brother\r\nKishan Lal had taken Ram Niwas in a vehicle at about 3.00 o\u2019clock. The local residents informed the\r\nappellant that the dead body of Ram Niwas was thrown out of a vehicle at a specified place in the\r\narea of Police Station Kishangarh. Investigation commenced on the basis of the report lodged by the\r\nappellant. Since the deceased belonged to a Scheduled Caste, offences punishable under the\r\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 19891 were added. The\r\nfirst respondent was arrested. On 6 September 2018, a final report under Section 173 of the Code of\r\nCriminal Procedure2 was submitted by the Investigating Officer against Kishan Lal and three otheraccused of which the first respondent was named as A-4.\r\n3. Aggrieved by the rejection of his application for bail by the Sessions Court, the first respondent\r\nmoved the High Court of Rajasthan seeking enlargement on bail 3. The complainant was\r\nrepresented by counsel, notice having been given to him under sub-sections (3) and (5) of 15A of the\r\nSC\/ST Act. The appeal was withdrawn on 8 August 2019.\r\n4. On 25 September 2019, the first respondent instituted an application 4 before the Special Judge,\r\nSC\/ST (Atrocities Prevention Cases) Ajmer for the grant of bail. The application for bail was rejected\r\nby the Special Judge by an order dated 25 September 2019. The Special Judge noted that the\r\nstatements of five witnesses \u2013 \u201CSC\/ST Act\u201D \u201CCrPC\u201D S.B. Criminal Appeal No.1132\/2019 Criminal\r\nMiscellaneous Case No.1253\/2019 PW.1 Suresh, PW.2 Smt. Aaram Devi, PW.3 Hari Ram, PW.4\r\nRamshankar and PW.5 Gokul Singh were recorded, but certain crucial witnesses were yet to be\r\nexamined. Consequently, the second bail application submitted by the first respondent was rejected.\r\nThe first respondent instituted an appeal5 before the High Court against the rejection of a second\r\napplication for bail. No notice was issued to the appellant under the provisions of Section 15A of the\r\nSC\/ST Act.\r\n5. On 7 November 2019, the High Court heard arguments in the appellate proceedings 6 when it was\r\nsubmitted by counsel for the first respondent that PW.2, the wife of the deceased, had stated that\r\nthe deceased had accompanied his brother-in-law (co-accused Kishan Lal), who had taken an\r\ninsurance policy in the name of the deceased and that it was Kishan Lal who had committed the\r\nmurder with the help of his friends to obtain the proceeds of the insurance policy. After recording\r\nthe above submission of the first respondent, the High Court enlarged the first respondent on bail by\r\nits order dated 7 November 2019. The order of the High Court reads thus:\r\n\u201C1. The present criminal appeal under Section 14(A)(2) of the SC\/ST (Prevention of\r\nAtrocities) Act has been filed in connection with FIR No.116\/2018 registered at Police\r\nStation Kishangarh District Ajmer for the offences under Sections 302 & 201 of IPC\r\nand 3(2)(v) of SC\/ST Act.\r\n2. Counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant has been falsely implicated in\r\nthis matter. Counsel further submits that the wife of the deceased Smt. Aaram Devi\r\n(PW2) in her statement recorded during trial has stated that the deceased went with her brother\r\nco-accused Kishan Lal who he has taken insurance policy in the name of her husband S.B. Criminal\r\nAppeal No.2518\/2019 S.B. Criminal Appeal No.2518\/2019 and he also purchased the trailer on\r\nbeing financed in the name of her husband and for taking amount of insurance policy Kishan Lal\r\ncommitted murder of her husband with the help of his friends. Counsel further submits that no\r\nallegation has been levelled by her in the statement against the appellant and the appellant is behind\r\nthe bars since 11.06.2018.\r\n3. Learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the appeal.\r\n4. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, it would be just and expedient to order\r\nthe release of the appellant on bail.\r\n5. The order dated 25.09.2019 passed by the learned Special Judge, SC\/ST (Prevention of Atrocities\r\nCases), Ajmer is quashed and set-aside and this appeal is accordingly allowed and it is directed that\r\naccused appellant Satyanarayan s\/o Shri Sohandas shall be released on bail provided he furnishes a\r\npersonal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000\/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) together with two sureties\r\nin the sum of Rs.25,000\/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand Only) each to the satisfaction of the\r\nlearned Trial Court with the stipulation that he shall appear before that Court and any Court to\r\nwhich the matter is transferred, on all subsequent dates of hearing and as and when called upon to\r\ndo so.\u201D\r\n6. The appellant moved the High Court under Section 439(2) of CrPC for cancellation of bail. 7 In\r\nthe meantime, another Single Judge of the High Court, by an order dated 29 January 2021 rejected\r\nthe application for bail filed by three co- accused - Kalu Ram, Kishan Lal and Chaman Lal. The\r\napplication for cancellation of bail before the High Court was moved principally on the ground that\r\nno notice was issued to the appellant under sub-section (3) of Section 15A of the SC\/ST Act,\r\nresultingly no opportunity to be heard was provided under sub-section (5) of Section 15A. The Single\r\nJudge who had admitted the first respondent to bail on 7 S.B. Criminal Bail Cancellation Application\r\nNo.21\/2020 November 2019 rejected the application on the ground that since the appellant was\r\nbeing heard in the application for cancelling bail, the requirements of sub-sections (3) and (5) of\r\nSection 15A were complied with. The High Court observed:\r\n\u201CSo far as compliance of Section 15A (3)(5) of SC\/ST is concerned, this Court today\r\nheard counsel for the complainant-petitioner again on merits, therefore, requirement\r\nof issuing notice to the complainant-petitioner (victim) as provided under Section\r\n15A (3)(5) of the SC\/ST Act is being complied with.\r\nThe order dated 07.11.2019 was passed by this Court after considering the statement\r\nof PW-2, Smt. Aaram Devi, wife of the deceased, therefore, I see no reason for\r\nrecalling of the order dated 07.11.2019. As such, this criminal miscellaneous bail\r\ncancellation application is hereby dismissed.\u201D\r\n7. We have heard Mr Ajit Kumar Thakur, learned counsel in support of the appeal. Mr Manish\r\nSharma, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of the first respondent while Mr Chetanya Singh,\r\nlearned counsel has appeared on behalf of the State of Rajasthan. On behalf of the appellant, it has\r\nbeen submitted that:\r\n(i) There has been a fundamental infraction of the provisions of Section 15A of the\r\nSC\/ST Act by the High Court in not issuing notice to the appellant, who in his\r\ncapacity as a complainant, was entitled to be heard in any proceeding under the Act,\r\ninter alia, in respect of bail;(ii) As a matter of fact, in the appeal which had been filed before the High Court\r\nagainst the rejection of the first bail application by the Special Judge, the appellant\r\nwas represented by counsel and that by an order dated 8 August 2019, the appeal was\r\ndismissed as not pressed;\r\n(iii) The failure to issue a notice to the appellant under sub-sections (3) and (5) of\r\nSection 15A before the grant of bail by the High Court cannot be obviated\r\nsubsequently by observing that the appellant was being heard on the application for\r\ncancellation of bail;\r\n(iv) In the order dated 7 November 2019 the Single Judge merely recorded the\r\nstatement of counsel for the accused that the spouse of the deceased had in the\r\ncourse of her statement alleged that the deceased had gone with her brother who had\r\nobtained an insurance policy in the name of the deceased and it was Kishan Lal, the\r\nbrother-in-law of the deceased, who had committed the murder with the help of his\r\nfriends;\r\n(v) The final report which has been submitted after investigation on 6 September\r\n2018 prima facie reveals the complicity of the first respondent in the murder of the\r\ndeceased. The investigation has revealed that the first respondent together with two\r\nof the co-accused participated in the murder and there is a CCTV camera footage; and\r\n(vi) Besides the statements of the spouse and the mother of the deceased and of an\r\nindependent witness under Section 161 CrPC, the call data records of the accused\r\nhave been obtained for the period between 1 June 2018 and 11 June 2018. The call\r\ndata records indicate that all the accused were in close contact with each other during\r\nthe said period and proximate to the time of the offence. The call data records also\r\nindicate the location of the accused at the time of the murder.\r\n8. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent submitted\r\nthat:\r\n(i) The order granting bail has relied upon the statement of the spouse of the\r\ndeceased that Ram Niwas was murdered by his brother-in-law Kishan Lal with the\r\nhelp of his friends for obtaining the proceeds of the insurance policy which was\r\nobtained in the name of the deceased and hence the main and substantive allegation\r\nis against Kishan Lal;\r\n(ii) In the event that this Court comes to the conclusion that the appellant ought to\r\nhave been heard before the grant of bail, the court may consider remanding the\r\nproceedings back to the High Court; and\r\n(iii) Since his release on 7 November 2019 the first respondent has not committed\r\nany act which would have a detrimental bearing on his liberty.\r\n9. A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the State of Rajasthan by the Additional S.P., Rural\r\nDistrict, Ajmer. The affidavit states that during the course of the investigation it has been revealed\r\nthat Kishan Lal, the brother-in-law of Ram Niwas, helped the latter board the vehicle from Vijay\r\nNagar to Bander Sinderi. After some time, the local residents of Bander Sinderi saw the body of Ram\r\nNiwas being thrown out of the vehicle in front of Gokul Singh Dhaba situated in the Kishangarh\r\narea. Statements of witnesses were recorded under Section 161 CrPC. During the course of the\r\ninvestigation, the provisions of Section 3(2)(v) of the SC\/ST Act were added; the accused belongs to\r\nthe Swarn community while the deceased belonged to a Scheduled Caste. According to the affidavit,\r\nthe Safi with which the deceased was killed in the vehicle was recovered at the behest of the accused,\r\nincluding the first respondent. Moreover, it has been submitted that the analysis of the call data\r\nrecords indicates that on 9 June 2018 continuous conversations were found between the accused at\r\nthe location near Bandanwada at about 1.00 pm and that thereafter the location of all the accused\r\nincluding the first respondent was found at the same place. It has been submitted in the affidavit\r\nthat the first respondent is a habitual offender; he was previously charged for an offence under\r\nSections 498A and 406 IPC in Case No.75\/2008 in the Court of ACJM-01, Kekari District Court in\r\nwhich he has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for one year.\r\n10. The SC\/ST Act has been enacted by the Parliament to effectuate a salutary public purpose of\r\nachieving the fulfillment of constitutional rights of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The\r\nStatement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the introduction of the Bill in 1989 contains the\r\nfollowing elucidation:\r\n\u201C1. Despite various measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of the\r\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, they remain vulnerable. They are denied\r\nnumber of civil rights. They are subjected to various offences, indignities,\r\nhumiliations and harassment. They have, in several brutal incidents, been deprived\r\nof their life and property. Serious crimes are committed against them for various\r\nhistorical, social and economic reasons.\r\n2. Because of the awareness created amongst the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\r\nTribes through spread of education, etc., they are trying to assert their rights and this\r\nis not being taken very kindly by the others. When they assert their rights and resist\r\npractices of un-touchability against them or demand statutory minimum wages or\r\nrefuse to do any bonded and forced labour, the vested interests try to cow them down\r\nand terrorise them. When the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes try to\r\npreserve their self-respect or honour of their women, they become irritants for the\r\ndominant and the mighty. Occupation and cultivation of even the government\r\nallotted land by the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes is resented and' more\r\noften these people become victims of attacks by the vested interests of late, there has\r\nbeen an increase in the disturbing trend of commission of certain atrocities like\r\nmaking the Scheduled Castes persons eat inedible substances like human excreta and\r\nattacks on and mass killings of helpless Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and\r\nrape of women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Under\r\nthe circumstances, the existing laws like the protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 andthe normal provisions of the Indian Penal Code have been found to be inadequate to\r\ncheck these crimes. A special legislation to check and deter crimes against them\r\ncommitted by non-Scheduled Castes and nonScheduled Tribes has, therefore, become necessary.\r\n3. The term 'atrocity' has not been defined so far. It is considered necessary that not only the term\r\n'atrocity' should be defined but stringent measures should be introduced to provide for higher\r\npunishments for committing such atrocities. It is also proposed to enjoining, on the States and the\r\nUnion territories to take specific preventive and punitive measures to protect the Scheduled Castes\r\nand the Scheduled Tribes from being victimised and where atrocities are committed, to provide\r\nadequate relief and assistance to rehabilitate them.\r\n4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.\u201D\r\n11. Section 15A, which comes under Chapter IV-A of the SC\/ST Act titled \u2018Rights of victims and\r\nwitnesses\u2019, was introduced by way of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of\r\nAtrocities) Amendment Act, 2015, which came into effect on 26 January 2016. The Statement of\r\nObjects and Reasons that accompanied the insertion of Chapter IV-A reads as follows:\r\n\u201C(h) to insert a new Chapter IVA relating to \u201CRights of Victims and Witnesses\u201D to\r\nimpose certain duties and responsibilities upon the State for making necessary\r\narrangements for protection of victims, their dependents and witnesses against any\r\nkind of intimidation, coercion or inducement or violence or threats of\r\nviolence\u201D(emphasis supplied).\u201D\r\n12. Investigations in India are the exclusive domain of the police, where victims are often relegated\r\nto the role of being a spectator in the criminal justice system. Victims of crime often face significant\r\nhurdles during investigation and prosecution. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes specifically\r\nsuffer on account of procedural lapses in the criminal justice system. They face insurmountable\r\nhurdles in accessing justice from the stage of filing the complaint to the conclusion of the trial. Due\r\nto the fear of retribution from members of upper caste groups, ignorance or police apathy, many\r\nvictims do not register complaints in the first place. If victims or their relatives muster up the\r\ncourage to approach the police, the police officials are reluctant to register complaints or do not\r\nrecord allegations accurately. Eventually, if the case does get registered, the victims and witnesses\r\nare vulnerable to intimidation, violence and social and economic boycott. 8 Further, many\r\nperpetrators of caste- based atrocities get away scot-free due to shoddy investigations and the\r\nnegligence of prosecuting advocates. 9 This results in low conviction rates under the SC\/ST Act\r\ngiving rise to the erroneous perception that cases registered under the Act are false C Prabhu,\r\nProtecting the Rights of Victims and Witnesses in Caste-Based Atrocities, Centre for Law and Policy\r\nResearch Blog, available at\r\nhttps:\/\/clpr.org.in\/blog\/protecting-the-rights-of-victims-witnesses-in-caste-based-atrocities\/ (15\r\nSeptember 2020), last accessed on 27 October 2021. Subhradipta Sarkar, The Quest for Victims\u2019\r\nJustice in India, Human Rights Brief 17(2) (2010), p.16-20. and that it is being misused. On thecontrary, the reality is that many acquittals are a result of improper investigation and prosecution of\r\ncrime, leading to insufficient evidence. This is evident from the low percentage of cases attracting\r\nthe application of the provisions of the Penal Code relating to false complaints as compared to the\r\nrate of acquittals. 10\r\n13. Section 15A of the SC\/ST Act contains important provisions that safeguard the rights of the\r\nvictims of caste-based atrocities and witnesses. Sub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 15A specifically\r\nmake the victim or their dependent an active stakeholder in the criminal proceedings. These\r\nprovisions enable a member of the marginalized caste to effectively pursue a case and counteract the\r\neffects of defective investigations. Sub-sections (1) to (5) of Section 15A are extracted below:\r\n\u201C15A(1) It shall be the duty and responsibility of the State to make arrangements for\r\nthe protection of victims, their dependents, and witnesses against any kind of\r\nintimidation or coercion or inducement or violence or threats of violence.\r\n(2) A victim shall be treated with fairness, respect and dignity and with due regard to\r\nany special need that arises because of the victims age or gender or educational\r\ndisadvantage or poverty.\r\n(3) A victim or his dependent shall have the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely\r\nnotice of any Court proceeding including any bail proceeding and the Special Public\r\nProsecutor or the State Government shall inform the victim about any proceedings\r\nunder this Act.\r\n(4) A victim or his dependent shall have the right to apply to the Special Court or the\r\nExclusive Special Court, as the case may be, to summon parties for production of any\r\ndocuments or material, witnesses or examine the persons present.\r\n(5) A victim or his dependent shall be entitled to be heard at any proceeding under\r\nthis Act in respect of bail, Sthabir Khora, Misconstruction of the Anti-atrocities Act\u2019s\r\nMisuse, Economic and Political Weekly 53 (15) (14 April 2018).\r\ndischarge, release, parole, conviction or sentence of an accused or any connected proceedings or\r\narguments and file written submission on conviction, acquittal or sentencing.\u201D (emphasis added)\r\n14. Sub-section (3) of Section 15A confers a statutory right on the victim or their dependents to\r\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any court proceeding including a bail proceeding. In\r\naddition, sub-section (3) requires a Special Public Prosecutor or the State Government to inform the\r\nvictim about any proceeding under the Act. Sub-section (3) confers a right to a prior notice, this\r\nbeing evident from the use of the expression \u201Creasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any court\r\nproceeding including any bail proceeding\u201D. Sub-section (5) provides for a right to be heard to the\r\nvictim or to a dependent. The expression \u201Cdependent\u201D is defined in Section 2(bb) thus:\r\n\u201C2(bb) \u201Cdependent\u201D means the spouse, children, parents, brother and sister of the\r\nvictim, who are dependent wholly or mainly on such victim for his support and\r\nmaintenance;\u201D The provisions of sub-section (3) which stipulate the requirement of\r\nnotice and of sub-section (5) which confers a right to be heard must be construed\r\nharmoniously.\r\nThe requirement of issuing a notice facilitates the right to be heard.\r\n15. Many High Court decisions have noted that Section 15A was introduced to protect the rights of\r\nthe victims and witnesses whose rights as equal beneficiaries of the criminal justice system are often\r\noverlooked due to their weak social position. The Madhya Pradesh High Court, in Sunita Gandharva\r\nv. State of MP & Anr, 11while highlighting the purpose of the amendment inserting Section 15A\r\nobserved that:\r\n\u201C21. With the years of experience, it was found that due to some vagueness in the\r\ndefinitions and some procedural inertia, the purpose of Act lacked fulfilment,\r\ntherefore, to make it more victim oriented, the Amendment Act was introduced.\r\n22. With the legislative intent reiterated in the letter, no iota of doubt exists that\r\nintention of the Amendment Act was for Speedy Trial and Protection of Victims'\r\nRights. By way of Section 2 (ec) Victim has been defined and beside Section 14-A,\r\nSection 15-A, \u201CRights of victim and witnesses\u201D was introduced to take care of them for\r\nthe first time. Definition of Victim includes-relatives, legal guardian and legal heirs\r\nand this definition is much wider than the definition of Victim provided in Section 2\r\n(wa) of Cr.P.C. which includes guardian or legal heir, not the relatives. Similarly,\r\nSection 15A of Atrocities Act provides an extensive mechanism for protection of\r\nVictims\/Witnesses. Even the victim has been given a chance to appear before the\r\nCourt at the time of hearing of bail application. Right of the Court to cancel or revoke\r\nthe bail is one of the measures by which protection of Victims\/Witnesses can be\r\nensured\u2026\u201D\r\n16. The Gujarat High Court in Hemal Ashwin Jain v. Union of India12 observed that:\r\n\u201C37. The victims, even today, have no semblance of rights at the investigation stage\r\nand a feeble position at the trial stage of a criminal prosecution.\r\n\u2026\u2026\r\n53. We are also not impressed by the argument of Mr.Popat that Section 15A(3) of the\r\nAmendment Act should be 2020 SCC OnLine MP 2193 R\/Special Civil Application\r\nNo. 6369 of 2020 (Gujarat High Court), available at\r\nhttps:\/\/www.livelaw.in\/pdf_upload\/pdf_upload-380514.pdf (last accessed on 27\r\nOctober 2021).construed as directory and not mandatory. As is evident from a plain reading of the section quoted\r\nabove, the victim must be served with notice of the bail application and must be provided an\r\nopportunity to be heard and advance argument. When a statute specifically provides a right to the\r\nvictim\/dependent to be heard at any proceedings in respect of bail, and if the court fails to provide\r\nsuch opportunity, then there is an inherent failure of justice. This procedure, in our opinion, cannot\r\nbe bypassed. The non-compliance of the provision of Section 15A(3) of the Amendment Act would\r\nrender an order null and void. If Section 15A(3) of the Amendment Act is to be construed as\r\ndirectory, then the very object and purpose with which such provision is enacted would got\r\nfrustrated.\u201D\r\n61. In such circumstances referred to above, we hold that Section 15A(3) of the Amendment Act is\r\nmandatory and not directory\u201D (emphasis supplied).\r\n17. The finding of the Gujarat High Court that the requirement of issuing notice of a court\r\nproceeding to a victim or a dependent under Section 15A (3), in order to provide them an\r\nopportunity of being heard, is mandatory, finds echo in multiple High Court decisions 13 including a\r\ndecision of the Rajasthan High Court 14. We find ourselves in agreement with the proposition and\r\nhold that sub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 15A are mandatory in nature.\r\n18. In the present case, it is evident that the right to notice and to be heard were violated. Initially,\r\nwhen S.B. Criminal Appeal No.1132\/2019 was heard by the High Court against the denial of bail by\r\nthe Special Judge in the first bail application, the appellant was present through counsel. The appeal\r\nunder Section 14A(2) of the Ajeet Chaudhary v. State of UP, 2021 SCC OnLine All 417 (Allahabad\r\nHigh Court); Basheer M. v. State of Kerala, 2020 SCC OnLine Ker 1675 (Kerala High Court); and\r\nMarenna and Ors. v. The State & Ors., 2020 SCC OnLine Kar 1077 (Karnataka High Court).\r\nAbid v. State of Rajasthan, 2020 SCC OnLine Raj 2703.\r\nSC\/ST Act was not pressed by the first respondent and was accordingly dismissed. Section 14A(2) is\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\u201C14A(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3) of section 378 of the\r\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an appeal shall lie to the High Court\r\nagainst an order of the Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court granting or\r\nrefusing bail.\u201D\r\n19. When the High Court entertained S.B. Criminal Appeal No.2518\/2019 on 7 November 2019, no\r\nnotice was given to the appellant. The High Court allowed the application for bail. When the\r\nappellant moved the High Court for cancellation of bail, the Single Judge took the view that\r\ncompliance with the principles of natural justice at that particular stage would cure the deficiency.\r\nThere has been a clear infraction of the mandate of the statute. Sub-sections (3) and (5) have been\r\nintroduced by the Parliament to ensure a right to be heard to the person against whom the offence is\r\ncommitted or to the dependents. These provisions must be scrupulously observed. We cannot agree\r\nwith the finding of the Single Judge that the defect in not issuing notice to the victim or their\r\ndependent and depriving them of the opportunity to be heard in the concerned proceedings (for\r\ngrant of bail) can be cured by providing them a hearing in a proceeding that arose subsequently (for\r\ncancellation of bail). Compliance with the principles of natural justice must be observed at every\r\nstage under the mandate of the statute.\r\n20. Atrocities against members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not a thing of the\r\npast. They continue to be a reality in our society even today. Hence the statutory provisions which\r\nhave been enacted by Parliament as a measure of protecting the constitutional rights of persons\r\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes must be complied with and enforced\r\nconscientiously. There has been an evident breach of the statutory requirements embodied in\r\nsub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 15A in the present case.\r\n21. We also emphasize that sub-section (3) of Section 15A provides that a reasonable and timely\r\nnotice must be issued to the victim or their dependent. This would entail that the notice is served\r\nupon victims or their dependents at the first or earliest possible instance. If undue delay is caused in\r\nthe issuance of notice, the victim, or as the case may be, their dependents, would remain\r\nuninformed of the progress made in the case and it would prejudice their rights to effectively oppose\r\nthe defense of the accused. It would also ultimately delay the bail proceedings or the trial, affecting\r\nthe rights of the accused as well.\r\n22. Quite apart from the infraction of the provisions of the SC\/ST Act, there has been no application\r\nof mind by the Single Judge of the High Court to the considerations that govern the grant of bail.\r\nThis Court recently in Ramesh Bhavan Rathod v. Vishanbhai Hirabhai Makwana 15, of which one of\r\nus was a part (Justice DY Chandrachud), has elaborated on the considerations that govern the grant\r\nof bail. This Court also emphasized that recording of reasons by a judge is not a task in formality,\r\nbut an exercise of judicial accountability and transparency, which makes the decision available for\r\nfurther scrutiny at the touchstone of reason and justice. This Court observed:\r\n(2021) 6 SCC 230 \u201C39. Grant of bail under Section 439 CrPC is a matter involving the\r\nexercise of judicial discretion. Judicial discretion in granting or refusing bail\u2014as in\r\nthe case of any other discretion which is vested in a court as a judicial institution\u2014 is\r\nnot unstructured. The duty to record reasons is a significant safeguard which ensures\r\nthat the discretion which is entrusted to the court is exercised in a judicious manner.\r\nThe recording of reasons in a judicial order ensures that the thought process\r\nunderlying the order is subject to scrutiny and that it meets objective standards of\r\nreason and justice\u2026.\r\n40. We are also constrained to record our disapproval of the manner in which the application for\r\nbail of Vishan (A-6) was disposed of. The High Court sought to support its decision to grant bail by\r\nstating that it had perused the material on record and was granting bail \u201Cwithout discussing the\r\nevidence in detail\u201D taking into consideration:\r\n(1) the facts of the case;\r\n(2) the nature of allegations;\r\n(3) gravity of offences; and (4) role attributed to the accused.\u201D\r\n23. While granting bail to the first respondent, the High Court in its order dated 7\r\nNovember 2019 only recorded the submission of counsel for the first respondent that\r\nPW-2, the spouse of the deceased, had in the course of her statement recorded during\r\nthe trial, stated that the deceased had gone with her brother Kishan Lal; that Kishan\r\nLal had obtained an insurance policy in the name of the deceased and that the\r\nmurder had been committed by Kishan Lal to obtain the proceeds of the insurance\r\npolicy, with the help of his friends. There is absolutely no reasoning in the order of\r\nthe High Court granting bail, after recording the submissions of the first respondent\u2019s\r\ncounsel apart from noting that the public prosecutor had opposed the bail. The High\r\nCourt held that it was just and expedient to release the first respondent on bail\r\n\u201Ckeeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case\u201D. Such orders cannot pass\r\nmuster. The duty to record reasons cannot be obviated by recording submissions,\r\nfollowed by an omnibus \u201Cin the facts and circumstances\u201D formula. Brief reasons\r\nwhich indicate the basis for granting bail are essential, for it is the reasons adduced\r\nby the court which indicate the basis of the order.\r\n24. Before the High Court granted bail by its order dated 7 November 2019, the final\r\nreport had been submitted on 6 September 2018. The final report under Section 173\r\nCrPC contains a detailed analysis of the call data records of the accused who were in\r\ncontinuous contact with each other, as well as of their location in close proximity to\r\nthe date and time of the incident. The bail order does not make any mention of\r\nfactors that are relevant for the grant of bail, which are (i) the seriousness and gravity\r\nof the offence; and (ii) the role attributed to the first respondent in the commission of\r\nthe crime. In this backdrop, the order of the High Court in granting bail cannot pass\r\nmuster. Aggrieved by the order, the appellant had filed an application16 seeking its\r\nrecall. The Single Judge of the High Court by the impugned order dated 8 June 2021\r\nsimply reiterated that the bail was granted on the basis of the statement of the wife of\r\nthe deceased, PW.2, once again failing to show any engagement with the\r\nconsiderations that govern the grant of bail.\r\n25. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned order of the Single Judge of\r\nthe High Court of Judicature at Rajasthan dated 8 June 2021 in S.B. Crl Bail\r\nCancellation Application No. 21\/2020 is set aside. The order granting bail to the S.B.\r\nCriminal Miscellaneous Bail Cancellation Application No. 21\/2020 first respondent\r\ndated 7 November 2019 shall stand set aside. The first respondent shall surrender\r\ninto custody on or before 7 November 2021.\r\n26. The observations made during the course of this judgment are only for the\r\npurpose of considering the grant of bail to the first respondent and shall not have a\r\nbearing on the merits of the case as such.\r\n27. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.\r\n\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...........................J.

          "judgement":"L. NAGESWARA RAO, J.\r\n1. The Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 54 of 2021 are students who appeared in the National\r\nEligibility-cum- Entrance Test (NEET) examination 2020 for admission to the first year of Bachelor\r\nof Dental Surgery (BDS) conducted on 13-09-2020. They did not obtain the minimum marks\r\nprescribed by Sub-Regulation (ii) of Regulation II of the Dental Council of India, Revised BDS\r\nCourse Regulations, 2007 (hereinafter, \u2018the Regulations\u2019). Therefore, they were not eligible for\r\nadmission to BDS course. The second 1 | Page Respondent Dental Council of India, recommended\r\nthe lowering of qualifying cut off percentile for admission to BDS course for the academic year\r\n2020-2021.\r\n2. The Petitioners submitted a representation to Respondent No.1 seeking to lower the qualifying cut\r\noff percentile on the recommendation of the Executive Committee of Respondent No.2. The\r\nrecommendation of the Executive Committee was not accepted by the first Respondent. Having no\r\nother alternative, the Petitioners have filed these Writ Petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution\r\nof India.3. The Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 95 of 2021 are Dental Colleges from the State of Andhra\r\nPradesh seeking a similar direction to lower the minimum marks for NEET examination, 2020 for\r\nadmission to BDS course by 20 percentile in each category based on the recommendation of\r\nRespondent No.2.\r\n4. We have heard Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners in Writ Petition\r\nNo.95 of 2021 and Mr. Krishna Dev Jagarlamudi, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners in\r\nWrit Petition No. 54 of 2021. Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the\r\nproviso to Regulation II (5) (ii) of the Regulations empowers the Central 2 | Page Government to\r\nlower the minimum marks required for admission to BDS course in consultation with the Dental\r\nCouncil of India. In spite of the recommendation made by the Dental Council of India for lowering\r\nthe qualifying cut off percentile, the first Respondent has arbitrarily and unreasonably not acted\r\nupon the recommendation. He stated that the first respondent accepted the proposal of the second\r\nRespondent and lowered the cut off percentile for the year 2019-2020. He also relied upon the\r\nproceedings relating to the lowering of the minimum marks for the Super speciality courses for the\r\nyear 2019-2020 and for admission in Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and\r\nHomeopathy (AYUSH) - UG courses for the year 2020-2021. He contended that percentile is\r\ndifferent from percentage and by lowering the percentile there would be no compromise of\r\nstandards. He argued that 7,000 seats in the first year BDS course are vacant and the available\r\ninfrastructure would be wasted. Mr. Krishna Dev, learned counsel argued that there is no basis for\r\nthe assumption that lowering of the percentile would affect standards of education. There is no basis\r\nfor the allegation that the private colleges have been charging exorbitant fees for which 3 | Page\r\nreason seats in the BDS first year are not being filled up, according to him.\r\n5. Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the first Respondent\r\nhas taken an informed decision on 30.12.2020 not to lower the minimum marks for admission to\r\ndental surgery course for the year 2020-2021 as sufficient number of candidates are available. She\r\nsubmitted that 7.71 lakhs candidates were found to be eligible for filling up 82,000 MBBS and\r\n28,000 BDS course seats. For each vacant seat seven candidates are available. She further\r\nhighlighted the point that there are 2.77 lakh Dentists registered with the Dental Council of India.\r\nTaking into consideration the availability of 80% of Dentists, there is one Dentist for every 6080\r\npersons which is better than the WHO norms of 1 : 7500. It was further contended by her that the\r\nseats in BDS course falling vacant is due to the candidates giving preference to other streams or\r\ntheir disability to pay exorbitant fee charged by the private colleges. Responding to the submissions\r\nmade by the learned Additional Solicitor General, Mr. Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the\r\nPetitioners brought to the notice of this Court that admissions to AYUSH courses are also made\r\nfrom students who qualify in the NEET examination 2021. The 4 | Page addition of 52780 seats in\r\nAYUSH would reduce the ratio of eligible candidates to the seats available in BDS to 1 : 4.5.\r\n6. Sub-Regulation (ii) of Regulation II of the Regulations is as follows:\r\n\u201CIn order to be eligible for admission to BDS Course for a particular academic year, it\r\nshall be necessary for a candidate to obtain minimum of marks of 50th percentile in\r\n\u2018National Eligibility cum-Entrance Test to BDS course\u2019 held for the said academicyear. However, in respect of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled\r\nTribes, Other Backward Classes, the minimum marks shall be at 40th percentile. In\r\nrespect of candidates with locomotory disability of lower amendments, the minimum\r\nmarks shall be at 45th percentile. The percentile shall be determined on the basis of\r\nhighest marks secured in the All-India common merit list in \u201CNational\r\nEligibility-cum-Entrance Test for admission to BDS course.\r\nProvided when sufficient number of candidates in the respective categories fail to\r\nsecure minimum marks as prescribed in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test held\r\nfor any academic year for admission to BDS Course, the Central Government in\r\nconsultation with Dental Council of India may at its discretion lower the minimum\r\nmarks required for admission to BDS Course for candidates belonging to respective\r\ncategories and marks so lowered by the Central Government shall be applicable for\r\nthe said academic year only\u201D.\r\n7. It is clear from the proviso that the Central Government has the discretion to lower the minimum\r\nmarks required for admission to BDS course in consultation with the Dental 5 | Page Council of\r\nIndia when sufficient number of candidates in the respective categories fail to secure minimum\r\nmarks in the NEET entrance test.\r\n8. There is no dispute that on 06-09-2019 the first Respondent lowered the qualifying cut off\r\npercentile for NEET (UG) 2019 for admission to BDS course by 10.00 percentile for each category\r\ni.e. General, SC\/ST\/OBC and persons with locomotor disability of lower limbs. The Dental Council\r\nof India by a letter dated 28.12.2020 proposed that the percentile for admission to BDS course in\r\nDental colleges should be lowered by 20 percentile for each category. It was stated in the said letter\r\nthat only 7,71,500 students qualified for admission to MBBS\/BDS, (UG) AYUSH and other UG\r\nmedical courses for the year 2020-2021. It was made clear by the second Respondent that the\r\nstudents qualified are not commensurate with the sanctioned admission capacity in different\r\ncourses like MBBS, BDS, (UG) AYUSH and other UG medical courses. The second Respondent\r\ninformed the first Respondent that there is shortage of the students for admission to BDS course\r\nand underlined the fact that vacant seats in professional courses would amount to national waste.\r\nHowever, the first Respondent decided not to lower the minimum marks required for admission to\r\nBDS course. In 6 | Page this background, the correctness of the decision of the first Respondent not\r\nto reduce the minimum marks for first year BDS course has to be examined.\r\n9. Judicial review of administrative action is permissible on grounds of illegality, irrationality and\r\nprocedural impropriety. An administrative decision is flawed if it is illegal. A decision is illegal if it\r\npursues an objective other than that for which the power to make the decision was conferred 1.\r\nThere is no unfettered discretion in public law2. Discretion conferred on an authority has to be\r\nnecessarily exercised only for the purpose provided in a Statute. The discretion exercised by the\r\ndecision maker is subject to judicial scrutiny if a purpose other than a specified purpose is pursued.\r\nIf the authority pursues unauthorized purposes his decision is rendered illegal. If irrelevant\r\nconsiderations are taken into account for reaching the decision or relevant considerations have been\r\nignored, the decision stands vitiated as the decision maker has misdirected himself in law. It isuseful to refer to R. vs. St. Pancras Vestry3 in which it was held: -\r\n\u201CIf people who have to exercise a public duty by exercising their discretion take into\r\naccount maters which the Courts consider not to be proper for the exercise of their\r\ndiscretion, then in the eye of law they have not exercised their discretion\u201D.\r\n1 De Smith\u2019s Judicial Review (Sixth Edition pg. 225) 2 Food Corporation of India v.\r\nM\/S Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries, (1993) 1 SCC 71 3 (1890) 24 QBD 37\/ at p.\r\n375 7 | Page\r\n10. The question that arises for our consideration is whether the exercise of the discretion by the\r\nfirst Respondent is for the purpose specified in the Regulations and whether irrelevant\r\nconsiderations have been taken into account making the decision irrational. The proviso to SubRegulation (ii) of Regulation II is clear in its terms empowering the Central Government to exercise\r\nits discretion to lower minimum marks only when sufficient number of candidates fail to secure\r\nminimum marks. The Central Government cannot pursue any purpose other than the one specified\r\nin the proviso to Regulation II (5) (ii). There are three reasons given for the decision not to lower\r\nminimum marks. The first is that the ratio of available seats vis-\u00E0-vis eligible candidates is 1:7 and\r\ntherefore there is no dearth of eligible candidates. The other factor which propelled the Central\r\nGovernment to decide that there is no need to reduce the minimum mark is that there are sufficient\r\nnumber of Dentists in India. Lack of keenness of students to join BDS, especially in private colleges\r\nwhich charge exorbitant fee, as they are interested in MBBS course is yet another ground which\r\nimpelled the decision of the first Respondent.\r\n8 | Page\r\n11. The stand of the Central Government is that there are seven candidates available for each seat\r\nand, therefore, there is no need to lower the minimum marks. This calculation of the first\r\nRespondent is without taking into account the fact that NEET (UG) 2020 is conducted for\r\nadmission into different courses like MBBS, BDS, UG AYUSH and other medical courses.\r\nAdmissions for UG AYUSH and other UG medical courses are included in the NEET for the first\r\ntime from this year. That apart, it is clear from the letter of the Dental Council of India that NEET\r\nhas been made mandatory for admission to AIIMS and AIIMS like institutions and ZIPMER.\r\nHitherto, AIIMS and AIIMS like institutions and other institutions like ZIPMER were conducting\r\ntheir own separate entrance test. The total number of seats available for the academic year\r\n2020-2021 for MBBS are 91,367, BDS are 26,949 and AYUSH are 52,720 making it a total of\r\n1,71,036 seats. Whereas, the NEET qualified candidates are 7,71,500. The ratio of seats available\r\nvis-\u00E0-vis eligible students is 1 : 4.5 and not 7. The basis for the decision to not reduce minimum\r\nmarks that there are sufficient eligible candidates is without considering the above vital facts. The\r\ndecision which materially suffers from the blemish of overlooking or ignoring, wilfully or otherwise,\r\nvital facts 9 | Page bearing on the decision is bad in law 4. The decision of the first respondent was\r\npropelled by extraneous considerations like sufficient number of Dentists being available in the\r\ncountry and the reasons for which students were not inclined to get admitted to BDS course which\r\nremits in the decision being unreasonable. Consideration of factors other than availability of eligible\r\nstudents would be the result of being influenced by irrelevant or extraneous matters. There is an\r\nimplicit obligation on the decision maker to apply his mind to pertinent and proximate matters only,\r\neschewing the irrelevant and the remote5.\r\n12. The first Respondent reduced the minimum marks for admission into first-year BDS course for\r\nthe year 2019-2020 in consultation with the second Respondent. In spite of the recommendation\r\nmade by the second Respondent to reduce the minimum marks for the year 2020-2021, the first\r\nRespondent deemed it fit not to lower the minimum marks for the current year. While arriving at a\r\ndecision on 30.12.2020 not to lower the minimum marks it does not appear that the first\r\nRespondent has consulted the second Respondent in accordance with the proviso to Sub-Regulation\r\n(ii) of the Regulation II. There is no dispute that the 4 Baldev Raj vs. Union of India (1980) 4 SCC\r\n321 5 Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Mahindra & Mahindra, (1983) 4 SCC 392 10 | P a g e\r\nminimum marks have been reduced by the first Respondent for the super speciality courses for the\r\nlast year and AYUSH courses for the current year. If reducing minimum marks amounts to lowering\r\nthe standards, the first Respondent would not do so for super speciality courses. We are in\r\nagreement with Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners that lowering the\r\nminimum marks and reducing percentile for admission to the first-year BDS course would not\r\namount to lowering the standards of education.\r\n13. There are about 7,000 seats available for admission to the first-year BDS course during the year\r\n2020-2021. We are not impressed by the argument of the learned Additional Solicitor General that\r\nthere are sufficient number of Dentists in the country and, therefore, there is no harm in the seats\r\nbeing unfilled. However, we find force in the submission made by the learned Additional Solicitor\r\nGeneral that the fee charged by the private dental colleges is a deterrent for the seats not being filled\r\nup. Only 265 out of 7,000 seats are vacant in government colleges. All the other unfilled seats are in\r\nprivate Dental colleges. The Managements of private Dental Colleges shall consider reducing the fee\r\ncharged by them to encourage students to join the Colleges. Reliance 11 | P a g e was placed by the\r\nfirst Respondent in an order passed by this Court in Union of India v. Federation of Self-Financed\r\nAyurvedic Colleges, Punjab, (2020) SCC 115 to submit that non-availability of eligible candidates for\r\nadmission to AYUSH (UG) courses cannot be a reason to lower the standards prescribed by the\r\nCentral Council for admission. The facts of this case are entirely different as the Dental Council of\r\nIndia itself recommended for lowering the minimum marks and the Regulations provide for\r\nlowering the minimum marks. That apart, the first Respondent has exercised its discretion and\r\nlowered the minimum marks for admission to first-year BDS course for the year 2019-2020.\r\n14. For the aforementioned reasons, we set aside the decision of the first Respondent dated\r\n30.12.2020 to not reduce the minimum marks for admission to BDS course as it suffers from the\r\nvices of illegality and irrationality. We direct that the vacant seats in first year BDS course for the\r\nyear 2020-2021 shall be filled up from the candidates who have participated in the NEET (UG)\r\ncourses for the year 2020-2021 after lowering the percentile mark by 10 percentile. The candidates\r\nbelonging to the general category who have secured 40 percentile shall be eligible to be considered\r\nfor admission in the first year BDS course for the 12 | P a g e year 2020-2021. Likewise, students\r\nbelonging to the SC\/ST\/OBC categories shall be qualified if they have secured 30 percentile.

HARSAC invoked the arbitration clause contained in the Service Level Agreement, and appointed\r\nShri. Anurag Rastogi, IAS, Principal Secretary to Government of Haryana as their nominee\r\narbitrator.\r\nThe Respondent appointed Justice Rajive Bhalla (Retd.) as their nominee arbitrator on 14.09.2016.\r\nOn 14.09.2016, the arbitral tribunal stood constituted.\r\n5. The Respondent \/ Pan India Consultants filed an Application for appointment of the presiding\r\narbitrator under Section 10(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the arbitral\r\ntribunal. The tribunal vide Order dated 22.05.2017 declined the request for appointment of the third\r\narbitrator at this stage, and reserved its right to nominate the third arbitrator in case of\r\ndisagreement between the two arbitrators.\r\n6. On 03.08.2018, the arbitral tribunal in its 28 th sitting, recorded in the proceedings that the\r\narguments were heard, and the matter was reserved for passing the Award.\r\n7. The Appellant addressed letter dated 07.01.2019 to the arbitral tribunal wherein it was stated that\r\nthe arbitration proceedings had been pending for more than 1 \u00BD years since the date of first hearing\r\non 07.11.2016. That vide Order dated 25.01.2018, the tribunal had extended the period of arbitration\r\nby 3 months. Since the proceedings were not completed even within the extended period, time was\r\nagain extended on 15.05.2018 for a further period of 3 months. The extended period also expired on\r\n15.08.2018. The tribunal had even then not pronounced the Award till date. Since, the arbitral\r\nproceedings were not completed within the statutory period of 1 year as prescribed by the\r\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or the extended period of 6 months, the mandate of the\r\narbitral tribunal would stand terminated.\r\n8. On 08.02.2019, Justice Rajive Bhalla (Retd.), one of the arbitrators, in a letter addressed to the\r\nRespondent stated that after arguments were concluded, the Award was in the process of\r\npreparation, when a letter dated 07.01.2019 was received from the Director Land Record, Haryana,\r\nPanchkula, stating that the mandate of the tribunal stood terminated. However, this letter did not\r\nmake reference to the clarification sought by the Respondents regarding the fee of the tribunal. It\r\nwas stated by the arbitrator that : \u201C The tribunal is ready to pronounce the award forthwith.\u201D\r\n9. The Respondent \/ Contractor filed an Application under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration Act\r\nbeing Arb. Case No. 431 of 2019 before the Additional District Judge, Chandigarh, wherein it was\r\nstated that the Award was ready to be pronounced, and the entire fee had been paid to the tribunal.\r\nIt was contended that the Director Land Records had not paid their share of the fee, but were\r\ndelaying the matter, and had erroneously claimed that the mandate of the tribunal stood\r\nterminated. It was prayed that the period for passing the arbitral award be extended.\r\n10. The Appellant herein opposed the Application and submitted that the Application under Section\r\n29A(4) be dismissed since sufficient cause for granting extension had not been made out.\r\n11. The District Judge vide its Order dated 08.11.2019 granted an extension of time of 3 months to\r\nthe tribunal to conclude the arbitration proceedings, and pronounce the Award.\r\n12. The Appellant herein filed Civil Revision Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution before the\r\nPunjab and Haryana High Court for setting aside the Order dated 08.11.2019 passed by the\r\nAdditional District Judge, whereby an extension of time had been granted for passing the Award. It\r\nwas submitted that the extension of time had been mutually agreed by both parties upto 15.08.2018.\r\nHowever, the tribunal failed to pronounce the Award even within this extended period, and did not\r\nshow any inclination of doing so even on 07.01.2019, when the letter terminating the mandate of the\r\ntribunal was sent. The tribunal failed to pronounce the Award in a period of over 28 months from\r\nthe date of constitution of the tribunal.\r\n13. The learned Single Judge of the High Court passed an Interim Order dated 31.07.2020 wherein\r\nit was observed that since the period of 3 months granted by the District Court had already elapsed,\r\nboth parties were directed to obtain instructions for grant of a period of 3 months on account of the\r\nprevailing Pandemic. The tribunal would conduct the proceedings either virtually or physically14. The Petition was heard on 24.08.2020, when the learned Additional Advocate General, Haryana\r\nopposed the extension of time. The High Court, in light of the current Pandemic, granted an\r\nextension of 4 months to enable the parties to conclude their arguments within 3 months, and a\r\nperiod of 1 month for the tribunal to pass the Award.\r\n15. Aggrieved by the said Order, HARSAC has filed the present Special Leave Petition. We have\r\nheard the learned Additional Advocate General appearing for HARSAC, and Mr. Angad Mehta for\r\nthe Respondent- Contractor.\r\n16. We find that even though a period of over 4 years has elapsed since the constitution of the\r\ntribunal on 14.09.2016, the Award has not been pronounced so far, even though the tribunal had on\r\ntwo occasions i.e. 03.08.2018 in its 28th sitting, and thereafter in the letter dated 08.02.2019\r\naddressed by the arbitrators, recorded that the tribunal was ready to pronounce the Award\r\nforthwith.\r\n17. We are of the view that the appointment of the Principal Secretary, Government of Haryana as\r\nthe nominee arbitrator of HARSAC which is a Nodal Agency of the Government of Haryana, would\r\nbe invalid under Section 12(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with the Seventh\r\nSchedule. Section 12(5) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 (as amended by the 2015 Amendment Act)\r\nprovides that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship\r\nwith the parties, or counsel, falls within any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, shall\r\nbe ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator.\r\nItem 5 of the Seventh Schedule of the Act reads as under :\r\n\u201CArbitrator\u2019s relationship with the parties or counsel\r\n5. The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the management, or has a similar\r\ncontrolling influence, in an affiliate of one of the parties if the affiliate is directly\r\ninvolved in the matters in dispute in the arbitration.\u201D (emphasis supplied) Section\r\n12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule is a mandatory and nonderogable provision of the Act. In the facts of the present case, the Principal Secretary to the\r\nGovernment of Haryana would be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, since he would have a\r\ncontrolling influence on the Appellant Company being a nodal agency of the State.\r\n18. The Counsel for both parties during the course of hearing have consented to the substitution of\r\nthe existing tribunal, by the appointment of a Sole Arbitrator to complete the arbitral proceedings.\r\nIn exercise of our power under Section 29A(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (as\r\namended), we hereby appoint Justice Kurian Joseph (Retd.), former judge of this Court, as the\r\nsubstitute arbitrator, who will conduct the proceedings in continuation from the stage arrived at,\r\nand pass the Award within a period of 6 months from the date of receipt of this Order. The\r\nArbitrator may direct the parties to address final arguments and take him through the entire recordof the case.\r\nThe appointment of the Sole Arbitrator is subject to the declarations being made under Section 12 of\r\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 with respect to independence and impartiality, and the\r\nability to devote sufficient time to complete the arbitration within the period of 6 months.\r\nThe arbitrator will charge fees in accordance with the Fourth Schedule of the Arbitration and\r\nConciliation Act, 1996. We direct both parties to equally share the fees payable to the Sole\r\nArbitrator. The proceedings will be conducted either virtually, or at the seat of arbitration in the\r\nState of Haryana.\r\nThe matter is disposed of accordingly. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed.\r\n\u2026.................................................J. (L. NAGESWARA RAO) \u2026.................................................J.

          "judgement":"S.ABDUL NAZEER, J.\r\nLeave granted.\r\n2. These appeals are directed against the Orders dated 30.12.2015 and 06.01.2016 in Case C.C.\r\nNo.381\/SA\/2014 passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Esplanade, Mumbai, rejecting the\r\nApplication (Exh.\u22128) filed by the appellant herein for restraining HDFC Bank, the first respondent\r\nherein, from taking possession of the property in the appellant\u2019s possession.\r\n3. HDFC Bank had granted financial facility to respondent nos.2 and 3 (for short, \u2018the Borrowers\u2019) of\r\nRs.5,50,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees Five Crore Fifty Lakhs). On 03.04.2013, the Borrowers had mortgaged a\r\nproperty bearing Flat No.501, 5 th Floor, Solitaire, Village Kopari, Adi Shankaracharya Road,\r\nMHADA Layout, Powai, Andheri (E), Mumbai (for short, \u201Cthe Secured Asset\u201D) in favour of the Bank\r\nwith an intention to secure the said credit facility.\r\n4. The accounts of the Borrowers were declared as non\u2212 performing assets (NPA) on 31.10.2013. On\r\n25.01.2014, the Bank issued a notice under Section 13(2) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of\r\nFinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (for short, \u201CSARFAESI Act\u201D) to the\r\nBorrowers. It is the case of the appellant that he is a tenant of the Secured Asset on a monthly rent of\r\nRs.20,000\/\u2212 since 12.06.2012 with an increase of 5% every year. He has been paying rent regularly\r\nto his landlord since inception of his tenancy.\r\n5. The appellant filed Exh.8 application before the Magistrate seeking protection of his possession of\r\nthe Secured Asset as the Magistrate was ceased with the petition under Section 14 of SARFAESI Act\r\nfiled by the respondent no.1\u2212Bank. Vide Order dated 30.12.2015, the intervention application of the\r\nappellant was dismissed by the Magistrate holding that there was no registered tenancy placed on\r\nrecord by the appellant.\r\n6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the appellant would contend\r\nthat the appellant is a protected tenant under the provisions of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act\r\n1999. He has been paying rent regularly to the landlord. He has also paid advance rent till\r\n17.12.2018. There are continuous rent receipts with him from the date of his induction as a tenant.\r\nThe tenant was residing in the said premises on the basis of an oral tenancy from 12.06.2012.\r\nTherefore, he cannot be evicted from the Secured Asset without due process of law.\r\n7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent\u2212Bank submits that the rent receipt said to\r\nhave been issued by the landlord for the period from 12.06.2012 to 12.05.2013 is of 12.05.2013\r\nwhich is after the date of creation of mortgage in favour of the Bank. There is absolutely no material\r\nto show that the tenancy was created earlier to the date of mortgage. The tenancy pleaded by the\r\nappellant is an oral tenancy. At the time of grant of facility, third\u2212party valuers had confirmed that\r\nthe Borrowers were staying at the Secured Asset. The Borrowers, while making representation to the\r\nBank, have not claimed that any tenant is staying at the Secured Asset. The tenancy claimed by the\r\nappellant is an after\u2212thought which cannot be believed in the facts and circumstances of the case.\r\nHe prays for dismissal of the appeal.\r\n8. We have carefully considered the submissions made at the Bar and perused the materials placed\r\non the record.\r\n9. As noticed above, it is the case of the appellant that he is a tenant of the Secured Asset since\r\n12.06.2012 and has paid advance rent upto 17.12.2018. The documents produced by the appellant\r\nare xerox copies of the rent receipts. However, in response to the notice issued under Section 13(2)\r\nof the SARFAESI Act, the Borrowers have sent a very detailed representation wherein they have not\r\nclaimed that any tenant is staying at the Secured Asset. The appellant has pleaded tenancy from\r\n12.06.2012 to 17.12.2018. The rent receipt claiming tenancy from 12.06.2012 is a xerox copy of\r\n12.05.2013, which is after the date of creation of mortgage.\r\n10. Procedural mechanism for taking possession of the Secured Asset is provided under Section 14 of\r\nthe SARFAESI Act. Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act provides for the right of appeal to any person\r\nincluding the borrower to approach Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT). Section 17 has been amended by\r\nAct No. 44 of 2016 providing for challenging the measures to recover secured debts (for short, \u201Cthe\r\nAmendment\u201D). Under the Amendment, possession can be restored to the borrower or such other\r\naggrieved person. This Amendment has come into force w.e.f. 1st September, 2016. This Court in\r\nHarshad Govardhan Sondagar v. International Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd. & Ors. 1 has held that\r\nright of appeal is available to the tenant claiming under the borrower. In Kanaiyalal Lalchand\r\nSachdev v. State of Maharashtra2 this Court has held that DRT can not only set aside the action of\r\nthe secured creditor but even restore the status quo ante. Therefore, an alternative remedy was\r\navailable to the appellant to challenge the impugned order under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act\r\neven before the amendment to Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. However, given (2014) 6 SCC 1\r\n(2011) 2 SCC 782 that the instant appeal has been pending consideration before this Court from the\r\nyear 2016, we propose to examine the case on merits without directing the appellant to avail the\r\nalternative remedy.\r\n11. In Harshad Govardhan Sondagar (supra) this Court has categorically held that if the tenancy\r\nclaim is for any term exceeding one year, the tenancy can be made only by a registered instrument.\r\nIt was held thus :\r\n\u201C36. We may now consider the contention of the respondents that some of the\r\nappellants have not produced any document to prove that they are bona fide lessees\r\nof the secured assets. We find that in the cases before us, the appellants have relied\r\non the written instruments or rent receipts issued by the landlord to the tenant.\r\nSection 107 of the Transfer of Property Act provides that a lease of immovable\r\nproperty from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly\r\nrent, can be made \u201Conly by a registered instrument\u201D and all other leases of immovable\r\nproperty may be made either by a registered instrument or by oral agreement\r\naccompanied by delivery of possession. Hence, if any of the appellants claim that they\r\nare entitled to possession of a secured asset for any term exceeding one year from the\r\ndate of the lease made in his favour, he has to produce proof of execution of a\r\nregistered instrument in his favour by the lessor. Where he does not produce proof of\r\nexecution of a registered instrument in his favour and instead relies on an\r\nunregistered instrument or oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession,\r\nthe Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate, as the case may be, will\r\nhave to come to the conclusion that he is not entitled to the possession of the secured\r\nasset for more than a year from the date of the instrument or from the date of\r\ndelivery of possession in his favour by the landlord.\u201D\r\n12. A Three\u2212Judge Bench of this Court in Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal v. Central Bank of India &\r\nAnr.3, after considering almost all decisions of this Court, in relation to the right of a tenant in\r\npossession of the secured asset, has held that if a valid tenancy under law is in existence even prior\r\nto the creation of the mortgage, such tenant\u2019s possession cannot be disturbed by the secured creditor\r\nby taking possession of the property. If a tenancy under law comes into existence after the creation\r\nof a mortgage but prior to issuance of a notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, it has to\r\nsatisfy the conditions of Section 65\u2212A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. If a tenant claims that\r\nhe is entitled to possession of a Secured Asset for a term of more than a year, it has to be supported\r\nby the execution of a registered instrument. In the said decision of this Court, it was clarified that in\r\nthe absence of a registered instrument, if the tenant only relies upon an unregistered instrument or\r\nan oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession, the tenant is not entitled to possession of\r\nthe secured asset for more than the period prescribed under the provisions of the Transfer of\r\nProperty Act. It was held thus:\r\n(2019) 9 SCC 94 \u201C24.1. If a valid tenancy under law is in existence even prior to the\r\ncreation of the mortgage, the tenant\u2019s possession cannot be disturbed by the secured\r\ncreditor by taking possession of the property. The lease has to be determined in\r\naccordance with Section 111 of the TP Act for determination of leases. As the\r\nexistence of a prior existing lease inevitably affects the risk undertaken by the bank\r\nwhile providing the loan, it is expected of banks\/creditors to have conducted a\r\nstandard due diligence in this regard.\r\nWhere the bank has proceeded to accept such a property as mortgage, it will be presumed that it has\r\nconsented to the risk that comes as a consequence of the existing tenancy. In such a situation, the\r\nrights of a rightful tenant cannot be compromised under the SARFAESI Act proceedings. 24.2. If a\r\ntenancy under law comes into existence after the creation of a mortgage, but prior to the issuance of\r\nnotice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, it has to satisfy the conditions of Section 65-A of\r\nthe TP Act.\r\n24.3. In any case, if any of the tenants claim that he is entitled to possession of a secured asset for a\r\nterm of more than a year, it has to be supported by the execution of a registered instrument. In the\r\nabsence of a registered instrument, if the tenant relies on an unregistered instrument or an oral\r\nagreement accompanied by delivery of possession, the tenant is not entitled to possession of the\r\nsecured asset for more than the period prescribed under Section 107 of the TP Act.\u201D\r\n13. It was further held that the Rent Act would not come to the aid of a \u201Ctenant\u2212in\u2212sufferance\u201D vis\u2212\r\n\u00E0\u2212vis SARFAESI Act due to the operation of Section 13(2) read with Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI\r\nAct. It was held as follows:\r\n\u201C35. The operation of the Rent Act cannot be extended to a \u201Ctenant\u2212in\u2212sufferance\u201D\r\nvis\u2212\u00E0\u2212vis the SARFAESI Act, due to the operation of Section 13(2) read with Section\r\n13(13) of the SARFAESI Act. A contrary interpretation would violate the intention of\r\nthe legislature to provide for Section 13(13), which has a valuable role in making the\r\nSARFAESI Act a self\u2212executory instrument for debts recovery. Moreover, such an\r\ninterpretation would also violate the mandate of Section 35, SARFAESI Act which is\r\ncouched in broad terms.\u201D\r\n14. In the present case, first of all there is a serious doubt as to the bona fide of the tenant, as there is\r\nno good or sufficient evidence to establish the tenancy of the appellant. According to the appellant,\r\nhe is a tenant of the Secured Asset from 12.06.2012. However, the documents produced in support\r\nof his claim are xerox copies of the rent receipts and the first xerox copy of the rent receipt is of\r\n12.05.2013 which is after the date of creation of the mortgage. It is pertinent to note here that the\r\nBorrowers have not claimed that any tenant is staying at the Secured Asset. At the time of grant of\r\nfacility, third\u2212party valuers had also confirmed that the Borrowers were staying at the Secured\r\nAsset. Be that as it may. The appellant has pleaded tenancy from 12.06.2012 to 17.12.2018. This is\r\nnot supported by any registered instrument. Further, even according to the appellant, he is a\r\n\u201Ctenant\u2212in\u2212sufferance\u201D, therefore, he is not entitled to any protection of the Rent Act. Secondly,\r\neven if the tenancy has been claimed to be renewed in terms of Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act,\r\nthe Borrower would be required to seek consent of the secured creditor for transfer of the Secured\r\nAsset by way of sale, lease or otherwise, after issuance of the notice under Section 13(2) of the\r\nSARFAESI Act and, admittedly, no such consent has been sought by the Borrower in the present\r\ncase.\r\n15. In view of above, we do not find any merit in these appeals which are accordingly dismissed.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J. (S.

          "judgement":"R.SUBHASH REDDY,J.\r\n1. This appeal is filed by the Himachal Road Transport Corporation and another, aggrieved by the\r\njudgment and Order dated 08.01.2009, passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, at Shimla in\r\nCWP No. 1362 of 2001.\r\n2. The Himachal Road Transport Corporation is established under The Road Transport\r\nCorporations Act, 16:16:29 IST Reason:\r\n1950. The employees of the Corporation were governed by the Contributory\r\nProvident Fund Scheme (CPF). The appellant-Corporation introduced a Pension\r\nScheme in the year 1995, by issuing a Notification dated 06.10.1995 and adopted\r\nCentral Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 1972. The second appellant has approved the\r\nScheme formulated by the Corporation. The Pension Scheme was given effect to from\r\n05.06.1995, that is from the date on which Scheme was approved by the Cabinet\/\r\nGovernment. For the employees who retired from 05.06.1995, till the date of\r\nnotification, i.e, 06.10.1995 and for the employees in service, an option was given\r\neither to opt for Pension Scheme, or to continue under the Contributory Provident\r\nFund. Clause 5 of the Scheme, stipulates eligibility criteria to opt for Pension Scheme.\r\n3. The respondent-Union, consisting of the employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995, approached\r\nthe Administrative Tribunal by filing Original Application in OA (D) No. 237\/1996, for grant of\r\nfollowing reliefs:\r\n\u201Ci) That the cut off date for grant of pension to those employees who were in service\r\nof the Corporation as on June 5, 1995 be quashed and set aside;\r\nii) That the applicants i.e. pre June 5, 1995 employees, may be held entitled for\r\npension as the other similarly situated employees between June 5, 1995 to October 6,\r\n1995 have been given the benefit as per Clause 5 of the said Scheme;\r\niii) That the action of the respondents Corporation in denying pension to the\r\napplicants may be declared illegal, unjust, unreasonable, arbitrary and violative of\r\nArticle 14, 16, 21.\u201D The respondent-union, relying on a judgment of this Court in the\r\ncase of D.S. Nakara & Ors. v. Union of India1 and several other judgments, pleaded\r\nthat the fixation of cut-off date was arbitrary and discriminatory.\r\n4. The appellants have contested the Original Application, filed by the respondent-Union, inter alia\r\npleading that they have introduced a Pension Scheme to the employees of the Corporation, with\r\neffect from 05.06.1995, on which date Cabinet has approved the Scheme. It was the plea of the\r\nappellants that all the employees of the Corporation, who retired prior to 05.06.1995, were already\r\npaid all the retiral benefits including the benefit of Contributory Provident Fund, as such the cut-off\r\ndate fixed, i.e, 05.06.1995, for 1 AIR 1983 SC 130 = (1983) 1 SCC 305 implementing the Pension\r\nScheme, was not discriminatory.\r\n5. The Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, by judgment dated 19.06.2001, dismissed the\r\nOriginal Application filed by the respondent-Union, by holding that the appellants are entitled to fix\r\nthe cut-off date for introducing the Pension Scheme for its employees and such fixation is not\r\ndiscriminatory. It was held that all the employees of the Union, who were governed by the\r\nContributory Provident Fund, on their retirement, have already availed the benefit of such fund. It\r\nwas further noticed by the Tribunal that, as the Cabinet has approved the Scheme in its meeting\r\nheld on 05.06.1995 as such, the Scheme was given effect to from such date. By recording a finding\r\nthat the employees who were already retired prior to 05.06.1995, constitute a different category and\r\nare not similarly placed as those employees who were in service of the appellant-Corporation as on\r\n05.06.1995, dismissed the Original Application.\r\n6. The respondent-Union, aggrieved by the judgment and Order of the Administrative Tribunal,\r\napproached the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, at Shimla, by way of Civil Writ Petition No. 1362\r\nof 2001. In the Writ Petition filed, mainly it was the case of the respondent-Union that, the cut-off\r\ndate, i.e, 05.06.1995, fixed by the Corporation for implementation of Pension Scheme is\r\ndiscriminatory and has no reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. It was the plea of\r\nUnion that all the employees of the Corporation, constitute a homogeneous class and there cannot\r\nbe a classification within the class. By impugned judgment and Order dated 08.01.2009, the High\r\nCourt has allowed the Writ Petition, by quashing the cut-off date, on the ground that no reasons\r\nwere forthcoming from the appellant- Corporation, for picking up the cut-off date, i.e, 05.06.1995,\r\nfor implementation of Pension Scheme. Further, High Court has declared that the Scheme which\r\nwas notified on 06.10.1995, shall apply to the members of the respondent-Union and other similarly\r\nsituated persons, with a condition that they will have to deposit the amount received by them under\r\nthe Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, within a reasonable time. The High Court has set aside\r\nthe Order of the Administrative Tribunal dated 19.06.2001, passed in OA (D) 237\/1996.\r\n7. Aggrieved by the said judgment and order passed by the High Court, the Road Transport\r\nCorporation is before us, by way of this civil appeal.\r\n8. We have heard Sri Himanshu Tyagi, learned counsel appearing for the appellant-Corporation and\r\nSri M.C. Dhingra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent- applicant.\r\n9. It is contended by Sri Himanshu Tyagi, learned counsel for the appellant-Corporation that,\r\nthough there is no discrimination in fixing the cut-off date, i.e, 05.06.1995, by way of Notification\r\ndated 06.10.1995, the High Court has allowed the writ petition, without assigning valid reasons. It is\r\nsubmitted that the employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995, by availing the benefit of\r\nContributory Provident Fund Scheme, constitute a separate class. After availing the benefit of\r\nContributory Provident Fund Scheme, on their retirement, it is not open to plead that Pension\r\nScheme, as notified for the existing employees and the employees retired between 05.06.1995 and\r\n06.10.1995 is discriminatory. The employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995, and the employees\r\npresently in service, cannot be treated as a homogeneous class. It is submitted that, it is always open\r\nfor the employer to extend further benefits to the employees prospectively. When such Scheme is\r\nintroduced with effect from the date of its approval, i.e, 05.06.1995, same is rightly not extended to\r\nthe employees who retired prior to 05.06.1995. The Pension Scheme was approved by the Cabinet\r\non 05.06.1995, as such it cannot be said that such a fixation is either arbitrary or illegal.\r\n10. On the other hand, Sri M.C. Dhingra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-applicant,\r\nhas submitted that there is absolutely no reason or justification for fixing the cut-off date, i.e,\r\n05.06.1995, for implementation of Pension Scheme. It is submitted that all the employees of the\r\nCorporation constitute one homogeneous class and the appellant- Corporation should not have\r\nmade any distinction among such class of employees. It is submitted that, as no valid reasons have\r\nbeen assigned by the appellant- Corporation, for fixing the cut-off date, as such the High Court has\r\nrightly allowed the Writ Petition and there are no grounds to interfere with the same. Further\r\nsubmissions of learned counsel for the respondent is that, though the Pension Scheme was notified\r\nvide Notification dated 06.10.1995, same was given effect to retrospectively from 05.06.1995, as\r\nsuch there is no reason for not extending such benefit to the employees who retired prior to\r\n05.06.1995 also. With the contentions, as referred above, learned counsel prayed for dismissal of the\r\ncivil appeal.\r\n11. Having heard the learned counsels on both sides, we have perused the impugned order of the\r\nHigh Court, the order passed by the Tribunal and other material placed on record.\r\n12. Before entering into the contentious issue of fixation of cut-off date, for extending the benefit of\r\nPension Scheme by the Corporation, we need to notice certain factual aspects emerging from the\r\npleadings of the parties and other material on record.\r\n13. The members of the respondent-Union were initially employed by the Mandi- Kullu Road\r\nTransport Corporation. By Order dated 24.09.1974, the said Corporation was re-named as\r\n\u201CHimachal Road Transport Corporation\u201D and vide notification dated 01.10.1974, the Himachal\r\nPradesh State Government has taken over the services of such employees with effect from\r\n02.10.1974. All the members of the respondent-Union, who were retired, were governed by the\r\nContributory Provident Fund Scheme, after their services were taken over by the Corporation with\r\neffect from 02.10.1974. The State Government has notified the Pension Scheme on 06.10.1995,\r\nhowever, the same was made applicable with effect from 05.06.1995. The Administrative Tribunal,\r\nby drawing a distinction on the facts from the case of D.S. Nakara1 and other judgments relied on,\r\non behalf of the respondent, has held that the point which arises in the instant case is different from\r\nthe cases relied upon. The Tribunal has held that the members of the respondent-Union were\r\ngoverned by the Contributory Provident Fund and had, on their retirement, availed such benefit\r\nwhereas the Scheme of pension was made applicable with effect from 05.06.1995, as per the\r\nNotification dated 06.10.1995. The Tribunal, by recording a finding that the employees who already\r\nretired by availing the benefit under the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, constitute a different\r\ncategory and are not similarly placed as those employees who were in service of the Corporation on\r\n05.06.1995, on which date the Scheme was approved, has dismissed the Original Application.\r\n14. When the order of the Tribunal, rejecting the claim of the respondent-Union was challenged, by\r\nway of Civil Writ Petition, the High Court, by referring to certain cases decided by this Court,\r\nwithout any independent assessment on the issue in question, has allowed the writ petition, by\r\nimpugned order.\r\n15. In the case of D.S. Nakara1, this Court had treated the pension retirees only, as a homogeneous\r\nclass and all the pensioners governed by The 1972 Rules, were treated as a class, because payment of\r\npension was a continuing obligation on the part of the State, till life long to the pensioners, unlike\r\nthe beneficiaries of the Contributory Provident Fund. In the said case, it was never held that the\r\npension retirees and the employees in service, constitute a homogeneous class. In the case of R.L\r\nMarwaha v. Union of India and others2, this Court has held that fixing of a date for grant of benefit,\r\nmust have nexus with the object sought to be achieved. There cannot be any 2 1987(4) SCC 31\r\ndispute on the proposition. Further, the case of Union of India and another v. Deoki Nandan\r\nAggarwal3, relates to fixation of cut-off date, for grant of liberalized Pension Scheme. Even in the\r\ncase of Subrata Sen and others v. Union of India and others4, where a cut-off date was fixed for the\r\npurpose of applicability of revised pension scheme this Court has held that all retired employees\r\nconstitute one homogeneous class and there cannot be cut-off date fixed to extend such benefits. All\r\nthe above said cases which are referred to and relied on by the High Court are not relevant and\r\ncannot be pressed into service, to decide the issue which arises on the facts of this case.\r\n16. Though there are long line of cases, where validity of fixation of cut-off date is considered by this\r\nCourt, we confine and refer to the case law which is relevant to the facts of the case on hand. In the\r\ncase of State of Punjab v. Amar Nath Goyal5, while examining the validity of cut-off date fixed for\r\ngrant of benefit of increased quantum of death-cum- 3 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 323 4 (2001)8 SCC 71 5\r\n(2005)6 SCC 754 retirement gratuity, this Court has held that the financial constraint pleaded by the\r\nGovernment, was a valid ground for fixation of cut-off date and such fixation was not arbitrary,\r\nirrational or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. While differentiating the facts with the case of\r\nD.S. Nakara1, this Court held in para 29 of the judgment, which reads as under:\r\n \u201C29. D.S. Nakara1 which is the\r\n mainstay of the case of the\r\n employees arose under special\r\ncircumstances, quite different from the present case. It was a case of revision of pensionary benefits\r\nand classification of pensioners into two groups by drawing a cut-off line and granting the revised\r\npensionary benefits to employees retiring on or after the cut-off date. The criterion made applicable\r\nwas \u201Cbeing in service and retiring subsequent to the specified date\u201D. This Court held that for being\r\neligible for liberalised Pension Scheme, application of such a criterion is violative of Article 14 of the\r\nConstitution, as it was both arbitrary and discriminatory in nature. The reason given by the Court\r\nwas that the employees who retired prior to a specified date, and those who retired thereafter\r\nformed one class of pensioners. The attempt to classify them into separate classes\/groups for the\r\npurpose of pensionary benefits was not founded on any intelligible dirrerentia, which had a rational\r\nnexus with the object sought to be achieved. However, it must be noted that even in cases of\r\npension, subsequent judgments of this Court have considerably watered down the rigid view taken\r\nin D.S. Nakara1 as we shall see later in T.N. Electricity Board v. R.Veerasamy (\u201CVeerasamy\u201D). In any\r\nevent, this is not a case of a continuing benefit like pension; it is a one-time benefit like gratuity.\u201D\r\n17. In the case of Govt. of Andhra Pradesh & others v. N. Subbarayudu & others6, by noticing that a\r\nrigid view was taken in the case of D.S. Nakara1, this Court has considerably watered down the same\r\nand has held that fixing the cut-off date is an executive function based on several factors like\r\neconomic conditions, financial constraints, administrative and other circumstances. This Court\r\nfurther held that even if no reason is forthcoming from executive, for fixation of a particular date, it\r\nshould not be interfered by Court, unless cut-off date leads to some blatantly capricious or\r\noutrageous result.\r\n18. In the case of Suchet Singh Yadav and others v. Union of India and others7, of which one of us is\r\na party, (Hon\u2019ble Ashok Bhushan,J.), while examining the 6 (2008)14, SCC 702 7 (2019)11 SCC 520\r\nclaim of commissioned officers of defence forces, i.e, Army, Air force and Navy, who retired prior to\r\n01.01.1996, for grant of next higher pay scale, on the strength of Order of Government of India dated\r\n21.11.1997, which was issued in consequence of implementation of Fifth Pay Commission Report,\r\nthis Court has not accepted the plea of discrimination. In the said judgment, it is held that\r\npensioners, for purposes of pension, constitute one class and schemes which classify pensioners on\r\nbasis of cut-off date are impermissible unless such classification is founded on some rational\r\nprinciple. On the facts of the case, in the aforesaid judgment it is held that the Order which was\r\nissued by the Government of India on 21.11.1997, is applicable only to existing officers and not\r\nretirees. Further in the case of All Manipur Pensioners Association by its Secretary v. The State of\r\nManipur and others8, of which, one of us is a party, (Hon\u2019ble M.R.Shah,J.), when validity of Office\r\nMemorandum dated 21.04.1999, issued for revising the quantum of pension by fixing the cut-off\r\ndate on 01.01.1996 is questioned, this Court has held that all 8 (2019)9 Scale, 282 pensioners form\r\nonly one homogeneous class and held that such a fixation of date for extending the benefits of\r\nrevised benefits to the pensioners, is arbitrary and violates Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n19. Coming back to the facts of the case on hand, by applying the case law which is referred above, it\r\nis clear that all the members of the respondent-Union, while in service, were governed by\r\nContributory Provident Fund Scheme. All those employees who retired before 05.06.1995, were paid\r\nall retiral benefits, applicable to them. As the Pension Scheme was not in existence during the\r\nrelevant time, it was not the case of violation of any service conditions either. The Pension Scheme is\r\nintroduced by way of notification dated 06.10.1995, by giving effect from 05.06.1995, on which date\r\nthe Cabinet has approved the Scheme. The employees who were governed by the Contributory\r\nProvident Fund Scheme and retired prior to 05.06.1995 and the employees who were in service and\r\ncontinued after 05.06.1995, of the appellant- Corporation, cannot be treated as a homogeneous\r\nclass. The retired employees, who were governed by the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, on\r\ntheir retirement had already received the benefits of such Scheme, constitute different class than\r\nthose employees who were in service as on 05.06.1995. There is a valid reason for giving effect to the\r\nPension Scheme from 05.06.1995, though the notification was issued on 06.10.1995. The cut-off\r\ndate, i.e, 05.06.1995 is fixed on the ground that the Cabinet has approved the Scheme from such\r\ndate. As already noticed above, it is always open for the employer to introduce new Schemes and\r\nbenefits, having regard to financial health of the employer. Whenever such new benefit is extended\r\nfor the existing employees, retired employees cannot seek such benefit, merely on the ground that\r\nthey too were the former employees of the Corporation. In spite of specific plea of the\r\nappellant-Corporation that the benefit of the Scheme was extended from 05.06.1995, in view of\r\napproval granted by the Cabinet to the Scheme, the High Court has erroneously recorded a finding\r\nthat no reason has been assigned to choose such cut-off date. It is true that all pensioners constitute\r\none class and whenever, revision is effected, ordinarily such benefit is to be extended to all the\r\npensioners but at the same time, the scenario in the case on hand, is totally different. On the facts of\r\nthis case, it is to be noticed that when the members of the respondent-Union retired, there was no\r\nPension Scheme at all. They were merely governed by the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme and,\r\non retirement, they were already granted the benefit of such Scheme. In that view of the matter, only\r\non the spacious plea that all the employees of the Corporation constitute homogeneous class, cannot\r\nquestion the cut-off date fixed for grant of Pension Scheme.\r\n20. It is profitable to refer a judgment of this Court, in the case of State of Rajasthan and Another v.\r\nAmrit Lal Gandhi and others9. The ratio decided in the said case is identical to the issue on hand in\r\nthe present case. In the aforesaid case, pursuant to recommendations made in the year 1986, by a\r\ncommittee appointed by University Grants Commission, the Syndicate and Senate of the University\r\nhas recommended for introducing a Pension Scheme for the employees of the University. The State\r\nGovernment\u2019s approval was sought, which was given for introducing the Scheme 9 (1997) 2 SCC 342\r\nwith effect from 01.01.1990. When such fixation of cut-off date from 01.01.90 was found fault with,\r\nby the High Court and the High Court issued directions to give effect from 01.01.1986, while\r\nreversing the judgment of the High Court, this Court has held that fixation of cut-off date from\r\n01.01.1990 cannot be said to be arbitrary or discriminatory. Relevant paragraph Nos. 16 and 17 of\r\nthe judgment, read as under:\r\n\u201C16. Applying the ratio of the aforesaid decisions to the present case, we find no\r\njustification for the High Court having substituted the date of 1-1-1986 in lieu of\r\n1-1-1990. It is evident that for introducing a pension scheme, which envisaged\r\nfinancial implications, approval of the Rajasthan Government was required. In the\r\nletter of 16-4-1991, written to the Vice-Chancellors of different universities of\r\nRajasthan, it was stated as follows:\r\n\u201CAs per the direction in regard to the aforesaid subject, the State Government has\r\ndecided to introduce Pension Scheme in the Universities of the State w.e.f. 1-1-1990.\r\nIn this regard the State Legislature has passed University Pension Rules and General\r\nProvident Fund Rules. Therefore, by enclosing a copy of University Pension\r\nRegulations and General Provident Fund Regulations with this letter, it is requested\r\nthat by obtaining approval of the competent body or Syndicate of the University,\r\nthese Regulations be implemented in the University together and necessary\r\ninformation regarding implementation be intimated.\u201D\r\n17. The Syndicate and Senate of the University, when they had forwarded their\r\nrecommendations in 1986, did not contain a specific date with effect from which the\r\npension scheme was to be made applicable.\r\nTheir recommendations were subject to approval. The approval was granted by the Government,\r\nafter the State Legislature had passed the University Pension Rules and General Provident Fund\r\nRules. The Government had stated in its affidavit before the High Court that the justification of the\r\ncut-off date of 1-1-1990 was \u201Cwholly economic\u201D. It cannot be said that the paying capacity is not a\r\nrelevant or valid consideration while fixing the cut-off date. The University could, in 1991, validly\r\nframe Pension Regulations to be made applicable prospectively. It, however, chose to give them\r\nlimited retrospectively so as to cover a larger number of employees by taking into account the\r\nfinancial impact of giving retrospective operation to the Pension Regulations. It was decided that\r\nemployees retiring on or after 1-1-1990 would be able to exercise the option of getting either pension\r\nor provident fund. Financial impact of making the Regulations retrospective can be the sole\r\nconsideration while fixing a cut-off date. In our opinion, it cannot be said that this cut-off date was\r\nfixed arbitrarily or without any reason. The High Court was clearly in error in allowing the writ\r\npetitions and substituting the date of 1-1-1986 for 1-1-1990.\u201D\r\n21. The High Court, without noticing the difference of factual background, in the cases relied on by\r\nthe respondent-writ petitioner and without independently considering the issue in question, has\r\nallowed the writ petition. In view of the same, we are of the view that judgment of the High Court\r\ndeserves to be set aside.\r\n22. Accordingly, this civil appeal is allowed. Judgment of the High Court dated 08.01.2009, passed\r\nin Civil Writ Petition No. 1362 of 2001 is set aside, consequently said writ petition stands dismissed,\r\nwith no order as to costs.\r\n.........................J.

          "judgement":"1. By way of this appeal under Section 62 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 20161, the\r\nappellant India Resurgence ARC Private Limited seeks to question the order dated 02.03.2021\r\npassed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi 2 in CA(AT) (Insolvency) No.\r\n1061 of 2020, whereby the Appellate Authority rejected its challenge to the order dated 20.10.2020\r\npassed by the National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench, Kolkata 3in approval of the\r\nresolution plan in the corporate insolvency resolution process4concerning 1Hereinafter also referred\r\nto as \u2018the Code\u2019 or \u2018IBC\u2019. 2Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Appellate Authority\u2019 or \u2018NCLAT\u2019.\r\n3Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Adjudicating Authority\u2019 or \u2018NCLT\u2019. 4\u2018CIRP\u2019 for short.\r\nthe corporate debtor VSP Udyog Private Limited (respondent No. 2 herein), as submitted by the\r\nresolution applicant Amit Metaliks Limited (respondent No. 1 herein).\r\n2. The appellant company is said to be the assignee of the rights, title and interest carried by\r\nReligare Finvest Limited as secured financial creditor of the corporate debtor, having 3.94% of\r\nvoting share in the Committee of Creditors5.\r\n3. When the resolution plan submitted by the respondent No. 1 was taken up for consideration by\r\nthe CoC, the appellant expressed reservations on the share being proposed, particularly with\r\nreference to the value of the security interest held by it; and chose to remain a dissentient financial\r\ncreditor. The dissention on the part of the appellant and response thereto by the resolution\r\nprofessional as also by other members of CoC was noted in the 14th meeting of CoC dated\r\n31.07.2020 in the following words: -\r\n\u201CRepresentative from Religare Finvest\/India Resurgence ARC, Mr Shakti inquired\r\nabout the lower share they are getting as per Resolution Plan whereas the security\r\ninterest held by them is far more. He also raised question about the fair market value\r\nand liquidation value of the CD. On this the RP informed him that the valuation\r\nexercise has been done by registered valuers of IBBI who were appointed by the\r\nerstwhile IRP and he do not find any inconsistency in the same. Other members also\r\nagreed on the same. Mr Shakti then raised the point that in the present scenario it\r\nwill be better for them if the company goes into Liquidation and they will realize their\r\nsecurity interest by exercising option u\/s 52(1)(b). The RP then replied that\r\nLiquidation option may be beneficial to one creditor but is definitely detrimental to\r\nother 5\u2018CoC\u2019 for short.\r\nsecured lenders who are having majority stake of around 96%.\r\nFurther the RP also said that the objective of IBC is resolution and revival of a\r\ndistressed company and is not a recovery procedure.\u201D 3.1. However, a substantial\r\nmajority of other financial creditors voted in favour of the resolution plan and,\r\ntherefore, the resolution plan got the approval of 95.35% of voting share of the\r\nfinancial creditors.\r\n4. The said resolution plan, as approved by the vast majority of voting share in the\r\nCoC, was submitted for approval by the resolution professional to the Adjudicating\r\nAuthority. The Adjudicating Authority examined, inter alia, the salient features of\r\nresolution plan, particularly those concerning financial proposals; and found the plan\r\nto be feasible and viable with judicious distribution of financial bids by CoC to the\r\nstakeholders according to their entitlements as also being compliant of all the\r\nmandatory requirements. The Adjudicating Authority stated its complete satisfaction\r\nand proceeded to approve the resolution plan while observing in its order dated\r\n20.10.2020 (as amended on 21.10.2020) as under: -\r\n\u201C13. Having heard the Ld. Senior Counsel and on perusal of the Plan, it is understood\r\nthat the assets of the Corporate Debtor are going to rest in a safer hand. The RP, Mr.\r\nRaj Singhania, deserves special appreciation for finding out a Resolution Applicant,\r\nwhose Plan has been approved by the Committee of Creditors by 95.35% voting\r\nshare, even in these difficult times of pandemic, due to COVID-19. All the provisions\r\nof mandatory requirements are seen complied with by the Resolution Applicant, as\r\nper Form H, submitted by the RP. It makes provision for the payment of the\r\nInsolvency Resolution Process, payment of the debts of Operational Creditors,\r\nManagement of the affairs of the Corporate Debtor, and also provision for\r\nimplementation and supervision of the Resolution Plan. It also provides terms of the\r\nPlan and its implementation schedule. So it is a feasible and viable Plan. A judicious\r\ndistribution of the financial bids by the COC to the stakeholders according to their\r\nentitlements can be inferred from the Plan under consideration. No waiver of\r\nextinguishments in contravention of the provisions of the Code or in violation of\r\nexisting laws is seen not brought out and therefore, there is nothing in the Plan, so as\r\nto disapprove it. This CP was admitted on 7th August, 2019. However, upon expiry of\r\n180 days, the period of CIRP was extended, excluding the days last during the period\r\nof lockdown imposed by the Central Government in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak,\r\nnot to be counted for the purposes of the time-line for any activity that could not be\r\ncompleted due to such lockdown, in relation to a Corporate Insolvency Resolution\r\nProcess and thereby, approval of the Plan by the COC within the period of 270 days.\r\nThe COC has very well deliberated with the Plans received by it and decided the\r\nviability, feasibility and financial matrix of each Plan and approved one with 95.35%\r\nvote shares of the members of the Committee of Creditors.\u201D\r\n5. It does not appear if any objection to the resolution plan was placed before the\r\nAdjudicating Authority for consideration. Be that as it may, against the order so\r\npassed by the Adjudicating Authority, the appellant preferred an appeal under\r\nSection 61(1) read with Section 61(3) of the Code. It was contended on behalf of the\r\nappellant, in its capacity as a dissenting financial creditor, that the approved\r\nresolution plan failed the test of being \u2018feasible and viable\u2019 inasmuch as the value of\r\nthe secured asset, on which security interest was created by the corporate debtor in\r\nits favour, was not taken into consideration. It was contended by the appellant that\r\nafter the amendment to sub-section (4) of Section 30 of IBC, which came into effect\r\nfrom 16.08.2019, the CoC was to ensure that the manner of distribution takes into\r\naccount the order of priority among the creditors as also the priority and value of the\r\nsecurity interest of a secured creditor; and the resolution applicant and the CoC\r\nhaving failed to consider the existing security interest in its favour, approval of the\r\nAdjudicating Authority was not in accordance with law.\r\n6. The Appellate Authority took note of the submissions made on behalf of the\r\nappellant and referred to the decision of this Court in Committee of Creditors of\r\nEssar Steel India Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta and Ors.: (2020) 8 SCC 5316to\r\nstress upon the principles governing various classes of creditors in the insolvency\r\nresolution process. The Appellate Authority particularly referred to the passages in\r\nEssar Steel explaining the meaning and contours of the concept of equitable\r\ntreatment of creditors, including the observations that equitable treatment of\r\ncreditors meant equitable treatment only within the same class; and that protection\r\nof creditors in general was important but it was also imperative that the creditors be\r\nprotected from each other; and further that the Code should not be read so as to\r\nimbue the creditors with greater rights in a bankruptcy proceeding than they would\r\nenjoy under the general law, unless it is to serve some bankruptcy purpose\r\n6.1. Having taken note of the principles expounded in Essar Steel (supra), the\r\nAppellate Authority proceeded to reject the contentions urged on behalf of the\r\nappellant with the following observations and findings: -\r\n\u201C6. Section 30(4) of the I&B Code provides that the Committee of Creditors may\r\napprove a Resolution Plan by a vote which shall not 6 Hereinafter referred to as the\r\ncase of \u2018Essar Steel\u2019.\r\nbe less than 66% of voting share of Financial Creditors. Such approval is to be done after\r\nconsidering the feasibility and viability of the Resolution Plan, the manner of distribution proposed\r\ntherein having regard to the order of priority amongst the creditors in terms of the waterfall\r\nmechanism laid down in Section 53 of the I&B Code including the priority and value of security\r\ninterest of Secured Creditor besides other requirements specified by IBBI. On a plain reading of this\r\nprovision it is manifestly clear that the considerations regarding feasibility and viability of the\r\nResolution Plan, distribution proposed with reference to the order of priority amongst creditors as\r\nper statutory distribution mechanism including priority and value of security interest of Secured\r\nCreditor are matters which fall within the exclusive domain of Committee of Creditors for\r\nconsideration. These considerations must be present to the mind of the Committee of Creditors\r\nwhile taking a decision in regard to approval of a Resolution Plan with vote share of requisite\r\nmajority. As regards amendment introduced in Section 30(4), be it seen that the amendment that it,\r\nintroduced vide Section 6 (b) of Amending Act of 2019 vests discretion in the Committee of\r\nCreditors to take into account the value of security interest of a Secured Creditor in approving of a\r\nResolution Plan. It\u2019s a guideline and not imperative in terms, which may be taken into account by\r\nthe Committee of Creditors in arriving at a decision as regards approval or rejection of a Resolution\r\nPlan, such decision being essentially a business decision based on commercial wisdom of the\r\nCommittee of Creditors. In this regard the observations of Hon\u2019ble Apex Court in \u2018Committee of\r\nCreditors of Essar Steel India LimitedVs. Satish Kumar Gupta and Others\u2019 (Supra) are significant.\r\nThe Hon\u2019ble Apex Court observed as under:-\r\n\u201C131. The challenge to sub-clause (b) of Section 6 of the Amending Act of 2019, again\r\ngoes to the flexibility that the Code gives to the Committee of Creditors to approve or\r\nnot to approve a resolution plan and which may take into account different classes of\r\ncreditors as is mentioned in Section 53, and different priorities and values of security\r\ninterests of a secured creditor. This flexibility is referred to in the BLRC Report,\r\n2015(see para 56 of this judgment). Also, the discretion given to the Committee of\r\nCreditors by the word \u201Cmay\u201D again makes it clear that this is only a guideline which is\r\nset out by this sub-section which may be applied by the Committee of Creditors in\r\narriving at a business decision as to acceptance or rejection of are solution plan. For\r\nall these reasons, therefore, it is difficult to hold that any of these provisions is\r\nconstitutionally infirm.\u201D\r\n7. It abundantly clear that the considerations including priority in scheme of\r\ndistribution and the value of security are matters falling within the realm of\r\nCommittee of Creditors. Such considerations, being relevant only for purposes for.\r\narriving at a business decision in exercise of commercial wisdom of the Committee of\r\nCreditors, cannot be the subject of judicial review in appeal within the parameters of\r\nSection 61(3) of I&B Code. While it is true that prior to amendment of Section 30(4)\r\nthe Committee of Creditors was not required to consider the value of security interest\r\nobtaining in favour of a Secured Creditor while arriving at a decision in regard to\r\nfeasibility and viability of a Resolution Plan, legislature brought in the amendment to\r\namplify the scope of considerations which may be taken into consideration by the\r\nCommittee of Creditors while exercising their commercial wisdom in taking the\r\nbusiness decision to approve or reject the Resolution Plan. Such consideration is only\r\naimed at arming the Committee of Creditors with more teeth so as to take an\r\ninformed decision in regard to viability and feasibility of a Resolution Plan, fairness\r\nof distribution amongst similarly situated creditors being the bottomline.\r\nHowever, such business decision taken in exercise of commercial wisdom of Committee of creditors\r\nwould not warrant judicial intervention unless creditors belonging to a class being similarly situated\r\nare not given a fair and equitable treatment.\r\n8. We find no merit in this appeal, it is accordingly dismissed.\u201D\r\n7. Seeking to question the decision of the Appellate Authority, the main plank of submissions of\r\nlearned counsel for the appellant before us again revolves around Section 30(4) of Code. It is\r\ncontended that the CoC could not have approved the resolution plan which failed to consider the\r\npriority and value of security interest of the creditors while deciding the manner of distribution to\r\neach creditor even though the legislature in its wisdom has amended Section 30(4) of the Code,\r\nrequiring the CoC to take into account the order of priority amongst creditors as laid down in\r\nSection 53(1) of the Code, including the priority and value of the security interest of a secured\r\ncreditor. Learned counsel would submit that the primary reason for appellant\u2019s dissent to the\r\nresolution plan was that, as against total admitted claim of over INR 13.38 crores, the resolution\r\napplicant had offered the appellant a meagre amount of about INR 2.026 crores without even\r\nconsidering the valuation of the security held by the appellant, which admittedly had the valuation\r\nof more than INR 12 crores. Learned counsel has referred to the decision in Essar Steel (supra) as\r\nalso the recent decision of this Court in the case of Jaypee Kensington Boulevard Apartments\r\nWelfare Association and Ors. v. NBCC (India) Ltd. and Ors., rendered on 24.03.20217. Learned\r\ncounsel would submit that the consideration of NCLAT that the amendment to Section 30(4) of the\r\nCode was merely a guideline fails to take into account the fact that CoC does not have an unfettered\r\nand arbitrary right to exercise its commercial wisdom and to approve the plan which does not stand\r\nin conformity with the provisions of the Code.\r\n8. Having heard the learned counsel and having perused the material placed on record, we are\r\nclearly of the view that this appeal remains totally bereft of substance and does not merit admission.\r\n9. The requirements of law, particularly in regard to the contentions sought to be urged on behalf of\r\nthe appellant, are referable to the provisions contained in Section 30 of the Code dealing with the\r\nprocesses relating to submission of a resolution plan, its mandatory contents, its 7 Hereinafter\r\nreferred to as the case of \u2018Jaypee Kensington\u2019. consideration and approval by the Committee of\r\nCreditors, and its submission to the Adjudicating Authority for approval.

In the case of Jaypee Kensington (supra), this Court, after\r\ntaking note of the previous decisions in Essar Steel(supra) as also in K. Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas\r\nBank and Ors.: (2019) 12 SCC 150 and Maharashtra Seamless Limited v. Padmanabhan Venkatesh\r\nand Ors.: (2020) 11 SCC 467, summarised the principles as follows:-\r\n\u201C77. In the scheme of IBC, where approval of resolution plan is exclusively in the\r\ndomain of the commercial wisdom of CoC, the scope of judicial review is\r\ncorrespondingly circumscribed by the provisions contained in Section 31 as regards\r\napproval of the Adjudicating Authority and in Section 32 read with Section 61 as\r\nregards the scope of appeal against the order of approval. 77.1. Such limitations on\r\njudicial review have been duly underscored by this Court in the decisions\r\nabove-referred, where it has been laid down in explicit terms that the powers of the\r\nAdjudicating Authority dealing with the resolution plan do not extend to examine the\r\ncorrectness or otherwise of the commercial wisdom exercised by the CoC. The limited\r\njudicial review available to Adjudicating Authority lies within the four corners of\r\nSection 30(2) of the Code, which would essentially be to examine that the resolution\r\nplan does not contravene any of the provisions of law for the time being in force, it\r\nconforms to such other requirements as may be specified by the Board, and it\r\nprovides for: (a) payment of insolvency resolution process costs in priority; (b)\r\npayment of debts of operational creditors; (c) payment of debts of dissenting\r\nfinancial creditors; (d) for management of affairs of corporate debtor after approval\r\nof the resolution plan; and (e) implementation and supervision of the resolution plan.\r\n77.2. The limitations on the scope of judicial review are reinforced by the limited\r\nground provided for an appeal against an order approving a resolution plan, namely,\r\nif the plan is in contravention of the provisions of any law for the time being in force;\r\nor there has been material irregularity in exercise of the powers by the resolution\r\nprofessional during the corporate insolvency resolution period; or the debts owed to\r\nthe operational creditors have not been provided for; or the insolvency resolution\r\nprocess costs have not been provided for repayment in priority; or the resolution plan\r\ndoes not comply with any other criteria specified by the Board.\r\n77.3. The material propositions laid down in Essar Steel (supra) on the extent of\r\njudicial review are that the Adjudicating Authority would see if CoC has taken into\r\naccount the fact that the corporate debtor needs to keep going as a going concern\r\nduring the insolvency resolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its\r\nassets; and that the interests of all stakeholders including operational creditors have\r\nbeen taken care of. And, if the Adjudicating Authority would find on a given set of\r\nfacts that the requisite parameters have not been kept in view, it may send the\r\nresolution plan back to the Committee of Creditors for resubmission after satisfying the parameters. Then, as observed in Maharashtra Seamless Ltd.\r\n(supra), there is no scope for the Adjudicating Authority or the Appellate Authority to proceed on\r\nany equitable perception or to assess the resolution plan on the basis of quantitative analysis. Thus,\r\nthe treatment of any debt or asset is essentially required to be left to the collective commercial\r\nwisdom of the financial creditors.\u201D\r\n11. It needs hardly any elaboration that financial proposal in the resolution plan forms the core of\r\nthe business decision of Committee of Creditors. Once it is found that all the mandatory\r\nrequirements have been duly complied with and taken care of, the process of judicial review cannot\r\nbe stretched to carry out quantitative analysis qua a particular creditor or any stakeholder, who may\r\ncarry his own dissatisfaction. In other words, in the scheme of IBC, every dissatisfaction does not\r\npartake the character of a legal grievance and cannot be taken up as a ground of appeal.15\r\n12. The provisions of amended sub-section (4) of Section 30 of the Code, on which excessive reliance\r\nis placed on behalf of the appellant, in 15For the purpose of illustration, reference may be made to\r\nthe decision in Jaypee Kensington(supra) wherein, as regards the grounds sought to be urged by\r\nminority shareholders against the resolution plan, this Court held that their grievances could not be\r\nrecognised as legal grievances (videparagraph 154). Similarly, when this Court noticed that the\r\nhomebuyers as a class assented to the plan, it was held that any individual homebuyer or association\r\nwas not entitled to maintain achallenge to the resolution plan and could not be treated as carrying\r\nany legal grievance(vide paragraph 170). our view, do not make out any case for interference with\r\nthe resolution plan at the instance of the appellant. The purport and effect of the amendment to\r\nsub-section (4) of Section 30 of the Code, by way of sub- clause (b) of Section 6 of the Amending Act\r\nof 2019, was also explained by this Court in Essar Steel(supra), as duly taken note of by the\r\nAppellate Authority (vide the extraction hereinbefore).The NCLAT was, therefore, right in observing\r\nthat such amendment to sub-section (4) of Section 30 only amplified the considerations for the\r\nCommittee of Creditors while exercising its commercial wisdom so as to take an informed decision\r\nin regard to the viability and feasibility of resolution plan, with fairness of distribution amongst\r\nsimilarly situated creditors; and the business decision taken in exercise of the commercial wisdom of\r\nCoC does not call for interference unless creditors belonging to a class being similarly situated are\r\ndenied fair and equitable treatment.\r\n12.1. In regard to the question of fair and equitable treatment, though the Adjudicating Authority as\r\nalso the Appellate Authority have returned concurrent findings in favour of the resolution plan yet,\r\nto satisfy ourselves, we have gone through the financial proposal in the resolution plan. What we\r\nfind is that the proposal for payment to all the secured financial creditors (all of them ought to be\r\ncarrying security interest with them) is equitable and the proposal for payment to the appellant is at\r\npar with the percentage of payment proposed for other secured financial creditors. No case of denial\r\nof fair and equitable treatment or disregard of priority is made out.\r\n13. The repeated submissions on behalf of the appellant with reference to the value of its security\r\ninterest neither carry any meaning nor any substance. What the dissenting financial creditor is\r\nentitled to is specified in the later part of sub-section (2)(b) of Section 30 of the Code and the same\r\nhas been explained by this Court in Essar Steel as under:-\r\n\u201C128. When it comes to the validity of the substitution of Section 30(2)(b) by Section\r\n6 of the Amending Act of 2019, it is clear that the substituted Section 30(2)(b) gives\r\noperational creditors something more than was given earlier as it is the higher of the\r\nfigures mentioned in sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of sub-clause (b) that is now to be paid as\r\na minimum amount to operational creditors. The same goes for the latter part of\r\nsub-clause (b) which refers to dissentient financial creditors. Ms Madhavi Divan is\r\ncorrect in her argument that Section 30(2)(b) is in fact a beneficial provision in\r\nfavour of operational creditors and dissentient financial creditors as they are now to\r\nbe paid a certain minimum amount, the minimum in the case of operational creditors\r\nbeing the higher of the two figures calculated under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause\r\n(b), and the minimum in the case of dissentient financial creditor being a minimum\r\namount that was not earlier payable. As a matter of fact, pre-amendment, secured\r\nfinancial creditors may cramdown unsecured financial creditors who are dissentient,\r\nthe majority vote of 66% voting to give them nothing or next to nothing for their\r\ndues. In the earlier regime it may have been possible to have done this but after the\r\namendment such financial creditors are now to be paid the minimum amount\r\nmentioned in sub-section (2). Ms Madhavi Divan is also correct in stating that the\r\norder of priority of payment of creditors mentioned in Section 53 is not engrafted in\r\nsub-section (2)(b) as amended. Section 53 is only referred to in order that a certain\r\nminimum figure be paid to different classes of operational and financial creditors. It\r\nis only for this purpose that Section 53(1) is to be looked at as it is clear that it is the\r\ncommercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors that is free to determine what\r\namounts be paid to different classes and subclasses of creditors in accordance with the provisions of the Code and the Regulations made\r\nthereunder.\u201D (underlining supplied for emphasis) 13.1. Thus, what amount is to be paid to different\r\nclasses or sub- classes of creditors in accordance with provisions of the Code and the related\r\nRegulations, is essentially the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors; and a dissenting\r\nsecured creditor like the appellant cannot suggest a higher amount to be paid to it with reference to\r\nthe value of the security interest.\r\n14. In the case of Jaypee Kensington (supra), the proposal in the resolution plan was to the effect\r\nthat if the dissenting financial creditors would be entitled to some amount in the nature of\r\nliquidation value in terms of Sections 30 and 53 of IBC read with Regulation 38 of the CIRP\r\nRegulations, they would be provided such liquidation value in the form of proportionate share in the\r\nequity of a special purpose vehicle proposed to be set up and with transfer of certain land parcels\r\nbelonging to corporate debtor. Such method of meeting with the liability towards dissenting\r\nfinancial creditors in the resolution plan was disapproved by the Adjudicating Authority; and this\r\npart of the order of the Adjudicating Authority was upheld by this Court with the finding that the\r\nproposal in the resolution plan was not in accord with the requirement of \u2018payment\u2019 as envisaged by\r\nclause (b) of Section 30(2) of the Code 16. In that context, 16In Jaypee Kensington, after\r\ndisapproving the proposition of the resolution plan regarding dissenting financial creditor, the\r\nAdjudicating Authority itself modified the offending terms of the plan and provided for monetary\r\npayment to the dissenting financial creditor. This latter part of the order of the Adjudicating\r\nAuthority was not approved by this Court while holding that after disapproval of such term related\r\nwith financial model proposed in the resolution plan, the Adjudicating Authority itself could not\r\nhave modified the same and ought to have sent the matter back to CoC for reconsideration.\r\nHowever, that part of the decision in Jaypee Kensingtonis not relevant for the present purpose.\r\nthis Court held that such action of \u2018payment\u2019 could only be by handing over the quantum of money\r\nor allowing the recovery of such money by enforcement of security interest, as per the entitlement of\r\na dissenting financial creditor. This Court further made it clear that in case a valid security interest\r\nis held by a dissenting financial creditor, the entitlement of such dissenting financial creditor to\r\nreceive the amount could be satisfied by allowing him to enforce the security interest, to the extent\r\nof the value receivable by him and in the order of priority available to him. This Court clarified that\r\nby enforcing such a security interest, a dissenting financial creditor would receive payment to the\r\nextent of his entitlement and that would satisfy the requirement of Section 30(2)(b) of the Code.\r\nThis Court, interalia, observed and held as under: -\r\n\u201C121.1. Therefore, when, for the purpose of discharge of obligation mentioned in the\r\nsecond part of clause (b) of Section 30(2) of the Code, the dissenting financial\r\ncreditors are to be \u201Cpaid\u201D an \u201Camount\u201D quantified in terms of the \u201Cproceeds\u201D of assets\r\nreceivable under Section 53 of the Code; and the \u201Camount payable\u201D is to be \u201Cpaid\u201D in\r\npriority over their assenting counterparts, the statute is referring only to the sum of\r\nmoney and not anything else. In the frame and purport of the provision and also the\r\nscheme of the Code, the expression \u201Cpayment\u201D is clearly descriptive of the action of\r\ndischarge of obligation and at the same time, is also prescriptive of the mode of\r\nundertaking such an action. And, that action could only be of handing over thequantum of money, or allowing the recovery of such money by enforcement of\r\nsecurity interest, as per the entitlement of the dissenting financial creditor.\r\n121.2. We would hasten to observe that in case a dissenting financial creditor is a\r\nsecured creditor and a valid security interest is created in his favour and is existing,\r\nthe entitlement of such a dissenting financial creditor to receive the \u201Camount\r\npayable\u201D could also be satisfied by allowing him to enforce the security interest, to the\r\nextent of the value receivable by him and in the order of priority available to him.\r\nObviously, by enforcing such a security interest, a dissenting financial creditor would\r\nreceive \u201Cpayment\u201D to the extent of his entitlement and that would satisfy the\r\nrequirement of Section 30(2)(b) of the Code\u2026.\u201D (underlining supplied for emphasis)\r\n14.1. In Jaypee Kensington(supra), this Court repeatedly made it clear that a\r\ndissenting financial creditor would be receiving the payment of the amount as per his\r\nentitlement; and that entitlement could also be satisfied by allowing him to enforce\r\nthe security interest, to the extent of the value receivable by him. It has never been\r\nlaid down that if a dissenting financial creditor is having a security available with\r\nhim, he would be entitled to enforce the entire of security interest or to receive the\r\nentire value of the security available with him. It is but obvious that his dealing with\r\nthe security interest, if occasion so arise, would be conditioned by the extent of value\r\nreceivable by him.\r\n14.2. The extent of value receivable by the appellant is distinctly given out in the\r\nresolution plan i.e., a sum of INR 2.026 crores which is in the same proportion and\r\npercentage as provided to the other secured financial creditors with reference to their\r\nrespective admitted claims.\r\nRepeated reference on behalf of the appellant to the value of security at about INR 12 crores is\r\nwholly inapt and is rather ill-conceived.\r\n15. The limitation on the extent of the amount receivable by a dissenting financial creditor is innate\r\nin Section 30(2)(b) of the Code and has been further exposited in the decisions aforesaid. It has not\r\nbeen the intent of the legislature that a security interest available to a dissenting financial creditor\r\nover the assets of the corporate debtor gives him some right over and above other financial creditors\r\nso as to enforce the entire of the security interest and thereby bring about an inequitable scenario,\r\nby receiving excess amount, beyond the receivable liquidation value proposed for the same class of\r\ncreditors.\r\n16. It needs hardly any emphasis that if the propositions suggested on behalf of the appellant were to\r\nbe accepted, the result would be that rather than insolvency resolution and maximisation of the\r\nvalue of assets of the corporate debtor, the processes would lead to more liquidations, with every\r\nsecured financial creditor opting to stand on dissent. Such a result would be defeating the very\r\npurpose envisaged by the Code; and cannot be countenanced. We may profitably refer to the\r\nrelevant observations in this regard by this Court in Essar Steel as follows:-\r\n\u201C85. Indeed, if an \"equality for all\" approach recognising the rights of different classes\r\nof creditors as part of an insolvency resolution process is adopted, secured financial\r\ncreditors will, in many cases, be incentivised to vote for liquidation rather than\r\nresolution, as they would have better rights if the corporate debtor was to be\r\nliquidated rather than a resolution plan being approved. This would defeat the entire\r\nobjective of the Code which is to first ensure that resolution of distressed assets takes\r\nplace and only if the same is not possible should liquidation follow.\u201D\r\n17. Viewed from any angle, the submissions made on behalf of the appellant do not merit acceptance\r\nand are required to be rejected.\r\n18. For what has been discussed hereinabove, this appeal fails and stands dismissed.\r\n..\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

          "judgement":"S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.\r\n1. Leave granted. With consent, counsel for both parties were heard finally, for disposal of the\r\nappeal.\r\n2. The petitioner, (hereafter variously \u201CIIT\u201D or \u201Cthe Institute\u201D) is aggrieved by a judgment of the\r\nsingle judge, of the Calcutta High Court1, which allowed a writ petition, filed by the respondent\r\nherein (hereafter called by his name, \u201CSoutrik\u201D) holding that the rejection of his candidature for\r\nadmission to the Joint Entrance WPA No. 11673\/ 2020 decided on 25-08-2021 Examination (JEE)\r\nAdvanced, was not justified, and further directing the IIT to decide the issue afresh, and till its\r\ndecision was taken, permit him to register for the JEE and appear in the examination if no decision\r\nwere taken.\r\n3. Soutrik appeared in the Joint Entrance Examination (Main), 2020 and on the basis of the\r\npercentile obtained by him was qualified and eligible to appear in the JEE (Advanced), 2020. He\r\nscored rank 4015 which was not up to his expectation. He participated in the counselling process for\r\nadmission in the institute and secured admission in the Chemical Engineering Dual Course, at IIT\r\nKharagpur. The common entrance examination system for the 23 IITs is based on the JEE (Main)\r\nexamination, conducted by the National Testing Agency in four phases, which culminates in a merit\r\nlist drawn up for students vying for admission in the 23 IITs and 87 National Institute of\r\nTechnologies (NITs), Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) and certain government\r\nfunded institutes. The four phases of these JEE (Main) examinations are conducted on various\r\ndates. Amongst those who compete for the JEE (Main) exam, those falling in the top 2.5 lakhs of\r\nthose students, based on merit are allowed to register for admission to the JEE (Advanced)\r\nexamination.\r\n4. Soutrik wished to appear in JEE, 2021 to secure admission to a course of his choice, but the\r\neligibility criteria for appearing in JEE (Advanced), 2021 prevented him from doing so. The\r\neligibility criteria, is so framed that a candidate can attempt JEE (Advanced) a maximum of two\r\ntimes in consecutive years irrespective of whether or not he passed the qualifying examination. It\r\nfurther stipulates that a candidate who had taken admission in any institute other than IITs in 2020\r\nis eligible to appear in JEE (Advanced), 2021 provided she or he satisfies other eligibility criteria. In\r\nview of the aforesaid restriction Soutrik could not compete in JEE (Advanced), 2021 as he got\r\nhimself admitted in IIT Kharagpur in the year 2020. In these circumstances, he approached the\r\ncourt, complaining arbitrariness and also challenging the concerned eligibility criteria.\r\n5. The IIT which resisted the writ petition justified the impugned criterion, i.e. No.5, contending\r\nthat it was neither illegal nor unconstitutional and was based on sound public policy considerations.\r\nIt was argued that the JEE (Advanced) Information Brochure contained uniform criteria applicable\r\nto all candidates appearing for the competitive examination for admission to IITs. It was submitted\r\nthat the withdrawal option was so designed as to achieve two primary objectives, firstly, avoidance\r\nof wastage or blockage of seats and consequently to enable students to improve their performance in\r\nthe subsequent year and if eligible, to participate again. It was, therefore, argued that in the event\r\nthe candidate did not exercise an option and did not reject the seat already accepted, her or his\r\ncandidature would be precluded for the subsequent year for the reason that in the year that she did\r\nnot opt to continue in the course, it would not have been possible to fill up the seat for the rest of the\r\ncourse.\r\n6. It was further pointed out that conditions such as Criteria no.5 is in the public domain from\r\n06.03.2020, on the one hand and that similar provisions were consistently followed and applied for\r\nover five years. Pointing out that the JEE (Advanced) was conducted on 27.09.2020 involving six\r\nrounds of counselling which finally concluded on 07.11.2020 for IITs in accordance with the rules,\r\nthe IIT objected to the petitioner\u2019s conduct in waiting till the end of the entire process and then\r\napproaching the Court in third week of December 2020. Soutrik had argued that he could not\r\nwithdraw from the seat allocation (i.e. the admission to IIT Kharagpur) after the fifth round due to\r\ninadvertence. This submission was contested and the IIT alleged that he was estopped from so\r\ncontending.\r\n7. The learned Single Judge, by the impugned judgment, faulted the impugned criteria for\r\ndiscriminating against a successful candidate who secures a seat in one of the IITs and preventing\r\nher or him from competing in the subsequent examination whereas permitting candidates who\r\nsecure admissions in non-IIT institutions, to do so. It was reasoned that in either case, an available\r\nasset in the form of a seat in an engineering institution gets wasted \u2013 a logic which applies to both\r\nIITs and non-IIT institutions. The learned Single Judge also referred to those who withdrew their\r\ncandidature voluntarily. In 2020, there were 847 such candidates who did so because the seat was\r\nnot according to their liking or the subject combination was not in accordance with their wishes.\r\nSuch candidates were permitted to appear in the subsequent examination process. There was no\r\nprejudice or injustice caused to them. However, in cases, where the candidates did not opt to\r\nwithdraw their candidature after securing a seat, there is prejudice in the sense that they are not\r\nallowed to appear in a subsequent examination to test their merit and secure admission in better\r\nranking institute or in different sub-streams on the basis of rank based purely on their meritorious\r\nperformance. On the basis of this reasoning it was held that Soutrik was debarred from appearing in\r\nthe JEE for the second time only on the basis of being an IITian who was admitted in Chemistry in\r\nIIT Kharagpur but was desirous of studying in computer science.\r\nSubmissions of parties\r\n8. Mr. Sonal Jain, Advocate, appearing on behalf of the IIT urged that the High Court fell into error\r\nin holding that the impugned stipulation unfairly kept out candidates for admission to IITs. He\r\nemphasised that such a criterion has been in place for over five years and the High Court, by\r\ninterfering with it has disturbed a carefully designed admission program. It was highlighted that the\r\nadmission program criteria are evolved after careful deliberation to provide access to the\r\nparticipating institutions through admissions in an equitable and reasonable manner. Permitting\r\nsuccessful candidates to challenge and overreach the system with the speculative hope of improving\r\nthe performance despite securing admission and proceeding to abandon the seats offered to them\r\nafter foregoing the option to withdraw, would spell disaster and undermine the entire examination\r\nprocess; besides it would be contrary to public interest. It was highlighted further that permitting\r\nthe respondent to appear in the JEE (Advanced) for the subsequent examination would be\r\ninequitable given that the same pattern is uniformly accepted and applied across over 100\r\ninstitutions and accepted by over 2 lakh candidates, who had appeared in the examination process.\r\n9. It was urged that the High Court erred in law in equating IIT seats with non- IIT seats without\r\nappreciating that the statutory rules were not under challenge. Furthermore, the impugned criteria\r\noperates for the forthcoming year as well and not confined to 2021. As a consequence, a large\r\nnumber of candidates had already fixed their position by following the rules. Interfering with the\r\nprocess would irrevocably prejudice such candidates who had accepted its mandate. It was argued\r\nthat Soutrik, the respondent misled the High Court by suppressing material facts that he had never\r\nopted for computer science, contrary to his averments in the JEE (Mains) examination 2020 and\r\nfurthermore by deceit and withholding information that he had been admitted to a course in IIT\r\nKharagpur and proceeding to accept the seat in IIT Bombay (in BS Mathematics) based on his\r\nperformance in the International Olympiad.\r\n10. Mr. S.K. Bhattacharya, learned counsel for the respondent, Soutrik argued at the outset that the\r\nappeal should not be maintained for the reason that IIT has directly approached this Court without\r\navailing itself of the normal remedy of an appeal before the LPA Bench. It was emphasized that if the\r\nmatter were to be proceeded with, the respondent Soutrik would be placed at a disadvantage\r\nbecause he would have in the event of a decision by this court, no recourse to further appeal. Mr.\r\nBhattacharya underlined that even otherwise, this Court has, as a matter of practice, desisted from\r\nentertaining the appeals from the learned Single Judge\u2019s decisions, if appeals are available in the\r\nform of Letters Patents or writ appeals in the concerned High Courts.\r\n11. Mr. S.K. Bhattacharya, learned counsel urged that Criterion 5 is plainly discriminatory because it\r\ndifferentiates between candidates who are successful in securing admission to IITs and those who\r\nsecured admission to non-IIT institutions. Highlighting that both categories of candidates appear in\r\nthe same examination, it was emphasized that the so-called sub-categorisation is irrational. Echoing\r\nthe reasoning of the High Court, Mr. Bhattacharya urged that the IIT\u2019s grounds for framing such a\r\ndiscriminatory policy are faulty because whether it is the ITT or a non-IIT technical institution the\r\nconsequence of a candidate opting out of a particular course and seeking admission in a different\r\ninstitution would lead to the same consequence, i.e. loss of one seat. In the circumstances, it cannot\r\nbe said that there is a distinction between the two kinds of institutions.\r\n12. It was submitted that Soutrik opted for the seat in IIT Kharagpur but could not pull out of the\r\nadmission process before expiry of the last date for doing so due to inadvertence. In these\r\ncircumstances, he ought to be given the choice of appearing in the current JEE (Advanced)\r\nexamination since his career is at stake and he has an equal right to better his opportunity as\r\ncandidate who succeeds in securing admission in non-IIT institutions but do not opt to continue.\r\nAnalysis and reasoning\r\n13. At the outset, this Court holds as insubstantial the objection on behalf of the respondent, Soutrik\r\nthat the IIT should have approached the Division Bench in Letter Patent jurisdiction of the Calcutta\r\nHigh Court. The ordinary rule of necessity that litigants should approach and avail of appellate\r\nremedies exhausting them before approaching this Court is a rule of convenience and not an\r\nimmutable practice. It has been held to be so by this Court (Ref State of UP v Harish Chandra &\r\nOrs2). Moreover, the discretion under Article 136 of the Constitution is flexible and 1996 (9) SCC\r\n309 sufficiently wide, to correct glaring errors and injustices. Furthermore, this Court had issued\r\nnotice on 09.09.2021 and granted an interim order suspending the directions of the High Court. On\r\nthe two subsequent dates of hearing, i.e. 17.09.2021 and 24.09.2021, there was no objection on the\r\npart of the respondent with respect to the maintainability of the present petition. Having regard to\r\nall these facts, the objection is hereby overruled.\r\n14. Criterion no. 5, which is impugned in the present case, is part of the Information Brochure for\r\nthe JEE (Advanced), 2020 information brochure; it is reproduced below:\r\n\u201CCriterion 5 \u2013 Earlier admission at IITs: A candidate should NOT have been admitted\r\nin an IIT irrespective of whether or not he\/she continued in the program OR accepted\r\nan IIT seat by reporting at a reporting centre in the past. Candidates whose\r\nadmission at IITs was cancelled after joining any IIT are also NOT eligible to appear\r\nin JEE (Advanced) 2020.\r\nCandidates who have been admitted to a preparatory course in any of the IITs for the\r\nfirst time in 2019 can appear in JEE (Advanced) 2020.\r\nThe candidates who paid seat acceptance fee in 2019 but (i) did not report at any\r\nreporting centre OR, (ii) withdrew before the last round of seat allotment, OR, (iii)\r\nhad their seat cancelled (for whatever reason) before the last round of seat allotment\r\nfor IITs, during the joint seat allocation in 2019, are eligible to appear in JEE\r\n(Advanced) 2020.\r\nHowever, in all of the above cases, the candidate is also required to fulfil the\r\nconditions mentioned from Criterion 1 to Criterion 4.\u201D\r\n15. IITs are constituted under the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 (hereafter \u201Cthe Act\u201D) and are\r\ndeclared to be technical institutions of education, declared by Parliament, to be of national\r\nimportance (under Entry 64) of the Union List (List I) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of\r\nIndia3, set-up to foster excellence in education. The appellant contends that IITs have created a\r\nworld class academic platform dynamically sustained through quality teaching and internationally\r\nacclaimed research with excellent infrastructure and the best minds available. Admission to the IITs\r\nis governed by the JEE (Advanced) Information Brochure which sets out the detailed rules of\r\neligibility. That an examination is conducted exclusively by the IITs and the National Testing Agency\r\n(NTA) has no role in this. The NTA\u2019s role is confined only to the JEE (Mains). The top 2.5 lakh\r\nsuccessful candidates in the JEE (Mains) examination category wise \u2013 are allowed to appear in the\r\nJEE (Advanced) examination provided they fulfill other eligibility criteria. The admissions\r\nstandards for the IITs are prescribed by virtue of exercise of power under Section 33(2)(b) of the\r\nAct. The planning of the JEE (Advanced) and the admissions process to various IITs is conceived\r\nand supervised by the Joint Administrative Board consisting of Directors of IITs, Members of the\r\nJoint Implementation Committee, representatives of the Union Government, CBSE etc. The IIT has\r\nin its appeal referred to the Joint Seat Allocation Authority Business Rules. These rules, - applicable\r\nfor the year 2020-21 to the extent they are relevant are extracted below:\r\n\u201D64. Institutions for scientific or technical education financed by the Government of\r\nIndia wholly or in part and declared by Parliament by law to be institutions of\r\nnational importance.\u201D \u201CXXVII ELIGIBILITY TO APPEAR IN JEE (ADVANCED) IN\r\nSUBSEQUENT YEARS\r\n69. Candidates who reject their seat during the first five (5) rounds or withdraw from\r\nallocated seat, by completing all formalities specified herein, can appear for JEE\r\n(Advanced) 2021 provided they meet all other eligibility requirements.\r\n70. Candidates who accept the allocated seat in any IIT by reporting online but later\r\ndo not withdraw seat or accept the allocated seat by reporting at the admitting\r\ninstitute (in case seat is allocated in the last round), irrespective of whether theyattend classes or not, become ineligible for JEE (Advanced) in subsequent years.\u201D\r\n16. In the present case, the undoubted facts are that Soutrik was successful in the JEE 2020 (Mains)\r\nexamination and on the basis of his performance, was offered a set in the IIT Kharagpur. The merit\r\nlist of the JEE (Advanced) Exam 2020 was announced on 05.10.2020. During the period between\r\n06.10.2020 to 15.10.2020, candidates had to register and fill the choice of interest and course\r\nstrictly in their preferred hierarchy. The three-day period between 12.10.2020 and 14.10.2020 was\r\nset apart for mock seat allocation stage based on filled choices by the candidates for seat allocation.\r\nThe seat allocation Round one was completed on 17.10.2020 during which Soutrik was allotted his\r\nchoice no.14 on 19.10.2020; he deposited the seat acceptance fee to the Joint Seat Allocation\r\nauthority. The second round of seat allocation was taken up on 21.10.2020 and the subsequent\r\nrounds followed, culminating in the final round. Rounds 3 to 5 were completed on 26.10.2020,\r\n30.10.2020 and 03.11.2020 where the seat withdrawal and exit was allowed to all candidates on\r\nprevious allotment rounds, i.e. four different occasions. The final round of seat allocation was\r\nconducted on 07.11.2020. Soutrik had, in the meanwhile been offered B.S. (Mathematics) course in\r\nthe IIT Bombay through a separate admission process based on his performance in the Mathematics\r\nOlympiad. This was disclosed by him in the writ petition filed before the High Court. He seems to\r\nhave accepted that offer of admission. He however, did not withdraw the admission granted earlier\r\nas of the last date provided for it. It appears that he wrote to the ITT on 08.11.2020 alleging that he\r\ngot an offer letter from the IIT Bombay for lateral entry to BS (Mathematics) after the online date\r\nfor withdrawal had lapsed, demanding refund of his seat acceptance fee. He proceeded to accept the\r\nadmission granted to him in IIT Bombay on 09.11.2020.\r\n17. The IIT (appellant here) alleges that at the time of his admission, to the BS course in IIT\r\nBombay, Soutrik did not disclose that he had accepted the admission in IIT Kharagpur in Chemical\r\nEngineering. Thereafter, he pursued the BS (Mathematics) course. Strangely, on 20.11.2020, Soutrik\r\npaid the admission fee for IIT Kharagpur, got his documents verified, studiously maintaining silence\r\nabout the fact that from 09.11.2020, he was a student pursuing a BS (Mathematics) class from IIT\r\nBombay.\r\n18. The IIT\u2019s pleading before this Court revealed that on 09.11.2020, this Court had opposed the\r\ninterim order in a Civil Appeal.4 IIT alleges that inspired by the interim order granted by this Court,\r\nSoutrik approached the Calcutta High Court on 23.12.2020 and filed his writ petition without\r\nmaking appropriate disclosures about his securing admission in IIT Bombay and that at the time of\r\nsecuring such admission, suppressing information that he had secured admission in IIT Kharagpur.\r\n19. The reasoning of the High Court of Criterion 5 not permitting IIT students to participate in IIT\r\n(Advanced) for the second time being arbitrary, in the opinion of this Court is not supportable. This\r\nCourt has repeatedly emphasized that in matters such as devising admissions criteria or other issues\r\nengaging academic institutions, the courts\u2019 scrutiny in judicial review has to be careful and\r\ncircumspect. Unless shown to be plainly arbitrary or discriminatory, the court would defer to the\r\nwisdom of administrators in academic institutions who might devise policies in regard to curricular\r\nadmission process, career progression of their employees, matters of discipline or other general\r\nadministrative issues concerning the institution or Sidhant Batra v. Director IIT Bombay CA4029\/2020 university5. It was held by this court in All India Council for Technical Education v.\r\nSurinder Kumar Dhawan6 \u201C16. The courts are neither equipped nor have the academic or technical\r\nbackground to substitute themselves in place of statutory professional technical bodies and take\r\ndecisions in academic matters involving standards and quality of technical education. If the courts\r\nstart entertaining petitions from individual institutions or students to permit courses of their choice,\r\neither for their convenience or to alleviate hardship or to provide better opportunities, or because\r\nthey think that one course is equal to another, without realizing the repercussions on the field of\r\ntechnical education in general, it will lead to chaos in education and deterioration in standards of\r\neducation.\"\r\n20. Given this general reluctance of courts to substitute the views of academic and expert bodies, the\r\napproach of the High Court in proceeding straightaway to characterize the rationale given by the IIT\r\nin fashioning the Criteria No. 5 cannot be supported.\r\n21. This court is of opinion that the impugned judgement is in error in holding that the exclusion of\r\na candidate who secures admission but does not opt out of it and virtually abandons it as in the case\r\nof Soutrik from participating in the subsequent JEE (Advanced) examination is arbitrary. As\r\nrecounted earlier, criteria, including Criteria no.5 were devised after extensive consultations\r\nbetween all the See Basavaiah (Dr.) v. Dr. H.L. Ramesh & Ors (2010) 8 SCC 372 where it was\r\nobserved that it is \"..settled legal position that the courts have to show deference and consideration\r\nto the recommendation of an Expert Committee consisting of distinguished experts in the field. In\r\nthe instant case, experts had evaluated the qualification, experience and published work of the\r\nappellants and thereafter recommendations for their appointments were made. The Division Bench\r\nof the High Court ought not to have sat as an appellate court on the recommendations made by the\r\ncountry's leading experts\u2026\"\r\n(2009) 11 SCC 726 IITs and other officials of the Union Government as well as the\r\nCBSE. The High Court proceeded to facially compare IITs and non-IIT institutions\r\nand hold that candidates who are admitted to non-IIT institutions and who do not\r\nproceed in the institution and who are allowed to participate in the subsequent JEE\r\n(Advanced) amounts to hostile discrimination and those who secure admission but\r\ndo not proceed with the course in any given year.\r\n22. In this Court\u2019s opinion, given that the Criteria no.5 is a part of the information Brochure, settled\r\nas a condition of admission in terms of of JoSAA Rules of 2020 meant that all IITs had adopted a\r\nuniform criteria of not permitting candidates who were successful in a previous year but did not\r\npursue their course and did not opt out of taking another chance in the subsequent year. This was a\r\nbinding norm applicable to all IIT institutions. If one considers the fact that JEE (Advanced) is\r\ngoverned by rules framed under the Act, and regulations, the further detail that it permitted nonIIT candidates who were admitted in a previous year (but did not pursue their course nor withdrew\r\nthe option in a previous year) is logical. Such non-IIT institutions are not governed by the Act and\r\nregulations framed under it or even for that matter JoSAA Business Rules. Furthermore, in the\r\nopinion of this Court, securing a seat in any one of the 23 IITs stands on a different footing than\r\nsecuring a seat in non-IIT institution. This is not to in any manner undermine the worth oracademic curricula or ranking of such non-IIT institutions. The classification of IITs, on the one\r\nhand and non-IIT institutions on the other hand is warranted. This Court does not wish to\r\nemphasise this aspect further except to say that the classification is justified both statutorily and in\r\nterms of Parliamentary declaration that the Act was conceived as one meant to set-up institutions of\r\nexcellence having national status. This Court hold Criterion 5 to be valid, aimed at conserving a\r\nvaluable public resource, i.e. seats in IITs.\r\n23. For the above reasons, the impugned judgment and directions of the High Court are hereby set\r\naside; the writ petition of the respondent, is consequently dismissed. In the circumstances, there\r\nshall be no order on costs.\r\n........................................J. [UDAY UMESH LALIT] ........................................J. [S.

          "judgement":"SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.\r\n1. Indra Devi, the appellant, is the complainant in FIR No.80 dated 23.02.2011 registered under\r\nSections 420\/467\/468\/471\/120B of the IPC and Sections 3(1)(4)\/3(15)\/3(5) of the Scheduled Caste\r\n& Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act at P.S. Kotwali, Distt. Barmer. It was alleged that\r\nshe and her husband Bhanwar Lal purchased two plots in Khasra No.1179\/03 located in Distt.\r\nBarmer. Out of these two plots, one plot was sold to one Megharam while another plot was sold to\r\none Chetan Choudhary. In the plot purchased in the name of her husband, a residential house and\r\nshops are stated to have been made. Megharam is alleged to have tampered with and fabricated the\r\nagreement with the intention to defraud. This was allegedly done in collusion with the then\r\nexecutive officer of the Municipality, one Surender Kumar Mathur and \u201Cthe concerned clerk and\r\nothers\u201D, by enlarging the dimensions of the plot which have been sold to him with the intention to\r\ngrab the land and house occupied by the complainant and her husband. The Khasra number is also\r\nalleged to have been changed from 1179\/03 to 1143\/04. This fact is stated to have come to the notice\r\nof the complainant only when they were served with a court notice when they were in physical\r\npossession of the plot with the house and the shop. Her husband is stated to have gone to Jaipur for\r\ntreatment of cancer. The accused persons are, thus, alleged to have committed the offences of\r\nfraudulently making a scheduled caste women, her cancer diagnosed husband and other family\r\nmembers homeless. It may be noted that Respondent No.2 herein, Yogesh Acharya was not named\r\nin the FIR but, apparently, he is stated to be \u201Cthe concerned clerk\u201D.\r\n2. In pursuance of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed and charges were framed vide order\r\ndated 10.04.2012 against Megharam. Once again Respondent No.2 was not named in the\r\nchargesheet but a reference was made to Megharam acting in collusion with \u201Cco-accused persons\u201D.\r\n3. The records placed before us do not reflect how Respondent No.2 was exactly roped in, but suffice\r\nto say, Respondent No.2 moved an application under Section 197 of the CrPC before the trial court\r\nstating that he was a public servant and what he did in respect of allotment of lease, that was\r\nexecuted in favour of Megharam, was done during the course of his official duty and thus he was\r\nentitled to protection under the aforementioned provision. He also sought to assail the chargesheet\r\nas the same had been filed without obtaining sanction of the competent authority under Section 197\r\nof the CrPC.\r\n4. The trial court dismissed the application vide order dated 10.08.2017, while noticing that\r\nRespondent No.2 had not been mentioned in the FIR. It was opined that it was the duty of\r\nRespondent No.2 to bring irregularities to the knowledge of the competent officers, i.e. Megharam\r\nhad mentioned the wrong Khasra number in the lease but no documents of ownership of the land\r\nwere produced. The trial court was of the view that had the discrepancies been brought to the\r\nknowledge of the competent officers by Respondent No.2, the disputed lease would not have been\r\nissued. The result of the failure to do so caused the forged lease to be prepared. Respondent No.2\r\nhad also drafted the disputed lease in which he failed to mention necessary details. It was, thus,\r\nopined that Respondent No.2 was liable to be prosecuted against for having committed criminal\r\noffence to procure a forged lease. What Respondent No.2 did was held not to be done by the public\r\nservant in discharge of his official duty and thus protection under Section 197 of the CrPC would not\r\ncome to his aid.\r\n5. Respondent No.2 thereafter filed a Crl. Misc. Petition No.3138\/2017 under Section 482 of the\r\nCrPC before the High Court of Judicature at Jodhpur assailing the said order of the trial court. The\r\nHigh Court, vide impugned order dated 03.10.2017, allowed the petition. It was opined that the case\r\nwas similar to the one of Devi Dan v. State of Rajasthan1. The High Court had opined therein that\r\nsanction under Section 197 of the CrPC was required before triggering any prosecution against the\r\nStation House Officer for filing\/failing to file an FIR and for other criminal acts committed during\r\nthe discharge of his duties. The complainant, aggrieved by the said judgment, has approached this\r\ncourt by filing a special leave petition. The State has also filed an SLP. Leave was granted in both the\r\nmatters.\r\n6. The appellant contended before us that the involvement of Respondent No.2 only came to light\r\nduring investigation. He had failed to bring the irregularities to the knowledge of his superiors\r\nwhich was instrumental in issuing the forged lease. Thus, he had conspired with his superiors in\r\ndishonestly concealing the forgery, and intentionally omitting mentioning the date of the\r\nproceedings on the order sheet. Such action of forging documents would not be considered as an act\r\nconducted in the course of his official duties and, thus Section 197 of the CrPC would not give\r\nprotection to Respondent No.2.\r\n1 Crim. Misc. Pet. No.2177\/2013 decided on 10.10.2014\r\n7. On the other hand, Respondent No.2 endeavoured to support the impugned judgment of the High\r\nCourt by emphasising that in FIR only Megharam alongwith some unnamed officials were\r\nmentioned. Surender Kumar Mathur, the Executive Officer of the Nagar Palika, had filed a petition\r\nunder Section 482 of the CrPC relating to the same transaction and the High Court had granted him\r\nprotection under Section 197 of the CrPC vide order dated 22.02.2018. The conduct of putting his\r\ninitials was held to be an act done in discharge of his duties. Similarly, Sandeep Mathur, a Junior\r\nEngineer, who was part of the same transaction, was granted protection by the Sessions Court vide\r\norder dated 19.03.2020, once again under the same provision, i.e., Section 197 of the CrPC. Both the\r\norders remained unchallenged by the complainant and the State. Further, it has been argued that\r\nRespondent No.2 was simply carrying out his official duty which is apparent from the work allotted\r\nto him that pertained to allotment, regularisation, conversion of agricultural land and all kinds of\r\nwork relating to land and conversion. The application of Megharam was routed through the office,\r\nand the proceedings show that the file was initially put up before the Executive Officer, who directed\r\ninspection, which was carried out by the Junior Engineer. Thereafter, file was placed before the\r\nExecutive Officer again and only then was it signed by the Municipal Commissioner. The two key\r\npeople involved in the process had already been granted protection and thus Respondent No.2\r\nherein, who was merely a Lower Division Clerk, could not be denied similar protection.\r\n8. Learned counsel for Respondent relied upon the judgments of this Court in B. Saha & Ors. Vs.\r\nM.S. Kochar2 and State of Maharashtra Vs. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao3 to contend that Section 197 of\r\nthe CrPC ought to be read in a liberal sense for grant of protection to the public servant with respect\r\nto actions, which though constitute an offence, are \u201Cdirectly and reasonably\u201D connected with their\r\nofficial duties.\r\n9. We have given our thought to the submissions of learned counsel for the parties. Section 197 of\r\nthe CrPC seeks to protect an officer from unnecessary harassment, who is accused of an offence\r\ncommitted while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties and, thus,\r\nprohibits the court from taking cognisance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the\r\ncompetent authority. Public servants have been treated as a special category in order to protectthem from malicious or vexatious prosecution. At the same time, the shield cannot protect corrupt\r\nofficers and the provisions must be construed in such a manner as to advance the cause of honesty,\r\njustice and good governance. [See Subramanian Swamy Vs. Manmohan Singh4]. The alleged\r\nindulgence of the officers in cheating, fabrication of records or misappropriation cannot be said to\r\nbe in discharge of their official duty. However, such sanction is necessary if the offence alleged\r\nagainst the public servant is committed by him \u201Cwhile acting or purporting to act in the discharge of\r\nhis official duty\u201D and in order 2 (1979) 4 SCC 177 3 (1993) 3 SCC 339 4 (2012) 3 SCC 64 to find out\r\nwhether the alleged offence is committed \u201Cwhile acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his\r\nofficial duty\u201D, the yardstick to be followed is to form a prima facie view whether the act of omission\r\nfor which the accused was charged had a reasonable connection with the discharge of his duties.\r\n[See State of Maharashtra Vs. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao]5. The real question, therefore, is whether\r\nthe act committed is directly concerned with the official duty.\r\n10. We have to apply the aforesaid test to the facts of the present case. In that behalf, the factum of\r\nRespondent No.2 not being named in the FIR is not of much significance as the alleged role came to\r\nlight later on. However, what is of significance is the role assigned to him in the alleged infraction,\r\ni.e. conspiring with his superiors. What emerges therefrom is that insofar as the processing of the\r\npapers was concerned, Surendra Kumar Mathur, the Executive Officer, had put his initials to the\r\nrelevant papers which was held in discharge of his official duties. Not only that, Sandeep Mathur,\r\nwho was part of the alleged transaction, was also similarly granted protection. The work which was\r\nassigned to Respondent No.2 pertained to the subject matter of allotment, regularisation,\r\nconversion of agricultural land and fell within his domain of work. In the processing of application\r\nof Megharam, the file was initially put up to the Executive Officer who directed the inspection and\r\nthe inspection was carried out by the Junior Engineer and only thereafter the Municipal\r\nCommissioner signed the file. The result is that the superior 5 supra officers, who have dealt with\r\nthe file, have been granted protection while the clerk, who did the paper work, i.e. Respondent No.2,\r\nhas been denied similar protection by the trial court even though the allegation is of really\r\nconspiring with his superior officers. Neither the State nor the complainant appealed against the\r\nprotection granted under Section 197 of the CrPC qua these two other officers.\r\n11. We are, thus, not able to appreciate why a similar protection ought not to be granted to\r\nRespondent No.2 as was done in the case of the other two officials by the Trial Court and High Court\r\nrespectively. The sanction from competent authority would be required to take cognisance and no\r\nsanction had been obtained in respect of any of the officers. It is in view thereof that in respect of the\r\nother two officers, the proceedings were quashed and that is what the High Court has directed in the\r\npresent case as well.\r\n12. In view of the aforesaid, the appeals are dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own costs.\r\n\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

          "judgement":"1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned orders passed by the High Court of\r\nJudicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur allowing the applications under Section 11 of the Arbitration &\r\nConciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Act\u2019) and appointing an Arbitrator, Jaipur Zila\r\nDugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Ltd, Jaipur (hereinafter referred to as Sahkari Sangh) and others\r\nhave preferred the present Special Leave Petitions.\r\n2. For the sake of convenience, the facts in SLP (C) No.13520 of 2021 are narrated and SLP (C)\r\nNo.13520 of 2021 be treated as a lead matter.\r\n3. On 31.03.2015, the respondent herein and the Sahkari Sangh entered into Distributorship\r\nAgreement for the distribution of milk and butter milk in certain zones in Jaipur, which was for a\r\nperiod of two years. The dispute arose between the parties. Clause 13 of the distributorshipagreement provided for resolution of disputes. Clause 13 contains an arbitration clause and it\r\nprovides that all disputes and differences arising out of or in any way touching or concerning the\r\nagreement, whatsoever shall be referred to the sole Arbitrator, the Chairman, Jaipur Zila Dugdh\r\nUtpadak Sahkari Sangh Ltd. and his decision shall be final and binding for the parties. On\r\n18.08.2018, the respondent made representation pointing out his grievance\/dispute. Vide letter\r\ndated 22.08.2018, the respondent herein \u2013 original applicant was advised to raise dispute before the\r\nSole Arbitrator\/Chairman. That on 19.10.2019, the respondent firm\/original applicant approached\r\nthe Sole Arbitrator as per Clause 13 of the Agreement dated 31.03.2015 i.e. the Chairman, Jaipur\r\nZila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Ltd. for settlement of a commercial dispute between the parties.\r\nThat during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings before the Chairman \u2013 Sole Arbitrator, the\r\nrespondent herein \u2013 firm approached the High Court for appointment of an arbitrator in exercise of\r\npowers under Section 11 of the Act and invoking the arbitration contained in clause 13 of the\r\nAgreement dated 31.03.2015. The said application was opposed by the petitioners herein. It was\r\nsubmitted that once the respondent \u2013 firm approached the Chairman \u2013 Sole Arbitrator for resolving\r\nthe dispute between the parties invoking Clause 13 of the Agreement dated 31.03.2015 and having\r\nparticipated in the arbitration proceedings thereafter it is not open for it to approach the High Court\r\nto appoint an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Act. It was also submitted on behalf of the\r\npetitioners that the Agreement dated 31.03.2015 was prior to the amendment of Section\r\n12\/insertion of Section 12 (5) of the Act and the contract was entered into between the parties before\r\ninsertion of Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 by amendment of Act, 2015 read with Seventh Schedule to\r\nthe Act, Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act shall not be applicable\r\nand the Chairman continues to be the sole arbitrator as per Clause 13. That thereafter by the\r\nimpugned order and considering the Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to\r\nthe Act, the High Court has allowed the said application and has appointed the former District and\r\nSessions Judge to act as an arbitrator. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order\r\npassed by the High Court appointing a fresh Arbitrator in exercise of powers under Section 11 of the\r\nArbitration Act, Sahkari Sangh has preferred the present petitions.\r\n4. Shri Gunjan Pathak, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners has vehemently\r\nsubmitted that the High Court has materially erred in appointing the arbitrator other than the\r\narbitrator mentioned in Clause 13 of the Agreement dated 31.03.2015.\r\n4.1 It is submitted that first of all Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the\r\nAct shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand more particularly when the agreement\r\nbetween the parties was prior to insertion of Sub\u2212 section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh\r\nSchedule to the Act. It is further submitted that even otherwise the \u2018Chairman\u2019 being an elected\r\nmember shall not come within Seventh Schedule to the Act. It is submitted that \u2018Chairman\u2019 is not\r\nincluded within disqualified\/ineligible person to be appointed in Seventh Schedule of the Act.\r\n4.2 It is further submitted that the High Court has erred in relying upon Seventh Schedule to the Act\r\nof 2015 for the reason as the Learned Sole Arbitrator\/Chairman who is an elected member and is a\r\npart of management by virtue of election as a director or has no similar influence, can be said to be\r\ndisqualified as per the Clause (5) of Seventh Schedule of the Amendment Act, 20154.3 It is further submitted that even otherwise considering Section 58 of the Rajasthan Cooperative\r\nSocieties Act, 2001, the dispute between the parties was required to be resolved by the Registrar and\r\nthe decision of the Registrar shall be final. It is submitted that non\u2212obstante clause as contained in\r\nSection 58 of the Rajasthan Cooperative Societies Act, 2001 supersedes Sub\u2212section (5) of Section\r\n12 of the Amendment Act, 2015 and therefore no court of law shall have jurisdiction to entertain any\r\nsuit or proceeding in respect of such dispute. It is submitted that as per Clause 30 of the Bye Laws of\r\nSahkari Sangh all disputes of the society shall be dealt with as per Rajasthan Co\u2212 operative Societies\r\nAct, 2001. It is submitted that therefore also the impugned order passed by the High Court deserves\r\nto be quashed and set aside.\r\n4.4 It is further submitted that the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that as\r\nheld by this Court in the S.B.P. & Co vs Patel Engineering Ltd. & Anr., (2005) 8 SCC 618, once the\r\nmatter reaches the arbitration tribunal or the sole arbitrator, the High Court would not interfere\r\nwith the orders passed by the Arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal during the course of arbitral\r\nproceedings and the party aggrieved by any order of the arbitral tribunal, unless has a right of\r\nappeal under Section 37 of the Act, has to wait until the award is passed by the Tribunal. It is\r\nsubmitted therefore once the arbitral tribunal has initiated the proceedings, the High Court ought\r\nnot to have interfered in such matters. It is submitted that therefore, also the impugned order\r\npassed by the High Court appointing an arbitrator is unsustainable.\r\n5. We have heard Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners at length.\r\n6. It is not in dispute that distributorship agreement between the parties was dated 31.03.2015 i.e.\r\nprior to the insertion of Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 and Seventh Schedule to the Act w.e.f.\r\n23.10.2015. It also cannot be disputed that Clause 13 of the Agreement dated 31.03.2015 contained\r\nthe arbitration clause and as per Clause 13, any dispute and differences arising out of or in any way\r\ntouching or concerning distributorship agreement shall be resolved through arbitration. As per\r\nClause 13 such a dispute shall be referred to the sole Arbitrator \u2013 the Chairman, Sahkari Sangh.\r\n6.1 By the impugned order the High Court has allowed the application under Section 11 of the Act\r\nand has appointed the arbitrator other than the Chairman.\r\n6.2 The submissions of the petitioners are observed and narrated hereinabove.\r\n6.3 So far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners that the agreement was prior to the\r\ninsertion of Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act and therefore the\r\ndisqualification under Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act shall not\r\nbe applicable and that once an arbitrator \u2013 Chairman started the arbitration proceedings thereafter\r\nthe High Court is not justified in appointing an arbitrator are concerned the aforesaid has no\r\nsubstance and can to be accepted in view of the decision of this Court in Trf Ltd vs Energo\r\nEngineering Projects Ltd, (2017) 8 SCC 377; Bharat Broadband Network Limited vs United\r\nTelecoms Limited, (2019) 5 SCC 755; Voestalpine Schienen GMBH vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation\r\nLimited, (2017) 4 SCC 665. In the aforesaid decisions this Court had an occasion to consider in\r\ndetail the object and purpose of insertion of Sub\u2212 section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh\r\nSchedule to the Act. In the case of Voestalpine Schienen GMBH (Supra) it is observed and held by\r\nthis Court that the main purpose for amending the provision was to provide for \u2018neutrality of\r\narbitrators\u2019. It is further observed that in order to achieve this, Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 lays\r\ndown that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship with\r\nthe parties or counsel or the subject\u2212matter of the dispute falls under any of the categories specified\r\nin the Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. It is further observed\r\nthat in such an eventuality i.e. when the arbitration clause finds foul with the amended provisions\r\n(Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule) the appointment of an arbitrator would\r\nbe beyond pale of the arbitration agreement, empowering the court to appoint such arbitrator as\r\nmay be permissible. It is further observed that, that would be the effect of non obstante clause\r\ncontained in sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 and the other party cannot insist on appointment of the\r\narbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement.\r\n6.4 It is further observed and held by this Court in the aforesaid decision that independence and\r\nimpartiality of the arbitrator are the hallmarks of any arbitration proceedings. Rule against bias is\r\none of the fundamental principles of natural justice which apply to all judicial and quasi\u2212judicial\r\nproceedings. It is further observed that it is for this reason that notwithstanding the fact that\r\nrelationship between the parties, to the arbitration and the arbitrators themselves are contractual in\r\nnature and the source of an arbitrator\u2019s appointment is deduced from the agreement entered into\r\nbetween the parties, notwithstanding the same non\u2212independence and non\u2212 impartiality of such\r\narbitrator would render him ineligible to conduct the arbitration. It is further observed that the\r\ngenesis behind this rational is that even when an arbitrator is appointed in terms of contract and by\r\nthe parties to the contract, he is independent of the parties. In paragraphs 16 to 18 it is observed and\r\nheld as under:\r\n\u201C16. Apart from other amendments, Section 12 was also amended and the amended\r\nprovision has already been reproduced above. This amendment is also based on the\r\nrecommendation of the Law Commission which specifically dealt with the issue of\r\n'neutrality of arbitrators' and a discussion in this behalf is contained in paras 53 to 60\r\nand we would like to reproduce the entire discussion hereinbelow:\r\n\u201CNEUTRALITY OF ARBITRATORS\r\n53. It is universally accepted that any quasi\u2212 judicial process, including the\r\narbitration process, must be in accordance with principles of natural justice. In the\r\ncontext of arbitration, neutrality of arbitrators, viz. their independence and\r\nimpartiality, is critical to the entire process.\r\n54. In the Act, the test for neutrality is set out in Section 12(3) which provides \u2013 \u201812.\r\n(3) \u201CAn arbitrator may be challenged only if \u2013\r\n(a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or\r\nimpartiality...\u201D\r\n55. The Act does not lay down any other conditions to identify the \u201Ccircumstances\u201D\r\nwhich give rise to \u201Cjustifiable doubts\u201D, and it is clear that there can be many such\r\ncircumstances and situations. The test is not whether, given the circumstances, there\r\nis any actual bias for that is setting the bar too high; but, whether the circumstances\r\nin question give rise to any justifiable apprehensions of bias.\r\n56. The limits of this provision has been tested in the Indian Supreme Court in the\r\ncontext of contracts with State entities naming particular persons\/designations\r\n(associated with that entity) as a potential arbitrator. It appears to be settled by a\r\nseries of decisions of the Supreme Court (See Executive Engineer, Irrigation Division,\r\nPuri v. Gangaram Chhapolia, 1984 (3) SCC 627; Secretary to Government Transport\r\nDepartment, Madras v. Munusamy Mudaliar, 1988 (Supp) SCC 651; International\r\nAuthority of India v. K.D. Bali and Anr, 1988 (2) SCC 360; S. Rajan v. State of Kerala,\r\n1992 (3) SCC 608; M\/s. Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals v. M\/s. Indo\u2212Swiss\r\nSynthetics Germ Manufacturing Co.Ltd., 1996 (1) SCC 54; Union of India v. M.P.\r\nGupta, (2004) 10 SCC 504; Ace Pipeline Contract Pvt. Ltd. v. Bharat Petroleum\r\nCorporation Ltd., 2007 (5) SCC 304) that arbitration agreements in government\r\ncontracts which provide for arbitration by a serving employee of the department, are\r\nvalid and enforceable.\r\nWhile the Supreme Court, in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. v. Raja Transport (P) Ltd., 2009 8 SCC 520\r\ncarved out a minor exception in situations when the arbitrator \u201Cwas the controlling or dealing\r\nauthority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate (as contrasted from an\r\nofficer of an inferior rank in some other department) to the officer whose decision is the subject\r\nmatter of the dispute\u201D (SCC p. 533, para 34) and this exception was used by the Supreme Court in\r\nDenel (Proprietary) Ltd. v. Govt. of India, Ministry of Defence, AIR 2012 SC 817 and Bipromasz\r\nBipron Trading SA v. Bharat Electronics Ltd., (2012) 6 SCC 384, to appoint an independent\r\narbitrator under section 11, this is not enough.\r\n57. The balance between procedural fairness and binding nature of these contracts, appears to have\r\nbeen tilted in favour of the latter by the Supreme Court, and the Commission believes the present\r\nposition of law is far from 18 satisfactory. Since the principles of impartiality and independence\r\ncannot be discarded at any stage of the proceedings, specifically at the stage of constitution of the\r\narbitral tribunal, it would be incongruous to say that party autonomy can be exercised in complete\r\ndisregard of these principles \u2013 even if the same has been agreed prior to the disputes having arisen\r\nbetween the parties. There are certain minimum levels of independence and impartiality that should\r\nbe required of the arbitral process regardless of the parties\u2019 apparent agreement. A sensible law\r\ncannot, for instance, permit appointment of an arbitrator who is himself a party to the dispute, or\r\nwho is employed by (or similarly dependent on) one party, even if this is what the parties agreed.\r\nThe Commission hastens to add that Mr. PK Malhotra, the ex officio member of the Law\r\nCommission suggested having an exception for the State, and allow State parties to appoint\r\nemployee arbitrators. The Commission is of the opinion that, on this issue, there cannot be any\r\ndistinction between State and non\u2212State parties. The concept of party autonomy cannot be\r\nstretched to a point where it negates the very basis of having impartial and independent\r\nadjudicators for resolution of disputes. In fact, when the party appointing an adjudicator is the\r\nState, the duty to appoint an impartial and independent adjudicator is that much more onerous \u2013\r\nand the right to natural justice cannot be said to have been waived only on the basis of a \u201Cprior\u201D\r\nagreement between the parties at the time of the contract and before arising of the disputes.\r\n58. Large\u2212scale amendments have been suggested to address this fundamental issue of neutrality of\r\narbitrators, which the Commission believes is critical to the functioning of the arbitration process in\r\nIndia. In particular, amendments have been proposed to sections 11, 12 and 14 of the Act.\r\n59. The Commission has proposed the requirement of having specific disclosures by the arbitrator,\r\nat the stage of his *possible* appointment, regarding existence of any relationship or interest of any\r\nkind which is likely to give rise to justifiable doubts. The Commission has proposed the\r\nincorporation of the Fourth Schedule, which has drawn from the red and orange lists of the IBA\r\nGuidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration, and which would be treated as a\r\n\u201Cguide\u201D to determine whether circumstances exist which give rise to such justifiable doubts. On the\r\nother hand, in terms of the proposed section 12 (5) of the Act and the Fifth Schedule which\r\nincorporates the categories from the red list of the IBA Guidelines (as above), the person proposed\r\nto be appointed as an arbitrator shall be *ineligible* to be so appointed, notwithstanding any prior\r\nagreement to the contrary. In the event such an ineligible person is purported to be appointed as an\r\narbitrator, he shall be de jure deemed to be unable to perform his functions, in terms of the\r\nproposed explanation to section 14. Therefore, while the *disclosure* is required with respect to a\r\nbroader list of categories (as set out in the Fourth Schedule, and as based on the Red and Orange\r\nlists of the IBA Guidelines), the *ineligibility* to be appointed as an arbitrator (and the consequent\r\nde jure inability to so act) follows from a smaller and more serious sub\u2212set of situations (as set out\r\nin the Fifth Schedule, and as based on the Red list of the IBA Guidelines).\r\n60. The Commission, however, feels that *real* and *genuine* party autonomy must be respected,\r\nand, in certain situations, parties should be allowed to waive even the categories of ineligibility as set\r\nin the proposed Fifth Schedule. This could be in situations of family arbitrations or other\r\narbitrations where a person commands the blind faith and trust of the parties to the dispute, despite\r\nthe existence of objective \u201Cjustifiable doubts\u201D regarding his independence and impartiality. To deal\r\nwith such situations, the Commission has proposed the proviso to section 12 (5), where parties may,\r\nsubsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of the proposed section\r\n12 (5) by an express agreement in writing. In all other cases, the general rule in the proposed section\r\n12 (5) must be followed. In the event the High Court is approached in connection with appointment\r\nof an arbitrator, the Commission has proposed seeking the disclosure in terms of section 12 (1) and\r\nin which context the High Court or the designate is to have \u201Cdue regard\u201D to the contents of such\r\ndisclosure in appointing the arbitrator.\u201D (emphasis supplied)\r\n17. We may put a note of clarification here.\r\nThough, the Law Commission discussed the aforesaid aspect under the heading \u201CNeutrality of\r\nArbitrators\u201D, the focus of discussion was on impartiality and independence of the arbitrators which\r\nhas relation to or bias towards one of the parties. In the field of international arbitration, neutralityis generally related to the nationality of the arbitrator. In international sphere, the \u201Cappearance of\r\nneutrality\u201D is considered equally important, which means that an arbitrator is neutral if his\r\nnationality is different from that of the parties. However, that is not the aspect which is being\r\nconsidered and the term \u201Cneutrality\u201D used is relatable to impartiality and independence of the\r\narbitrators, without any bias towards any of the parties. In fact, the term \u201Cneutrality of arbitrators\u201D\r\nis commonly used in this context as well.\r\n18. Keeping in mind the aforequoted recommendation of the Law Commission, with which spirit,\r\nSection 12 has been amended by the Amendment Act, 2015, it is manifest that the main purpose for\r\namending the provision was to provide for neutrality of arbitrators. In order to achieve this, sub\u2212\r\nsection (5) of Section 12 lays down that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any\r\nperson whose relationship with the parties or counsel or the subject matter of the dispute falls under\r\nany of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to be appointed as an\r\narbitrator. In such an eventuality i.e. when the arbitration clause finds foul with the amended\r\nprovisions extracted above, the appointment of an arbitrator would be beyond pale of the arbitration\r\nagreement, empowering the court to appoint such arbitrator(s) as may be permissible. That would\r\nbe the effect of non obstante clause contained in sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 and the other party\r\ncannot insist on appointment of the arbitrator in terms of arbitration agreement.\u201D\r\n7. In the case of Bharat Broadband Network Limited (Supra), it is observed that Sub\u2212section (5) of\r\nSection 12 read with Seventh Schedule made it clear that if the arbitrator falls in any one of the\r\ncategories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he becomes \u2018ineligible\u2019 to act as an arbitrator. It is\r\nfurther observed that once he becomes \u2018ineligible\u2019, it is clear that he then become dejure unable to\r\nperform his functions inasmuch as in law, he is regarded as \u2018ineligible\u2019. It further is observed in the\r\nsaid decision that where a person becomes ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator there is no\r\nquestion of challenge to such arbitrator before such arbitrator in such a case i.e. a case which falls\r\nunder Section 14(1)(a) of the Act gets attracted inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of\r\nlaw (i.e., de jure), unable to perform his functions under Section12(5), being ineligible to be\r\nappointed as an arbitrator and this being so, his mandate automatically terminates, and he shall\r\nthen be substituted by another arbitrator.\r\n7.1 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners that in view of Section 58 of the\r\nRajasthan Cooperative Societies Act, 2001, the dispute between the parties is to be resolved by the\r\nRegistrar only and as per Bye Laws 30 of Rajasthan Cooperative Societies Act, 2001 shall be\r\napplicable and therefore no court shall have jurisdiction and therefore the dispute referred to the\r\nformer District Judge is unsustainable has no substance. It cannot be disputed that Arbitration Act\r\nis a special Act. Even Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 also states with non obstante clause. In the\r\ndistributorship agreement dated 31.03.2015, there is a provision to resolve dispute through\r\narbitration. Despite Section 58 of the Rajasthan Cooperative Societies Act, 2001, there is an\r\nagreement between the parties to resolve the dispute through arbitrator \u2013 Chairman. Parties are\r\nbound by the agreement and the arbitration clause contained in the Agreement dated 31.03.2015.\r\nTherefore, neither Section 58 of the Rajasthan Cooperative Societies Act, 2001 shall not be\r\napplicable at all nor the same shall come in the way of appointing the arbitrator under the\r\nArbitration Act.8. Now the next question which is required to consider is whether the Chairman who is an elected\r\nmember of the petitioner Sahkari Sangh can be said to be \u2018ineligible\u2019 under Sub\u2212section (5) of\r\nSection 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act or not. It is the case on behalf of the petitioner that\r\nin the Seventh Schedule to the Act \u2018Chairman\u2019 is not mentioned and only Manager, Director or part\r\nof the Management can be said to be ineligible. The aforesaid has no substance at all.\r\nDisqualification\/ineligible under Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the\r\nAct is to be read as a whole and considering the object and purpose for which Sub\u2212section (5) of\r\nSection 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act came to be inserted. Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12\r\nread with Seventh Schedule has been inserted bearing in mind the \u2018impartiality and independence\u2019\r\nof the arbitrators. It has been inserted with the purpose of \u2018neutrality of arbitrators\u2019. Independence\r\nand impartiality of the arbitrators are the hallmarks of any arbitration proceedings as observed in\r\nthe case of Voestalpine Schienen (Supra). Rule against bias is one of the fundamental principles of\r\nnatural justice which apply to all judicial proceedings and quasi\u2212judicial proceedings and it is for\r\nthis reason that despite the contractually agreed upon, the persons mentioned in Sub\u2212section (5) of\r\nSection 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act would render himself ineligible to conduct the\r\narbitration. In paragraphs 20 to 22 in the case of Voestalpine Schienen (Supra) it is observed and\r\nheld as under:\r\n\u201C20. Independence and impartiality of the arbitrator are the hallmarks of any\r\narbitration proceedings. Rule against bias is one of the fundamental principles of\r\nnatural justice which applied to all judicial and quasi judicial proceedings. It is for\r\nthis reason that notwithstanding the fact that relationship between the parties to the\r\narbitration and the arbitrators themselves are contractual in nature and the source of\r\nan arbitrator's appointment is deduced from the agreement entered into between the\r\nparties, notwithstanding the same non\u2212independence and non\u2212impartiality of such\r\narbitrator (though contractually agreed upon) would render him ineligible to conduct\r\nthe arbitration. The genesis behind this rational is that even when an arbitrator is\r\nappointed in terms of contract and by the parties to the contract, he is independent of\r\nthe parties. Functions and duties require him to rise above the partisan interest of the\r\nparties and not to act in, or so as to further, the particular interest of either parties.\r\nAfter all, the arbitrator has adjudicatory role to perform and, therefore, he must be\r\nindependent of parties as well as impartial. The United Kingdom Supreme Court has\r\nbeautifully highlighted this aspect in Hashwani v. Jivraj in the following words:\r\n(WLR p. 1889, para 45) \u201C45 .. ...the dominant purpose of appointing an arbitrator or\r\narbitrators is the impartial resolution of the dispute between the parties in\r\naccordance with the terms of the agreement and, although the contract between the\r\nparties and the arbitrators would be a contract for the provision of personal services,\r\nthey were not personal services under the direction of the parties.\u201D\r\n21. Similarly, Cour de Cassation, France, in a judgment delivered in 1972 in Consorts\r\nUry, underlined that:\r\n\u201Can independent mind is indispensable in the exercise of judicial power, whatever the\r\nsource of that power may be, and it is one of the essential qualities of an arbitrator.\u201D22. Independence and impartiality are two different concepts. An arbitrator may be\r\nindependent and yet, lack impartiality, or vice versa. Impartiality, as is well accepted,\r\nis a more subjective concept as compared to independence. Independence, which is\r\nmore an objective concept, may, thus, be more straightforwardly ascertained by the\r\nparties at the outset of the arbitration proceedings in light of the circumstances\r\ndisclosed by the arbitrator, while partiality will more likely surface during the\r\narbitration proceedings.\u201D\r\n9. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions and considering the object and\r\npurpose of insertion of Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act, the\r\nChairman of the petitioner Sangh can certainly be held to be \u2018ineligible\u2019 to continue as an arbitrator.\r\nThough in the Seventh Schedule the word \u2018Chairman\u2019 is specifically not mentioned but at the same\r\ntime it would fall in the category of Clause 1; Clause 2; Clause 5; Clause 12 which read as under:\r\n\u201C1. The arbitrator is an employee, consultant, advisor or has any other past or present\r\nbusiness relationship with a party.\r\n2. The arbitrator currently represents or advises one of the parties or an affiliate of\r\none of the parties.\r\n5. The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the management, or has a similar\r\ncontrolling influence, in an affiliate of one of the parties if the affiliate is directly\r\ninvolved in the matters in dispute in the arbitration.\r\n12. The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the management, or has a similar\r\ncontrolling influence in one of the parties.\u201D 9.1 In that view of the matter, the\r\nChairman who is elected member\/Director of the Sangh, can certainly be said to be\r\n\u2018ineligible\u2019 to become an arbitrator as per Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with\r\nSeventh Schedule to the Act.\r\n10. Now so far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners that the respondents\r\nparticipated in the arbitration proceedings before the sole arbitrator \u2013 Chairman and\r\ntherefore he ought not to have approached the High Court for appointment of\r\narbitrator under Section 11 is concerned, the same has also no substance.\r\nAs held by this Court in the case of Bharat Broadband Network Limited (Supra) there must be an\r\n\u2018express agreement\u2019 in writing to satisfy the requirements of Section 12(5) proviso. In paragraphs 15\r\n& 20 it is observed and held as under:\r\n\u201C15. Section 12(5), on the other hand, is a new provision which relates to the de jure\r\ninability of an arbitrator to act as such. Under this provision, any prior agreement to\r\nthe contrary is wiped out by the non\u2212 obstante clause in Section 12(5) the moment\r\nany person whose relationship with the parties or the counsel or the subject matter of\r\nthe dispute falls under the Seventh Schedule. The sub\u2212section then declares that suchperson shall be \u201Cineligible\u201D to be appointed as arbitrator. The only way in which this\r\nineligibility can be removed is by the proviso, which again is a special provision which\r\nstates that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive\r\nthe applicability of Section 12(5) by an express agreement in writing. What is clear,\r\ntherefore, is that where, under any agreement between the parties, a person falls\r\nwithin any of the categories set out in the Seventh Schedule, he is, as a matter of law,\r\nineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can\r\nbe removed, again, in law, is that parties may after disputes have arisen between\r\nthem, waive the applicability of this sub\u2212section by an \u201Cexpress agreement in\r\nwriting\u201D. Obviously, the \u201Cexpress agreement in writing\u201D has reference to a person who\r\nis interdicted by the Seventh Schedule, but who is stated by parties (after the disputes\r\nhave arisen between them) to be a person in whom they have faith notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that such person is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule.\r\nxxx xxx xxx\r\n20. This then brings us to the applicability of the proviso to Section 12(5) on the facts\r\nof this case. Unlike Section 4 of the Act which deals with deemed waiver of the right\r\nto object by conduct, the proviso to Section 12(5) will only apply if subsequent to\r\ndisputes having arisen between the parties, the parties waive the applicability of sub\u2212\r\nsection (5) of Section 12 by an express agreement in writing. For this reason, the\r\nargument based on the analogy of Section 7 of the Act must also be rejected. Section 7\r\ndeals with arbitration agreements that must be in writing, and then explains that\r\nsuch agreements may be contained in documents which provide a record of such\r\nagreements. On the other hand, Section 12(5) refers to an \u201Cexpress agreement in\r\nwriting\u201D. The expression \u201Cexpress agreement in writing\u201D refers to an agreement made\r\nin words as opposed to an agreement which is to be inferred by conduct.\r\nHere, Section 9 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 becomes important. It states:\r\n\u201C9. Promises, express and implied.\u2014In so far as a proposal or acceptance of any\r\npromise is made in words, the promise is said to be express. In so far as such\r\nproposal or acceptance is made otherwise than in words, the promise is said to be\r\nimplied.\u201D It is thus necessary that there be an \u201Cexpress\u201D agreement in writing.\r\nThis agreement must be an agreement by which both parties, with full knowledge of\r\nthe fact that Shri Khan is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, still go ahead and\r\nsay that they have full faith and confidence in him to continue as such. The facts of\r\nthe present case disclose no such express agreement. The appointment letter which is\r\nrelied upon by the High Court as indicating an express agreement on the facts of the\r\ncase is dated 17.01.2017. On this date, the Managing Director of the appellant was\r\ncertainly not aware that Shri Khan could not be appointed by him as Section 12(5)\r\nread with the Seventh Schedule only went to the invalidity of the appointment of the\r\nManaging Director himself as an arbitrator. Shri Khan\u2019s invalid appointment onlybecame clear after the declaration of the law by the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd.\r\n(supra) which, as we have seen hereinabove, was only on 03.07.2017. After this date,\r\nfar from there being an express agreement between the parties as to the validity of\r\nShri Khan\u2019s appointment, the appellant filed an application on 07.10.2017 before the\r\nsole arbitrator, bringing the arbitrator\u2019s attention to the judgment in TRF Ltd.\r\n(supra) and asking him to declare that he has become de jure incapable of acting as\r\nan arbitrator. Equally, the fact that a statement of claim may have been filed before\r\nthe arbitrator, would not mean that there is an express agreement in words which\r\nwould make it clear that both parties wish Shri Khan to continue as arbitrator despite\r\nbeing ineligible to act as such. This being the case, the impugned judgment is not\r\ncorrect when it applies Section 4, Section 7, Section 12(4), Section 13(2), and Section\r\n16(2) of the Act to the facts of the present case, and goes on to state that the appellant\r\ncannot be allowed to raise the issue of eligibility of an arbitrator, having itself\r\nappointed the arbitrator. The judgment under appeal is also in correct in stating that\r\nthere is an express waiver in writing from the fact that an appointment letter has\r\nbeen issued by the appellant, and a statement of claim has been filed by the\r\nrespondent before the arbitrator. The moment the appellant came to know that Shri\r\nKhan\u2019s appointment itself would be invalid, it filed an application before the sole\r\narbitrator for termination of his mandate.\u201D\r\n11. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above once the sole arbitrator \u2013\r\nChairman is \u2018ineligible\u2019 to act as an arbitrator to resolve the dispute between the\r\nparties in view of Sub\u2212section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act\r\nhe loses mandate to continue as a sole arbitrator. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\r\nHigh Court has committed any error in appointing the arbitrator other than the sole\r\narbitrator \u2013 Chairman as per Clause 13 of the Agreement in exercise of powers, under\r\nSection 11 read with Section 14 of the Act.\r\n12. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above all these applications\r\ndeserve to be dismissed.\r\nThe special leave petitions are dismissed accordingly.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

          "judgement":"VIKRAM NATH, J.\r\n1. By means of this appeal, the appellant Jaswant Singh has prayed for quashing of the order dated\r\n06.02.2020 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in\r\nCRM-M-32011 of 2018 (O&M) whereby the High Court declined to exercise its powers under Section\r\n482 of the Criminal Procedure Code 1 to quash the criminal proceedings arising out of FIR No. 179\r\ndated 29.10.2009 under Section 406\/420 of the Indian Penal Code 2 , Police Station Fatehgarh\r\nSahib, District Fatehgarh Sahib. However, the High Court granted bail to the appellant subject to\r\ncertain conditions contained in the said order. The factual matrix giving rise to the present appeal is\r\nnarrated hereunder:\r\n2. Respondent no.2 Nasib Singh (the Complainant) moved an application dated 18.08.2009\r\naddressed to the Senior Superintendent of Police, District Fatehgarh Sahib stating therein that he\r\nwas known to one Gurmeet Singh, who was in the business of sending people 1 Cr.P.C.\r\n2 I.P.C.\r\nabroad. Gurmeet Singh had assured the Complainant that his two acquaintances Jaswant Singh and\r\nGurpreet Singh who were already settled in Italy, would help his son to get a job and settle in Italy.\r\nFor the aforesaid arrangement, Gurmeet Singh demanded a total amount of Rs 7 lacs. Further,\r\naccording to the Complainant, Rs 4 lacs was paid in cash on 10.12.2008 and thereafter Rs. 2 lacs\r\nwere paid by way of a cheque dated 18.02.2009 of the Punjab National Bank, Branch AS College,\r\nKhanna in favour of Gurmeet Singh which amount has since been credited in the account of\r\nGurmeet Singh. Soon thereafter Sarpreet Singh, son of the Complainant, was put on a flight to Italyon 19.02.2009. Further allegation is that Jaswant Singh and Gurpreet Singh did not honour their\r\npromise and harassed his son. They did not arrange for a job as per their promise. The documents\r\nwere misplaced by them and ultimately his son had to return after three\/four months. The\r\ncomplaint further alleges that the named accused further demanded Rs. 3 lacs and also threatened\r\nof dire consequences in case the money was not paid. That his son was mentally upset and he has\r\nalso spent huge amount in travelling and treatment of his son. It is thus prayed that appropriate\r\naction be taken and justice be done to the Complainant.\r\n3. The said complaint was inquired into by the ASI Manjit Singh of the Economic Offences Wing,\r\nFatehgarh Sahib. In the inquiry, the statements of the Complainant, his son and Gurmeet Singh\r\nwere recorded. Further Jaswant Singh and Gurpreet Singh, who were settled abroad and named in\r\nthe complaint, were also called upon to submit their statements which they have forwarded through\r\ne-mail. The Inquiry Officer did not find the case so as to make out any offence of cheating or breach\r\nof trust and, accordingly, recommended that the application be consigned by order dated\r\n04.09.2009.\r\n4. The in-charge, Economic Offences Wing, Shri Gurdeep Singh, also examined the material and the\r\nevidence on record and concurred with the recommendation made by the ASI on 04.09.2009. The\r\nDeputy Superintendent of Police, Bassi Pathana, Shri Rajwinder Singh also recommended that there\r\nis no need of any action on the application and the same may be consigned. However, the Senior\r\nSuperintendent of Police Shri Kostav Sharma, directed the Station House Officer to register a first\r\ninformation report and accordingly an FIR was registered on 29.10.2009. The matter was further\r\ninvestigated and a police report under Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. was submitted with the finding\r\nthat a triable case was made out only against Gurmeet Singh, and as against the other two named\r\naccused Jaswant Singh and Gurpreet Singh, as there was no evidence of any offence, they were\r\nexonerated.\r\n5. In the meantime, an additional statement of the complainant Nasib Singh was recorded on\r\n20.05.2010 in which also he clearly stated that he had paid the amount to Gurmeet Singh, Rs. 4 lacs\r\nin cash and Rs. 2 lacs by cheque.\r\n6. Based on the police report and the material enclosed with it, the Magistrate First Class at\r\nFatehgarh Sahib took cognizance and registered the Case No CHI\/0600029\/2010. During the trial\r\nthe prosecution moved an application on 11.06.2013 purported to be under Section 319 Cr.P.C.\r\npraying for summoning the appellant and the other co-accused Gurpreet Singh to face trial under\r\nSection 420 I.P.C. On the same day the Trial Court summoned both the accused under Section 420\r\nI.P.C. As the appellant was in Italy, he did not appear and accordingly was declared as a proclaimed\r\noffender on 28.04.2014. The appellant filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High\r\nCourt in September, 2018 for quashing of the order dated 28.04.2014 declaring him as a proclaimed\r\noffender.\r\n7. In the meantime, the complainant Nasib Singh entered into a compromise with the main accused\r\nGurmeet Singh and they jointly applied before the Trial Court. The Trial Court, vide order dated\r\n26.09.2014 allowed the parties to amicably resolve their issue being of economic import andaccordingly compounded the offence. Proceedings were eliminated against the accused Gurmeet\r\nSingh.\r\n8. The High Court, vide interim order dated 10.09.2018, stayed the order of the Trial Court dated\r\n28.04.2014 and further directed the appellant to surrender before the Trial Court within two weeks\r\nand on his doing so the Trial Court was directed to release him on interim bail subject to its\r\nsatisfaction. The appellant thereafter appeared before the Trial Court on 27.10.2018 whereafter the\r\nTrial Court admitted him to interim bail on his furnishing bail bonds and surety bonds and in the\r\nsum of Rs.1 lac.\r\n9. In the pending 482 Cr.P.C. petition before the High Court, the appellant filed another application\r\nregistered as CRM No 4655\/2020 wherein he prayed for quashing of the proceedings on various\r\ngrounds and in particular that the complainant had already settled his score with the main accused\r\nGurmeet Singh and on their joint request the Trial Court had already eliminated\/ acquitted Gurmeet\r\nSingh of the offence.\r\n10. The High Court vide order dated 10.01.2020 permitted to place on record the order granting\r\ninterim bail and also the order of compounding\/acquittal of the co-accused and any other material\r\nwhich the appellant may wish to file. All the relevant material was filed by the appellant before the\r\nHigh Court by way of an application dated 04.02.2020.\r\n11. The High Court, vide the impugned judgment, declined to quash the proceedings on the ground\r\nthat a perusal of the FIR goes to show that the name of the appellant is specifically mentioned in the\r\nFIR and criminal acts have been attributed to him. However, the High Court with respect to the\r\norder dated 28.04.2014 declared the appellant to be a proclaimed offender and directed him to\r\nsurrender before the Trial Court within two weeks and to move an application for a regular bail,\r\nwhich was to be decided within two weeks subject to three conditions. It would be worthwhile to\r\nreproduce the order of the High Court, which reads as follows:\r\n\u201CBy way of filing the present petition, petitioner Jaswant Singh, a non resident Indian\r\nseeks quashing of F.I.R.No.179 dated 29.10.2009 under Sections 406\/420 IPC\r\nregistered at Police Station Fatehgarh Sahib, District Fatehgarh Sahib. I have gone\r\nthrough the F.I.R. A perusal thereof goes to show that name of petitioner is\r\nspecifically mentioned in the F.I.R. and criminal acts have been attributed to him.\r\nTherefore, no ground is there to quash the F.I.R., as such request in that regard is\r\ndeclined. With regard to order dated 28.4.2014 vide which he has been declared a\r\nproclaimed offender, he is directed to surrender in the trial Court within two weeks.\r\nOn his doing so and moving application for regular bail, the same be decided within\r\ntwo weeks. Till then he may not be arrested. This order is subject to the following\r\nconditions:-\r\ni) The petitioner shall surrender his Passport in the trial Court.\r\nii) The petitioner shall appear in the trial Court on each and every date of hearing.iii) The petitioner shall not give any threat or intimidation to the prosecution\r\nwitnesses.\r\nThe petition is disposed of.\u201D\r\n12. When this matter came up before us on 24.09.2021, we had issued notice and further provided\r\nthat no coercive steps be taken against the appellant.\r\n13. We have heard Shri Lakhwinder Singh Mann, learned counsel for the appellant and Shri\r\nJaspreet Singh Gogia, learned counsel for the respondent.\r\n14. In our view, the present one is amongst those fittest cases where the High Court ought to have\r\nexercised its powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and ought to have secured the ends of justice by\r\nclosing the proceedings against the appellants. It is also surprising as to how and in what\r\ncircumstances after moving an application under Section 319 Cr.P.C., the prosecution continued to\r\ncontest the case even after 26.09.2014 when the matter had already been compromised and\r\ncompounded as against the main accused Gurmeet Singh. Apparently, the parties were not able to\r\ncorrectly place the facts and material before the Trial Court or the High Court, which could have\r\nclosed this matter then and there without proceeding any further.\r\n15. The power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is to be exercised to prevent the abuse of process of any\r\nCourt and also to secure the ends of justice. This Court, time and again, has laid emphasis that\r\ninherent powers should be exercised in a given and deserving case where the Court is satisfied that\r\nexercise of such power would either prevent abuse of such power or such exercise would result in\r\nsecuring the ends of justice. In the case of S.W. Palanitkar and others. v. State of Bihar and another\r\n3. Shivraj V Patil, J., in paragraph 27 of the report, has laid similar emphasis. The same is\r\nreproduced below:\r\n\u201CPara 27:\r\n\u2026\u2026.whereas while exercising power under Section 482 CrPC the High Court has to\r\nlook at the object and purpose for which such power is conferred on it under the said\r\nprovision. Exercise of inherent power is available to the High Court to give effect to\r\nany order under CrPC, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to\r\nsecure the ends of justice. This being the position, exercise of power under Section\r\n482 CrPC should be consistent with the scope and ambit of the same in the light of\r\nthe decisions aforementioned. In appropriate cases, to prevent judicial process from\r\nbeing an instrument of oppression or harassment in the hands of frustrated or\r\nvindictive litigants, exercise of 3 (2002) 1 SCC 241 inherent power is not only\r\ndesirable but necessary also, so that the judicial forum of court may not be allowed to\r\nbe utilized for any oblique motive. When a person approaches the High Court under\r\nSection 482 CrPC to quash the very issue of process, the High Court on the facts and\r\ncircumstances of a case has to exercise the powers with circumspection as stated\r\nabove to really serve the purpose and object for which they are conferred.\u201D\r\n16. A seven-Judge Bench in the case of P. Ramachandra Rao vs State of Karnataka 4, also laid down\r\nthe same principles for use of the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. in a case where the Court was\r\nconvinced that such exercise was necessary for whatever reason in order to prevent abuse of the\r\nprocess of any Court or to secure the ends of justice. Lahoti,J., speaking for him- self and Bharucha,\r\nQuadri, Santosh Hegde, Ruma Pal and Arijit Pasayat,JJ., observed as follows in paragraph 21:\r\n\u201CPara 21. \u201C\u2026 In appropriate cases, inherent power of the High Court, under Section\r\n482 can be invoked to make such orders, as may be necessary, to give effect to any\r\norder under the Code of Criminal Procedure or to prevent abuse of the process of any\r\ncourt, or otherwise, to secure the ends of justice. The power is wide and, if judiciously\r\nand consciously exercised, can take care of almost all the situations where\r\ninterference by the High Court becomes necessary on account of delay in proceedings\r\nor for any other reason amounting to oppression or harassment in any trial, inquiry\r\nor proceedings. In appropriate cases, the High Courts have exercised their\r\njurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC for quashing of first information report and\r\ninvestigation, and terminating criminal proceedings if the case of abuse of process of\r\nlaw was clearly made out. Such power can certainly be exercised on a case being\r\nmade out of breach of fundamental right conferred by Article 21 of the Constitution.\r\nThe Constitution Bench in A.R. Antulay case referred to such power, vesting in the\r\nHigh Court (vide paras 62 and 65 of its judgment) and held that it was clear that even\r\napart from Article 21, the courts can take care of undue or inordinate delays in\r\ncriminal matters or proceedings if they remain pending for too long and putting an\r\nend, by making appropriate orders, to further proceedings when they are found to be\r\noppressive and unwarranted.\u201D\u201D 4 (2002) 4 SCC 578\r\n17. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Gian Singh vs State of Punjab 5 again summarized the legal\r\nposition which emerged regarding powers of the High Court in quashing criminal pro- ceedings in\r\nexercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. R.M. Lodha, J., (as he then was) speaking for the\r\nBench, clearly observed in paragraph 61 of the report that criminal cases hav - ing overwhelmingly\r\nand predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the pur- poses of quashing,\r\nparticularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such\r\nlike transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family\r\ndisputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved\r\ntheir entire dispute. The relevant extract from paragraph 61 is reproduced below:\r\n\u201C61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised thus:\r\nthe power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint\r\nin exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to\r\na criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.\r\nInherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be\r\nexercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to secure the\r\nends of justice, or (in) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In what cases\r\npower to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where\r\nthe offender and the victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts andcircumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before\r\nexercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and\r\ngravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences\r\nlike murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or\r\nvictim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not\r\nprivate in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise\r\nbetween the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under special statutes\r\nlike the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants\r\nwhile working in that capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing\r\ncriminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having\r\noverwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the\r\npurposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,\r\nmercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\r\nmatrimony relating to dowry, 5 (2012) 10 SCC 303 etc. or the family disputes where\r\nthe wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved\r\ntheir entire dispute. In this category of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal\r\nproceedings if in its View, because of the compromise between the offender and the\r\nvictim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the\r\ncriminal case would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme\r\ninjustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and\r\ncomplete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court\r\nmust consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to\r\ncontinue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding\r\nwould tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise\r\nbetween the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is\r\nappropriate that the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above\r\nquestion(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to\r\nquash the criminal proceeding.\u201D\r\n18. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Parbatbhai Aahir Alias Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur\r\nand others v. State Gujarat and others 6 laid down the broad principles for exercising the inherent\r\npowers of the High Court under section 482 Cr.P.C. Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud,J., speaking for the\r\nbench, enumerated the principles in paragraph 16 and in sub paragraphs. The same are reproduced\r\nbelow:\r\n\u201C16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be\r\nsummarised in the following propositions:\r\n16.1. Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an\r\nabuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does\r\nnot confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the\r\nHigh Court16.2. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a first information\r\nreport or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at\r\nbetween the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction\r\nfor the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the\r\npower of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if\r\nthe offence is non-compoundable.\r\n16.3. In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be\r\nquashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must\r\nevaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power.\r\n16.4. While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and 6 (2017) 9\r\nSCC 641 plenitude it has to be exercised (0) to secure the ends of justice, or ) to\r\nprevent an abuse of the process of any court.\r\n16.5. The decision as to whether a complaint or first information report should be\r\nquashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves\r\nultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration\r\nof principles can be formulated. 16.6. In the exercise of the power under Section 482\r\nand while dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High Court must\r\nhave due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious\r\noffences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity\r\ncannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of the victim have\r\nsettled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a\r\nserious impact upon society. The decision to continue with the trial in such cases is\r\nfounded on the overriding element of public interest in punishing persons for serious\r\noffences. 16.7. distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which\r\nhave an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute.\r\nThey stand on a distinct footing insofar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned.\r\n16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial, mercantile,\r\npartnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate situations fall\r\nfor quashing where parties have settled the dispute.\r\n16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise\r\nbetween the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal\r\nproceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and 16.10. There is yet an exception to the\r\nprinciple set out in propositions 16.8, and 16.9. above. Economic offences involving the financial\r\nand economic well-being of the State have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere\r\ndispute between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where\r\nthe offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The\r\nconsequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in thebalance.\u201D\r\n19. From the above discussion on the settled legal principles, it is clear from the facts of the present\r\ncase that there was a clear abuse of the process of the Court and further that the Court had a duty to\r\nsecure the ends of justice. We say so for the following reasons:\r\na) The allegations made in the FIR had an overwhelmingly and predominatingly a\r\ncivil flavour inasmuch as the complainant alleged that he had paid money to Gurmeet\r\nSingh, the main accused to get employment for his son abroad. If Gurmeet Singh\r\nfailed the complainant could have filed a suit for recovery of the amount paid for not\r\nfulfilling the promise.\r\nb) Initially, the investigating officer and two superior officers of the economic wing\r\nhas found that there is no substance in the complaint making out even a prima facie\r\ntriable case and had therefore, recommended for closure. However, on the orders of\r\nthe Senior Superintendent of Police, the FIR was registered and the matter was\r\ninvestigated. No criminal breach of trust was found and the charge sheet was\r\nsubmitted only against Gurmeet Singh under section 420 I.P.C.\r\nc) The complainant Nasib Singh had clearly deposed that he had paid Rs 4 lacs cash\r\nto Gurmeet Singh and had also given a cheque of Rs 2 lacs favouring Gurmeet Singh\r\nwhich he had encashed.\r\nd) During trial the present appellant as also the other co-accused Gurpreet Singh\r\nwere summoned in April 2014 invoking powers of Section 319 Cr.P.C., for being tried\r\nunder Section 420 I.P.C. It may be noted that no specific allegations of cheating are\r\nmade against these two accused as they were both settled abroad in Italy.\r\ne) The complainant Nasib Singh entered into a compromise with the main accused\r\nGurmeet Singh which was filed before the learned Magistrate and the same was\r\naccepted vide order dated 26.09.2014 and the alleged offence being of financial\r\ntransaction stood compounded. Proceedings against Gurmeet Singh were closed.\r\nf) Right from 2014, the present appellant and other co-accused Gurpreet Singh who\r\nwere in Italy were being summoned by the Court. The appellant was declared\r\nproclaimed offender. The appellant applied before the High Court challenging the\r\norder declaring him proclaimed offender and also filed a 482 Cr.P.C. petition for\r\nquashing of the proceedings wherein, he also filed the compounding order of\r\n26.09.2014.\r\ng) The High Court merely perused the FIR and noting the fact that the name of the\r\nappellant was mentioned in the FIR, declined to exercise the inherent power under\r\nSection 482 Cr.P.C.\r\n20. In our considered view, the High Court erred in firstly not considering the entire material on\r\nrecord and further in not appreciating the fact that the dispute, if any, was civil in nature and that\r\nthe complainant had already settled his score with the main accused Gurmeet Singh against whom\r\nthe proceedings have been closed as far back as 26.09.2014. In this scenario, there remains no\r\njustification to continue with the proceedings against the appellant.\r\n21. For all the reasons recorded above on facts and on law both the present appeals deserve to be\r\nallowed. The impugned proceedings arising out of FIR No.179 dated 29.10.2009, PS Fatehgarh\r\nSahib and all consequential proceedings stand quashed qua the appellant.\r\n\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...............................J.

          "judgement":"1 Leave granted.\r\n 2 The High Court of Telangana, by its interim orders dated 5 Octo2021 and 26 October 2021, has held that the action of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University1\r\nin seeking the approval of the State Government before granting affiliation to new courses in\r\nexisting institutions, which have already been approved by All India Council for Technical\r\nEducation2, is contrary to the decision of this Court in Jaya Gokul Education Trust v Commissioner\r\n& Secretary to Govt Higher Education Department, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala State and\r\nAnother3. Date: 2021.11.23 Consequently, the High Court has, directed JNTU to notify theinstitutions in the 1 \u201CJNTU\u201D 2 \u201CAICTE\u201D 3 (2000) 5 SCC 231 course of the second phase of\r\ncounselling thereby allowing students to be admitted to the courses. Several institutions sought the\r\npermission of AICTE, inter alia, for enhancing the intake capacity in \u201Cemerging areas\u201D of\r\nengineering or, as the case may be, for new courses. The approval of AICTE was granted. 3 JNTU\r\naddressed a communication on 8 September 2021 to the Commissioner for Technical Education\r\nseeking the approval of the State Government for granting affiliation to new courses\/increase in\r\nintake in the Under Graduate4 courses for 2021-\r\n22. The communication noted, however, that the final affiliation for the new seats\/increase in seats\r\nwould be subject to fulfillment of infrastructure and qualified faculty verified by the JNTU Fact\r\nFinding Committee.\r\n4 On 11 September 2021, the Commissioner of Technical Education addressed a communication to\r\nthe Secretary, Higher Education (TE) Department requesting the Government to examine the\r\nrequest of the institutions for the proposed introduction of new courses\/variation in the intake of\r\nthe existing engineering colleges which had offered UG level courses from 2021-22.\r\n5 A batch of petitions was instituted before the High Court in which the principal ground of\r\nchallenge was that once AICTE had granted its approval, it was not open to the affiliating University\r\nto predicate the grant of its affiliation on the issuance of an NOC by the State Government. This\r\nsubmission weighed with the High Court while passing the interim orders. The High Court was of\r\nthe view that the decision of this Court in Jaya Gokul Education Trust (supra) would support the\r\ncontention of the institutions. Hence, it issued the interim directions which have been noted earlier.\r\nThe interim orders of the High Court have been called into question by JNTU. 4 \u201CUG\u201D 6 Mr C S\r\nVaidyanathan, Senior Counsel has appeared on behalf of JNTU, while Mr S Niranjan Reddy, Senior\r\nCounsel, has appeared on behalf of the institutions. 7 The submission which has been urged on\r\nbehalf of JNTU is that the regulations of JNTU expressly contemplate a role for the State\r\nGovernment and the purpose of seeking an NOC of the State is to ensure that it can duly consider\r\nthe needs of the area concerned and whether the proposed course or, as the case may be, additional\r\nintake, would be consistent with the overall policy of the State. Moreover, it was urged that the\r\ndecision of this Court in Jaya Gokul Education Trust (supra) has been subsequently considered in\r\nseveral decisions and has been distinguished. The importance of the role of the State, it has been\r\nemphasized, has been underscored in subsequent decisions of this Court, including in the case of\r\nJNTU itself. In this backdrop, it is urged that it was not appropriate for the High Court to issue an\r\ninterim direction for counselling of students, particularly when neither the NOC of the State\r\nGovernment had been granted nor the process of affiliation was completed. The decisions on which\r\nreliance has been placed by Mr C S Vaidyanathan would be considered in the course of the\r\ndiscussion. 8 On the other hand, Mr S Niranjan Reddy, learned senior counsel urged that the\r\nchallenge which was addressed before the High Court was predicated on the insistence of JNTU that\r\nit must receive the NOC of the State Government before it proceeds with the process of affiliation.\r\nThe learned Senior Counsel submitted that the institutions do not dispute the statutory authority of\r\nJNTU to conduct the affiliation process, but once approval was granted by AICTE, JNTU\u2019s further\r\nrecourse to the State Government for its NOC would be contrary to the Central legislation by which\r\nAICTE is governed.\r\n9 At the outset, it is necessary to advert to the provisions of the Regulations governing JNTU.\r\nRegulations 5.5, 5.6 and 6.1 have a crucial bearing on the controversy and are, hence, extracted\r\nbelow:\r\n\u201C5.5 The existing College \/ Institute after obtaining approval\/awaiting approval from\r\nAICTE, has to obtain the requisite permission from the State Government. Later, the\r\nCollege \/ Institute can apply for affiliation to the University on or before the cut-off\r\ndate prescribed by the University through online application for the academic year\r\nannually. No application for grant of affiliation will be considered after the cut-off\r\ndate. However, the Grant of Affiliation by the University is subjected to approval\r\nfrom AICTE \/ PCI \/ State Government as the case may be.\r\n5.6 The permission for establishing Colleges and starting of new programs in the\r\nexisting Colleges shall be considered by the University as per the priority\/ policy of\r\nthe State Government if any. Hence, the College \/ Institute shall obtain prior\r\npermission from the State Government to start a new Program \/ College.\r\n6.1 The applications for issue of NOC for Increase in Intake\/ Closure of Course or\r\nCollege\/Institution \/ Change of Name \/ Change of Site\/Location or any other matter\r\nwhere University NOC is required shall be accompanied by the resolution from\r\nSociety \/ Management. Further, for starting a new Course \/ Increase in intake \/\r\nChange of Site\/Location of the existing College\/Institute, prior permission from the\r\nState Government is mandatory.\u201D\r\n10 Regulation 5.5 expressly embodies the requirement of the permission of the State Government\r\nafter an existing college or institution has obtained the approval or, as the case may be, is awaiting\r\nthe approval of the AICTE. Later, the institution can apply for affiliation by JNTU on or before the\r\ncut-off date. Regulation 5.6 stipulates that the permission for establishing colleges and starting of\r\nnew programmes in existing colleges would be considered by JNTU in accordance with the\r\npriority\/policy of the State Government and, hence, the prior permission of the State Government is\r\nrequired. Likewise, Regulation 6.1 makes it mandatory to obtain the prior permission of the State\r\nGovernment either to start a new course or, for that matter, to increase the intake capacity of an\r\nexisting course. 11 The role of the State Government has been reiterated in several decisions of this\r\nCourt. At the present stage, it is material to cite two of those decisions. Significantly, as we shall\r\nnote, the earlier decision in Jaya Gokul Education Trust (supra), upon which reliance was placed by\r\nthe High Court has also been considered in that context.\r\n12 In Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Registrar v Sangam Laxmi Bai Vidyapeet and\r\nOthers5, a two-Judge Bench of this Court considered the provisions of Section 20 of the Telangana\r\nEducation Act 1982 under which permission is required, inter alia, for opening new courses. In that\r\ncontext, the Court observed:\r\n\u201C14. A bare reading of the aforesaid provisions of section 20(1) makes it clear that the\r\nsurvey is conducted so as to identify the educational needs of the locality woulddefinitely include within its ken how many institutions are operating in the area and\r\nwhether there is any further requirement of opening educational institutions\/new\r\ncourses in existing colleges, and it is also imperative under section 20(3)(a)(i) that\r\neducational agency has to satisfy the authority that there is a need for providing\r\neducational facilities to the people in the locality. In case there are already a large\r\nnumber of institutions imparting education in the area the competent authority may\r\nbe justified not to grant the NOC, for permitting an institution to come up in the area.\r\n15. The provisions contained in section 20 are wholesome and intend not only to\r\ncater to the educational needs of the area but also prevent the mushroom growth of\r\nthe institutions\/courses. In case institutions are permitted to run each and every\r\ncourse that may affect the very standard of education and may ultimately result in\r\nsubstandard education. There is already a paucity of well qualified teachers in a large\r\nnumber of institutions and the available seats in Pharmacy course in the Hyderabad\r\ncity are remaining vacant every year in spite of the reduction in a number of seats. It\r\nhad not been 10 possible to fill up the available vacancies due to nonavailability of\r\nstudents. Thus, it is apparent that when 30 institutions in Hyderabad city are 5\r\n(2019) 17 SCC 729 already running Pharmacy course, the refusal to grant NOC by the\r\nUniversity was wholly justified.\r\n16. Apart from the provisions contained in section 20, when we consider Regulations\r\n5.2 and 5.3 which clearly provide that a new college proposing to offer technical\r\neducation with the University affiliation shall first seek a NOC from the University\r\nbefore applying to AICTE\/PCI\/any other statutory body. Regulation 5.3 provides that\r\nthe permission for starting of new programmes in the existing colleges shall be\r\nconsidered by the University as per the priority\/policy of the State Government if\r\nany.\u201D On the basis of the above analysis, the Court held that it was erroneous for the\r\nHigh Court to hold that it was not permissible for the State Government to frame a\r\npolicy and that JNTU was bound to issue its NOC.\r\n13 A more recent decision is a judgment of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in A P J Abdul Kalam\r\nTechnological University and Another v Jai Bharath College of Management and Engineering\r\nTechnology and Others6. In that decision, the importance of the role which is played by the State\r\nand by the affiliating University has again been emphasized and it has been noted that it would be\r\nopen to the State Government to even prescribe standards higher than those recognized by AICTE.\r\nAdverting to the decision in Jaya Gokul Education Trust (supra), it has been noted that it has been\r\ndistinguished subsequently. The Court noted that after the advent of the AICTE Regulations,\r\napplications for extension of approval are processed online on the basis of self-disclosure. Hence, it\r\nis all the more necessary for the Universities to conduct the process of affiliation with scrupulous\r\ncare in order to ensure that the interest of students is not imperilled. 14 In this backdrop, at the\r\npoint of time when the High Court passed its interim orders, neither had the State granted its NOC\r\nnor had JNTU granted affiliation. During the pendency of the proceedings, the Higher Education\r\n(TE) Department of the 6 (2021) 2 SCC 564 Government of Telangana has granted its NOC on 1\r\nNovember 2021. The process of affiliation is yet to be completed by JNTU. In this backdrop, theHigh Court ought not to have issued an interim direction so as to allow the institutions concerned to\r\nparticipate in the second round of counselling. Issuing such a judicial fiat even before the process\r\ncontemplated by the Regulations is complete is likely to prejudice the students, often, in an\r\nirretrievable manner, in the event that the affiliation is eventually denied. Experience indicates that\r\nthe creation of equities in favour of students leads to serious issues subsequently, when the interim\r\norders of the High Court lead to the admission of the students to an institution which may\r\neventually be denied affiliation. The interim direction cannot be sustained. 15 Since the State\r\nGovernment has granted its NOC, JNTU has indicated in its submissions, a willingness to conduct\r\nthe process of affiliation. Mr C S Vaidynathan stated that JNTU will conduct the process of\r\naffiliation within a period of ten days. 16 Once the process of affiliation is complete, the High Court\r\ncan be duly apprised of the result, in relation to each institution which has applied for permission.\r\nMeantime, the interim order would remain stayed, to abide by the final result of the affiliation\r\nprocess.\r\n17 We accordingly dispose of the appeals in terms of the following directions:\r\n(i) Since the State of Telangana has granted its NOC on 1 November 2021, JNTU shall\r\ncomplete the process of affiliation strictly in accordance with its Regulations within a\r\nperiod of ten days;\r\n(ii) After JNTU completes the process of affiliation, after due verification and\r\ninspection of the infrastructure and other facilities available at the institutions\r\nconcerned, an affidavit shall be filed before the High Court of Telangana indicating\r\nthe outcome of the process;\r\n(iii) Until the steps indicated in (ii) above are complete, the interim direction of the\r\nHigh Court shall continue to remain stayed; and\r\n(iv) Depending upon the outcome of the process of affiliation, the High Court would\r\nbe at liberty to take up the matter and issue such further directions as may be deemed\r\nnecessary.\r\n18 We clarify that this court has not issued any mandate or direction for breaching the time lines\r\nwhich have been prescribed by AICTE for completion of the process of approval, affiliation and\r\nadmissions. All the requirements of AICTE in regard to the last date for the completion of\r\nadmissions shall be duly complied with. 19 We leave it open to the High Court to pass appropriate\r\norders in the case of each institution based on the decision of the affiliating University. After the\r\ndecision of the University is communicated, the High Court may take an appropriate decision in\r\nregard to the compliant institutions.\r\n20 Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.\r\n\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026...\u2026.......\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026........J.

          "judgement":"Hrishikesh Roy, J.\r\n1. Heard Mr. A. Karthik, learned counsel for the appellant (claimant). Mr. JPN Shahi, learned\r\ncounsel appears for the insurance company (respondent no1).\r\n2. Leave granted. This appeal arises out of a motor accident claim following the serious injuries\r\nsuffered by the appellant on 13.4.2001 when the motor cycle (where the appellant was riding\r\npillion), was hit by a car. Both riders were impacted, resulting in severe head injuries to the\r\nappellant. He was bedridden, totally immobilized and initially, remained admitted in the hospital\r\nfor 191 days. The appellant has also suffered severe impairment of cognitive power with hemiparesis\r\nand total aphasiaand the prognosis for him is 69%permanent disability.\r\n3. The claim filed by the pillion riding appellant was analogously considered with other\r\nclaimantsfrom the same accident,by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Thrissur (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as, \u2018the Tribunal\u2019 for short).The Presiding Officer noticed that the severely impaired\r\npillion rider needed support of two persons,holding him from either side and because of his\r\ndiminished cognitive facilities, the claimant appeared to be oblivious to his surroundings before the\r\nTribunal. He could only partially close his mouth and consequently saliva dribbled from his mouth.\r\nThe Tribunal judge noted that the claimant was 21 years old and was earning around Rs.4,500\/- permonth from jewellery work when he suffered the accident. Considering these factors and applying\r\nthe multiplier of 17, the payable compensation for the pillion riderwas determined as Rs.5,74,320\/-\r\nby the Tribunal.\r\n4. Dissatisfied with the awarded sum, the claimant moved the High Court of Kerala for higher\r\ncompensation. With court\u2019s permission, the claimant produced three discharge summaries, 40\r\nmedical bills (totalling Rs.68,196\/-) and 3 medical reports issued by the hospital where the partially\r\ndisabled claimant received further treatment.Those were consideredtogether with the fact that Rs.\r\n4,500\/- p.m. was the earning of the claimant as a jewellery worker for which, 40% as future prospect\r\nneeded to be added.The additional medical expenses incurred for furthertreatment after the initial\r\n191 days of hospitalization was taken into account and,towards future treatment,Rs.1,00,000\/- was\r\nadded. The nature of permanent disability of 69% was then factored in under the relevant head and\r\nthe High Court quantified a higher sum ofRs.9,38,952\/- (instead of Rs.2,81,520\/-) as\r\ncompensation.Thusadditional compensation for permanent disability to the tune of Rs.8,57,432\/-\r\nwas quantified by the High Court, beyond the Rs.5,74,320\/- determined by the Tribunal for the\r\npillion rider.\r\n5. The chart below would indicate the compensation quantified by the Tribunal and the High Court,\r\nunder different heads:\r\n Head Tribunal High Court\r\n Loss of earning 12,000\/- 12,000\/-\r\n Expense for transportation 10,000\/- 10,000\/-\r\n Extra-nourishment 10,000\/- 10,000\/-\r\n Damage to clothing 500\/- 500\/-\r\n Expenses for treatment 1,40,300\/- 1,40,300\/-\r\n Expense for bystander 50,000\/- 50,000\/-\r\n Compensation for pain and 50,000\/- 1,00,000\/-\r\n suffering\r\n Compensation for permanent 2,81,500\/- 9,38,952\/-\r\n disability\r\n Loss for loss of amenities 20,000\/- 70,000\/-\r\n Future medical expenses NIL 1,00,000\/-\r\n Total 5,74,320\/- 14,31,752\/-\r\n6. The learned counsel Mr. A. Karthik for the\r\nappellant underscores that the claimant has suffered 69% permanent disability and is unable to\r\nperform everyday activities and he requires constant support even for the confined life that he is\r\nleading. Accordingly earnest plea is made for adding expenses for service of bystander\/attendant for\r\nthe severely impaired claimant.\r\n6.1 Since additional recurring medical exigencies are necessitated and expenses are incurred for\r\nregularmedical treatment even after the accident, based upon the bills and hospital documents\r\nproduced before the High Court, the appellant\u2019s counsel argues for substantial enhancement of thesum awarded under the head of future medical expenses.\r\n6.2 Becausethe appellant\u2019searning capacity is reduced to zero, (notwithstanding his 69% permanent\r\ndisability), the logic of restricting the compensation to 69% under the head of permanent disabilityis\r\nquestioned and Mr. Karthik, the learned counsel submits that the correct figure should be reached\r\nby treating it as 100% loss of future earnings.\r\n6.3 Considering the fact that the injured appellant was hospitalized for 191 days and was off work,\r\nthe lower quantification of his six months loss of earning at Rs.12,000\/-, when income is accepted as\r\nRs. 4500\/-, is questioned by the appellant\u2019s counsel and he argues that the loss of earning should be\r\nquantified at Rs.27,000\/- (instead of Rs.12,000\/-,) under the relevant head.\r\n7. On the other hand, Mr. JPN Shahi, the learned counsel appearing for the Insurance Company\r\nsubmits that when 69% percent permanent disability is suffered, the sum quantified by the High\r\nCourt at 69% level, requires no enhancement.\r\n7.1 It is further pointed out by the learned counsel that the High Court has already awarded\r\nRs.1,00,000\/- towards future medical expenses and the appellant is disentitled to claim any further\r\nsum on the said count. 7.2 Insofar as the claim for expenses for a bystander\/attendant, the learned\r\ncounsel submits that no material is produced by the claimant on the actualexpenses incurred for\r\nservice of attendant and accordingly it is argued that no further claim is merited under this head.\r\n8. As earlier noted, the appellant has suffered 69%permanent disability and without assistance,\r\ncannot perform everyday functions. The claimant with seriously impaired cognitive and physical\r\ncapabilities would surely need full time assistance even for the confined life that he is leading. In\r\nsuch circumstances, the disabled claimant cannot be expected to rely only upon gratuitous services\r\nof his well- wishers and family members. Importantly, thepresiding judge in the Tribunal himself\r\nnoticed that the claimant would require the assistance of a bystander\/attendant for all his\r\nmovements. Consequently, bearing in mind the need for assisted living and what was said in Kajal\r\nvs. Jagdish Chand and Others1, it is found necessary to addthe expenses for service of an attendant\r\nfor the claimant. Since no material is produced to quantify the expenses for the attendant,making a\r\nconservativeestimate, Rs.5,000\/- per month appears to be thebareminimum. It is therefore deemed\r\nappropriate to quantify the annual expenses at Rs.60,000\/- and applying the multiplier of 18, the\r\nadditional compensation payable under the bystander head is quantified at Rs.10,80,000\/-.\r\n9. The appellant has produced adequate medical documents before the High Court to show the\r\nrecurring needs for testing, treatment and further hospitalisation for which, considerable expenses\r\nwere incurred even after the initial 191 days of hospitalization. As a person suffering severe cognitive\r\nimpairment and 69% disability, recurring medical treatment is inevitable and bearing in mind\r\ntheadditional expenses already incurred, we deem it 1(2020) 4 SCC 413 appropriate to enhance the\r\nfuture medical expenses to Rs.3,00,000\/- (from Rs.1,00,000\/-), since the sum quantified by the\r\nHigh Court appears to be on the lower side.\r\n10.While the permanent disability as certified by the doctors stands at 69%,the same by no means,\r\nadequately reflects the travails the impaired claimant will have to face all his life. The 21 year old\u2019s\r\nyouthful dreams and future hopes were snuffedout by the serious accident. The young man\u2019s\r\nimpaired condition has certainly impacted his family members. Their resources and strength are\r\nbound to be stressed by the need to provide full time care to the claimant. For the appellant to\r\nconstantly rely on them for stimulation and support is destined to cause emotional, physical and\r\nfinancial fatigue for all stakeholders.\r\n11. The Motor Vehicles Act is in the nature of social welfare legislation and its provisions make it\r\nclear that the compensation should be justlydetermined. Justice A.P. Misra in Helen C. Rebello and\r\nOthers v. Maharashtra SRTC and Anr.2, held the following on the contours of \u2018just\u2019 compensation,\r\n\u201CThe word \u201Cjust\u201D, as its nomenclature, denotes equitability, fairness and reasonableness having a\r\nlarge peripheral field. The largeness is, of course, not arbitrary; it is restricted by the conscience\r\nwhich is fair, reasonable and equitable, if it exceeds; it is termed as unfair, unreasonable,\r\nunequitable, not just.\u201D A person therefore is not only to be compensated for the injury suffered due\r\nto the accident but also for the loss suffered on account of the injury and his inability to lead the life\r\nhe led, prior to the life- altering event. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud speaking for a three judges\u2019 bench\r\nin Jagdish Vs. Mohan and others3 makes the following relevant observation on the intrinsic value of\r\nhuman life and dignity that is attempted to be recognised, through such compensatory awards,\r\n\u201C\u2026the measure of compensation must reflect a genuine attempt of the law to restore the dignity\r\n2(1999) 1 SCC 90 3(2018) 4 SCC 571 of the being. Our yardsticks of compensation should not be so\r\nabysmal as to lead one to question whether our law values human life. If it does, as it must, it must\r\nprovide a realistic recompense for the pain of loss and the trauma of suffering. Awards of\r\ncompensation are not law's doles. In a discourse of rights, they constitute entitlements under law.\u201D\r\n12. The Courts should strive to provide a realistic recompense having regard to the realities of life,\r\nboth in terms of assessment of the extent of disabilities and its impact including the income\r\ngenerating capacity of the claimant. In cases of similar nature, wherein the claimant is suffering\r\nsevere cognitive dysfunction and restricted mobility, the Courts should be mindful of the fact that\r\neven though the physical disability is assessed at 69%, the functional disability is 100% in so far as\r\nclaimant\u2019s loss of earning capacity is concerned.\r\n13. The extent of economic loss arising from a disability may not be measured in proportions to the\r\nextent of permanent disability. This aspect was noticed in Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar and Anr.4,\r\nwhere Justice R.V. Raveendran made the following apt observations:\r\n\u201C10. Where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as a result of injuries, the\r\nassessment of compensation under the head of loss of future earnings would depend\r\nupon the effect and impact of such permanent disability on his earning capacity. The\r\nTribunal should not mechanically apply the percentage of permanent disability as the\r\npercentage of economic loss or loss of earning capacity. In most of the cases, the\r\npercentage of economic loss, that is, the percentage of loss of earning capacity,\r\narising from a permanent disability will be different from the percentage of\r\npermanent disability. Some Tribunals wrongly assume that in all cases, a particular\r\nextent (percentage) of permanent disability would result in a corresponding loss of\r\nearning capacity, and consequently, if the evidence produced shows 45% as the\r\npermanent disability, will hold that there is 45% loss of future earning capacity. In\r\nmost of the cases, equating the extent (percentage) of loss of earning capacity to the\r\nextent (percentage) of permanent disability will result in award of either too low or\r\ntoo high a compensation.\r\n11. What requires to be assessed by the Tribunal is the effect of the permanent\r\ndisability on the earning capacity of the injured; and after assessing the loss of\r\nearning capacity in terms of a percentage of the income, it has to be quantified in\r\nterms of money, to arrive at the future loss of earnings (by applying the standard\r\nmultiplier method used to determine loss of dependency). We may however note that\r\nin some cases, on appreciation of evidence and assessment, the Tribunal may find\r\nthat the percentage of loss 4(2011)1 SCC 343 of earning capacity as a result of the\r\npermanent disability, is approximately the same as the percentage of permanent\r\ndisability in which case, of course, the Tribunal will adopt the said percentage for\r\ndetermination of compensation.\u201D\r\n14. The test for determining the effect of permanent disability on future earning capacity involves\r\nthe following 3 steps as was laid down in Raj Kumar5 and reiterated by Justice Indu Malhotra in\r\nChanappa Nagappa Muchalagoda vs.Divisional Manager, New India Insurance Company Limited6.\r\n\u201C13. Ascertainment of the effect of the permanent disability on the actual earning capacity involves\r\nthree steps. The Tribunal has to first ascertain what activities the claimant could carry on in spite of\r\nthe permanent disability and what he could not do as a result of the permanent disability (this is\r\nalso relevant for awarding compensation under the head of loss of amenities of life). The second step\r\nis to ascertain his avocation, profession and nature of work before the accident, as also his age. The\r\nthird step is to find out whether (i) the claimant is totally disabled from earning any kind of\r\nlivelihood, or\r\n(ii) whether in spite of the permanent disability, the claimant could still effectively carry on the\r\nactivities and functions, which he was earlier carrying on, or (iii) whether he was prevented or\r\nrestricted from discharging his previous activities and functions, but could carry on some other or\r\nlesser scale of activities and functions 5Ibid 6(2020)1 SCC 796 so that he continues to earn or can\r\ncontinue to earn his livelihood.\u201D\r\n15. The above yardstick to be adopted in such exigencies was reaffirmed by Justice S. Ravindra Bhat\r\nin Pappu Deo Yadav vs. Naresh Kumar and others7. The following was set out by the three Judges\u2019\r\nBench:\r\n\u201C13. The factual narrative discloses that the appellant, a 20-year-old data entry\r\noperator (who had studied up to 12th standard) incurred permanent disability, i.e.\r\nloss of his right hand (which was amputated). The disability was assessed to be 89%.\r\nHowever, the tribunal and the High Court re- assessed the disability to be only 45%,\r\non the assumption that the assessment for compensation was to be on a different\r\nbasis, as the injury entailed loss of only one arm. This approach, in the opinion of this\r\ncourt, is completely mechanical and entirely ignores realities. Whilst it is true that\r\nassessment of injury of one limb or to one part may not entail permanent injury to\r\nthe whole body, the inquiry which the court has to conduct is the resultant loss which\r\nthe injury entails to the earning or income generating capacity of the claimant. Thus,\r\nloss of one leg to someone carrying on a vocation such as driving or something that\r\nentails walking or constant mobility, results in severe income generating impairment\r\nor its extinguishment altogether. Likewise, for one involved in a job like a carpenter\r\nor hairdresser, or machinist, and an experienced one at that, loss of an arm, (more so\r\na functional arm) leads to near extinction of income generation. If the age of the\r\nvictim is beyond 40, the scope of rehabilitation too diminishes. These individual\r\nfactors are of 7(2020) SCC Online 752 crucial importance which are to be borne in\r\nmind while determining the extent of permanent disablement, for the purpose of\r\nassessment of loss of earning capacity.\u201D \u201C20. Courts should not adopt a stereotypical\r\nor myopic approach, but instead, view the matter taking into account the realities of\r\nlife, both in the assessment of the extent of disabilities, and compensation under\r\nvarious heads. In the present case, the loss of an arm, in the opinion of the court,\r\nresulted in severe income earning impairment upon the appellant. As a typist\/data\r\nentry operator, full functioning of his hands was essential to his livelihood. The\r\nextent of his permanent disablement was assessed at 89%; however, the High Court\r\nhalved it to 45% on an entirely wrong application of some \u2018proportionate\u2019 principle,\r\nwhich was illogical and is unsupportable in law. What is to be seen, as emphasized by\r\ndecision after decision, is the impact of the injury upon the income generating\r\ncapacity of the victim. The loss of a limb (a leg or arm) and its severity on that\r\naccount is to be judged in relation to the profession, vocation or business of the\r\nvictim; there cannot be a blind arithmetic formula for ready application. On an\r\noverview of the principles outlined in the previous decisions, it is apparent that the\r\nincome generating capacity of the appellant was undoubtedly severely affected.\r\nMaybe, it is not to the extent of 89%, given that he still has the use of one arm, is\r\nyoung and as yet, hopefully training (and rehabilitating) himself adequately for some\r\nother calling. Nevertheless, the assessment of disability cannot be 45%; it is assessed\r\nat 65% in the circumstances of this case.\u201D\r\n16. As noted earlier, the impact on the earning capacity for the claimant by virtue of his 69%\r\ndisability must notbe measured as a proportionate loss of his earning capacity. The earning life for\r\ntheappellant is over and as such his incomeloss has to be quantified as 100%. There is no other way\r\nto assess the earning loss since the appellant is incapacitated for life and is confined to home. In\r\nsuch circumstances, his loss of earning capacity must be fixedat 100%.As his monthly incomewas\r\nRs.4,500\/-, adding 40% future prospect thereto,the monthly loss of earning is quantified as\r\nRs.6,300\/-. We therefore deem it appropriate to quantify Rs.13,60,800\/- (Rs.6,300 x 12 x 18) as\r\ncompensation for 100% loss of earning for the claimant. Accordingly, under this head, the amount\r\nawarded by the High Court is enhanced proportionately.\r\n17. Thelesser amount for 6 months earning loss during hospitalization, must also be corrected. The\r\nclaimant was awarded Rs.12,000\/- for his hospitalization in the aftermath of the accident. But the\r\nlower figure does not correctly correspond to six monthsloss, when the income was Rs. 4500\/- p.m.\r\nAccordingly, the amount under this head is corrected as Rs.27,000\/- (Rs.4,500 x\r\n6).\r\n18. Following the above conclusion, additional compensation is found merited for the appellant and\r\nthe same is ordered. The payableamount under the four specific heads is indicated as under:\r\n S No Head Amount claimed\r\n 1. Expense for bystander Rs.10,80,000\/-\r\n 2. Future Medical Expenses Rs.3,00,000\/-\r\n 3. Compensation for permanent Rs.13,60,800\/-\r\n disability and loss of earning\r\n power\r\n 4. Loss of earning Rs. 27,000\/-\r\n 5. Total Rs.27,67,800\/-\r\n The above quantified sum should be paid by the\r\nfirst respondent, within six weeks from today. Any\r\namount paid earlier under these heads, may be adjusted during payment to the appellant. It is\r\nordered accordingly.\r\n19. Before parting, it needs emphasizing that in cases such as this, the Tribunal and the Courts must\r\nbe conscious of the fact that the permanent disability suffered by the individual not only impairs his\r\ncognitive abilities and his physical facilities but there are multiple other non-quantifiable\r\nimplications for the victim. The very fact that a healthy person turns into an invalid, being deprived\r\nof normal companionship, and incapable of leading a productive life, makes one suffer the loss of\r\nself-dignity. Such a Claimant must not be viewed as a modern day Oliver Twist, having to make\r\nentreaties as the boy in the orphanage in Charles Dickens\u2019s classic, \u201CPlease Sir, I want some more\u201D.\r\nThe efforts must be to substantially ameliorate the misery of the claimant and recognize his actual\r\nneeds by accounting for the ground realities. The measures should however be in correct proportion.\r\nAs is aptly said by Justice R.V Raveendran, while speaking for the Division Bench in Sarla Verma\r\nand Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Another8, just compensation is adequate\r\ncompensation and the Award must be just that- no less and no more. The plea 8 (2009)6 SCC 121 of\r\nthe victim suffering from a cruel twist of fate, when asking for some more, is not extravagant but is\r\nfor seeking appropriate recompense to negotiate with the unforeseeable and the fortuitous twists is\r\nhis impaired life. Therefore, while the money awarded by Courts can hardly redress the actual\r\nsufferings of the injured victim (who is deprived of the normal amenities of life and suffers the\r\nunease of being a burden on others), the courts can make a genuine attempt to help restore the\r\nself-dignity of such claimant, by awarding \u2018just compensation\u2019.\r\n20. With the above observation and enhancement of compensation, the claimant\u2019s appeal stands\r\nallowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court stands modified to the extent indicated above.\r\nThe parties to bear their respective cost.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

          "judgement":"Hrishikesh Roy, J.\r\n1. Heard Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant\r\n(Husband). Also heard Mr. Ahmad Ibrahim, learned counsel appearing for the respondent (Wife).\r\n2. The challenge in these appeals is to the analogous judgment and order dated 25.6.2019 in the\r\nFirst Appeal No. 81 of 2017 and First Appeal No. 82 of 2017 whereby the High Court of Uttarakhand\r\nhad allowed both appeals by reversing the common order dated 4.7.2017 of the Family Court,\r\nDehradun. Before the Family Court, the appellant succeeded with his case for dissolution of\r\nmarriage but the respondent failed to secure a favourable verdict in her petition for restitution of\r\nconjugal rights.\r\n3. The appellant is an Army Officer with M.Tech qualification. The respondent is holding a faculty\r\nposition in the Government P G College, Tehri with Ph.d degree. They got married on 27.9.2006 and\r\nlived together for few months at Vishakhapatnam and at Ludhiana. But from the initial days of\r\nmarried life, differences cropped up and since 15.9.2007, the couple have lived apart.4. Following the estrangement, the appellant earlier applied for divorce from the Family Court at\r\nVishakhapatnam. The respondent then filed a petition against the respondent in the Dehradun\r\nCourt for restitution of conjugal rights. Later, when she learnt of the case filed by the appellant at\r\nVishakhapatnam, the respondent filed Transfer Petition (C) No. 1366\/2011 before this Court. The\r\nappellant appeared before the Supreme Court and stated that the case at Vishakhapatnam would be\r\nwithdrawn. This Court then recorded the following order:\r\n\u201CCounsel for the respondent states that the respondent would withdraw his petition\r\npending before the Family Court at Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh and in case he\r\nhas to file any petition seeking any relief against the petitioner (his estranged wife),\r\nhe will file the petition only before the proper Court at Dehradun, Uttarakhand. In\r\nview of the statement made at the Bar, the petitioner is left with no grievance.\r\nThe transfer petition is disposed of. We may, however, observe that in case the\r\nrespondent files a petition at Dehradun, the Dehradun Court shall take it up and\r\ndispose it of expeditiously and without any undue loss of time.\u201D\r\n5. In the divorce proceeding, the appellant pleaded that he was subjected to numerous malicious\r\ncomplaints by the respondent which have affected his career and loss of reputation, resulting in\r\nmental cruelty. On the other hand, the respondent in her case for restitution of conjugal rights\r\ncontended that the husband without any reasonable cause had deserted her and accordingly she\r\npleaded for direction to the appellant, for resumption of matrimonial life.\r\n6. The Family Court at Dehradun analogously considered both cases. The learned judge applied his\r\nmind to the evidence led by the parties, the documents on record and the arguments advanced by\r\nthe respective counsel and gave a finding that the respondent had failed to establish her allegation of\r\nadultery against the husband. It was further found that the respondent had subjected the appellant\r\nto mental cruelty with her complaints to the Army and other authorities. Consequently, the Court\r\nallowed the appellant\u2019s suit for dissolution of marriage and simultaneously dismissed the\r\nrespondent\u2019s petition for restitution of conjugal rights.\r\n7. The aggrieved parties then filed respective First Appeals before the Uttarakhand High Court. On\r\nconsideration of the pleadings and the issues framed by the trial Court, the High Court noted that\r\ncruelty is the core issue in the dispute. The Court then proceeded to examine whether the wife with\r\nher complaints to various authorities including the Army\u2019s top brass, had treated the appellant with\r\ncruelty to justify his plea for dissolution of marriage. While it was found that the wife did write to\r\nvarious authorities commenting on the appellant\u2019s character and conduct, the Division Bench\r\nopined that those cannot be construed as cruelty since no court has concluded that those allegations\r\nwere false or fabricated. According to the Court, the conduct of the parties against each other would\r\nat best be squabbles of ordinary middle class married life. Accordingly, the High Court set aside the\r\ndecree for dissolution of marriage and allowed the respondent\u2019s suit for restitution of conjugal\r\nrights, under the impugned judgment.8. Challenging the High Court\u2019s decision, Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan, the learned Senior Counsel\r\nhighlights that the respondent had filed a series of complaints against the appellant before the\r\nsuperior officers in the Army upto the level of the Chief of Army Staff and to other authorities and\r\nthese complaints have irreparably damaged the reputation and mental peace of the appellant. The\r\nappellant cannot therefore be compelled to resume matrimonial life with the respondent, in the face\r\nof such unfounded allegations and cruel treatment. Moreover, matrimonial life lasted only for few\r\nmonths and the couple have been separated since 15.9.2007 and after all these years, restitution\r\nwould not be justified or feasible.\r\n9. Per contra, Mr. Ahmad Ibrahim, the learned counsel submits that the respondent is keen to\r\nresume her matrimonial life with the appellant. According to the counsel, the respondent wrote\r\nletters and filed complaints only to assert her legal right as the married wife of the appellant and\r\nthose communications should therefore be understood as efforts made by the wife to preserve the\r\nmarital relationship. It is further contended that only because the appellant had filed the divorce\r\ncase before the Vishakhapatnam Court and had obtained an ex-parte order, the respondent was\r\nconstrained to write to various authorities to assert her right as the legally wedded wife of the\r\nappellant.\r\n10. For considering dissolution of marriage at the instance of a spouse who allege mental cruelty, the\r\nresult of such mental cruelty must be such that it is not possible to continue with the matrimonial\r\nrelationship. In other words, the wronged party cannot be expected to condone such conduct and\r\ncontinue to live with his\/her spouse. The degree of tolerance will vary from one couple to another\r\nand the Court will have to bear in mind the background, the level of education and also the status of\r\nthe parties, in order to determine whether the cruelty alleged is sufficient to justify dissolution of\r\nmarriage, at the instance of the wronged party. In Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh1, this Court gave\r\nillustrative cases where inference of mental cruelty could be drawn even while emphasizing that no\r\nuniform standard can be laid down and each case will have to be decided on its own facts.\r\n1 (2007) 4 SCC 511\r\n11. The materials in the present case reveal that the respondent had made several defamatory\r\ncomplaints to the appellant\u2019s superiors in the Army for which, a Court of inquiry was held by the\r\nArmy authorities against the appellant. Primarily for those, the appellant\u2019s career progress got\r\naffected. The Respondent was also making complaints to other authorities, such as, the State\r\nCommission for Women and has posted defamatory materials on other platforms. The net outcome\r\nof above is that the appellant\u2019s career and reputation had suffered.\r\n12. When the appellant has suffered adverse consequences in his life and career on account of the\r\nallegations made by the respondent, the legal consequences must follow and those cannot be\r\nprevented only because, no Court has determined that the allegations were false. The High Court\r\nhowever felt that without any definite finding on the credibility of the wife\u2019s allegation, the wronged\r\nspouse would be disentitled to relief. This is not found to be the correct way to deal with the issue.13. Proceeding with the above understanding, the question which requires to be answered here is\r\nwhether the conduct of the respondent would fall within the realm of mental cruelty. Here the\r\nallegations are levelled by a highly educated spouse and they do have the propensity to irreparably\r\ndamage the character and reputation of the appellant. When the reputation of the spouse is sullied\r\namongst his colleagues, his superiors and the society at large, it would be difficult to expect\r\ncondonation of such conduct by the affected party.\r\n14. The explanation of the wife that she made those complaints in order to protect the matrimonial\r\nties would not in our view, justify the persistent effort made by her to undermine the dignity and\r\nreputation of the appellant. In circumstances like this, the wronged party cannot be expected to\r\ncontinue with the matrimonial relationship and there is enough justification for him to seek\r\nseparation.\r\n15. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court was in error in describing the\r\nbroken relationship as normal wear and tear of middle class married life. It is a definite case of\r\ncruelty inflicted by the respondent against the appellant and as such enough justification is found to\r\nset aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and to restore the order passed by the Family\r\nCourt. The appellant is accordingly held entitled to dissolution of his marriage and consequently the\r\nrespondent\u2019s application for restitution of conjugal rights stands dismissed. It is ordered\r\naccordingly.\r\n16. With the above order, the appeals stand disposed of leaving the parties to bear their own cost.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 27.11.2017 passed\r\nby the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Appeal Suit No. 94 of 2010 by which the High Court\r\nhas allowed the said appeal by quashing and setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the\r\nlearned Trial Court dismissing the suit for specific performance and consequently decreeing the suit,\r\nthe original defendant has preferred the present Civil Appeal No. 6014 of 2021. 1.1 Feeling aggrieved\r\nand dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated 06.01.2020 rejecting the Review Application No.\r\n71 of 2019 in Date: 2021.10.04 16:15:23 IST Reason:\r\nAppeal Suit No. 94 of 2010, the defendant as review applicant has preferred the\r\npresent Civil Appeal No. 6015 of 2021.\r\n2. The facts leading to the present appeals in a nutshell are as under:-\r\n2.1 An agreement for sale of the property situated in Kaspa Coimbatore was entered\r\ninto between the plaintiff and the defendant wherein the defendant agreed to sell the\r\nsame for a sale consideration of Rs. 16.20 lakhs to the plaintiff. A part sale\r\nconsideration of Rs.3,60,001\/- was paid at the time of execution of the agreement to\r\nsell.\r\nThere were certain conditions stipulated in the agreement to sell. One of the conditions was that the\r\ndefendant as original owner was required to evict the tenants from the property in question and\r\nthereafter to execute the sale deed on receipt of the full sale consideration. The plaintiff sent a legal\r\nnotice to the defendant asking to evict the tenants from the property in question and to execute the\r\nsale deed on receipt of the balance sale consideration vide notice dated 01.07.2006. 2.2 That\r\nthereafter the plaintiff filed the present suit before the learned Trial Court for specific performance\r\nof the contract. It was the case on behalf of the plaintiff that he was ready and willing to perform his\r\npart of the contract but the defendant did not evict the tenants and come forward to execute the sale\r\ndeed. Therefore, it was averred in the plaint that the defendant has to evict the tenants and perform\r\nhis part of the contract and execute the sale deed. It was pleaded on behalf of the plaintiff that he\r\nwas ready with the cash in his savings account and, therefore, he was always ready to perform his\r\npart of the contract. The defendant contested the suit by filing the written statement. Readiness and\r\nwillingness on the part of the plaintiff and to perform the specific part of the contract was\r\nspecifically denied. It was submitted that vacant possession was already known to the plaintiff as the\r\ntenants had been vacated and inspite of such the plaintiff was not ready to pay the remaining\r\nconsideration. The learned Trial Court framed the following issues:-\r\n\u201C1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for specific performance?\r\n2. Whether the plaintiff was ready and willing to purchase the property?\r\n3. To what relief?\u201D 2.3 Both the sides led the evidence, documentary as well as oral.\r\nOn appreciation of evidence and considering the pleadings in the plaint, the learned\r\nTrial Court held the issue of readiness on the part of the plaintiff in favour of the\r\nplaintiff, however, held that the plaintiff was not willing to get the sale deed executed\r\nas it is, and, therefore, held the issue of willingness against the plaintiff. The Trial\r\nCourt also held that the defendant has failed to prove that tenants had vacated the\r\nsuit property as claimed, however, the learned Trial Court held on willingness against\r\nthe plaintiff by observing that the plaintiff has not shown the willingness to purchase\r\nthe property with the tenants and there are no such pleadings in the plaint and that\r\nthe plaintiff has not elected to purchase the property as its nature. Therefore, the\r\nTrial Court on appreciation of the evidence ultimately held that the plaintiff was not\r\nat all willing to purchase the property with the tenants. Accordingly, the learned Trial\r\nCourt dismissed the suit and refused to pass the decree for specific performance of\r\nthe contract and directed the defendant to refund the advance amount of\r\nRs.3,60,001\/- with interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of agreement till the date of\r\nrealization, to be paid within a period of two months. The learned Trial Court also\r\ndirected that there shall be a charge over the property till such amount is realized by\r\nthe plaintiff from the defendant.2.4 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree passed by the\r\nlearned Trial Court dismissing the suit for specific performance, the plaintiff filed the\r\nappeal suit before the High Court. By the impugned judgment and order, relying\r\nupon the affidavit filed before the High Court in which for the first time the plaintiff\r\nstated that he is ready and willing to purchase the property with the tenants, the High\r\nCourt without even re-appreciating the entire evidence on record and even without\r\nframing the points for determination has allowed the appeal by the impugned\r\njudgment and order and has set aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned\r\nTrial Court, and consequently has decreed the suit for specific performance of the\r\ncontract. 2.5 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and\r\norder\/decree passed by the High Court \u2013 First Appellate Court allowing the appeal\r\nand consequently decreeing the suit for specific performance of the contract, the\r\noriginal defendant has preferred the present appeal being Civil Appeal No.6014 of\r\n2021. After the impugned judgment and order\/decree, the defendant filed the review\r\napplication before the High Court, which has been dismissed, which is the subject\r\nmatter of Civil Appeal No.6015 of 2021.\r\n3. Shri Ratnakar Dash, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant\/defendant\r\nhas vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High\r\nCourt has materially erred in allowing the appeal and decreeing the suit for specific\r\nperformance of the contract.\r\n3.1 It is vehemently submitted by the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant that the\r\nimpugned judgment and order passed by the High Court as a First Appellate Court cannot be\r\nsustained. It is submitted that as such the High Court has not exercised the appellate jurisdiction\r\nvested in it, particularly, while exercising the jurisdiction under Section 96 read with Order XLI\r\nRule 31 of the Civil Procedure Code. It is submitted that the High Court has not at all re-appreciated\r\nthe evidence on record and without even discussing the evidence on record and even without raising\r\nthe points for determination on the basis of the issues which were framed by the learned Trial Court,\r\nthe High Court has allowed the appeal and has decreed the suit for specific performance, which\r\notherwise is not permissible.\r\n3.2 It is further submitted by learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that there\r\nis no re-appreciation of evidence on the issue of willingness on the part of the plaintiff, which was\r\ndealt with and considered by the learned Trial court in detail and the issue which was held against\r\nthe plaintiff.\r\n3.3 It is submitted that even the High Court has erred in passing the impugned judgment and order\r\nrelying upon the affidavit of the respondent-plaintiff, which was filed before the High Court in which\r\nfor the first time the plaintiff came out with a case that he is ready and willing to purchase the\r\nproperty with tenants. It is submitted that such a course adopted by the High Court is wholly\r\nimpermissible under the law. 3.4 It is submitted that what was not pleaded by the plaintiff in the\r\nplaint on willingness to purchase the property with tenants has now been permitted by the High\r\nCourt relying upon the affidavit filed before the High Court for the first time. It is submitted that theaffidavit filed by the plaintiff before the High Court that he is ready and willing to purchase the\r\nproperty with tenants is just contrary to the pleadings in the plaint and even the findings recorded\r\nby the learned Trial Court. 3.5 It is further submitted by learned senior counsel appearing for the\r\nappellant that as such the plaintiff never agreed to purchase the property with tenants and as per the\r\ncase of the plaintiff and so averred in the plaint, it was pleaded that it was the responsibility of the\r\ndefendant to evict the tenants and hand over the peaceful vacant possession and execute the sale\r\ndeed. It is submitted that, therefore, thereafter it was not open on the part of the plaintiff to submit\r\nthat he is ready and willing to purchase the property with tenants and that too by an affidavit for the\r\nfirst time filed before the High Court.\r\n3.6 It is submitted that without even permitting the plaintiff to amend the plaint, the course adopted\r\nby the High Court permitting to change his stand by way of an affidavit is unknown to law and the\r\nprocedure to be followed under the provisions of the CPC. Making above submissions and relying\r\nupon the decisions of this Court in the case of B.V. Nagesh and Anr. Vs. H.V. Sreenivasa Murthy,\r\n(2010) 13 SCC 530, H. Siddiqui (Dead) by LRs. Vs. A. Ramalingam (2011) 4 SCC 240 and State Bank\r\nof India and Anr. Vs. Emmsons International Limited and Anr. (2011) 12 SCC 174, it is prayed to\r\nallow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the\r\nHigh Court and consequently dismiss the suit.\r\n4. Present appeal is vehemently opposed by Mr. Navaniti Prasad Singh, learned senior counsel\r\nappearing on behalf of the respondent \u2013 original plaintiff.\r\n4.1 It is vehemently submitted by learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent -\r\nplaintiff that as such as per the condition in the agreement to sell, it was the responsibility of the\r\ndefendant to evict the tenants and thereafter to hand over the peaceful and vacant possession and\r\nexecute the sale deed on receipt of the balance sale consideration. It is submitted that in the present\r\ncase admittedly the defendant did not perform his part of evicting the tenants. It is submitted,\r\ntherefore, that to allow the suit and pass the decree for specific performance will tantamount to\r\ngiving a premium to the defendant, who has failed to perform his part under the agreement to sell.\r\n4.2 It is submitted that as such against the total sale consideration of Rs.16.20 lakhs, defendant paid\r\nonly Rs. 3,60,001\/- at the time of execution of agreement to sell. It is submitted that, therefore,\r\nwhen subsequently the learned Trial Court held that plaintiff did not elect to get the sale deed\r\nexecuted with tenants, the defendant rightly filed an affidavit before the High Court and stated that\r\nhe is ready and willing to get the sale deed executed even with tenants. It is submitted, therefore,\r\nthat by allowing the defendant to file the affidavit to contend that he is ready and willing to get the\r\nsale deed executed and to purchase the property with tenants, the High Court has done the\r\nsubstantial justice so as to not to permit the defendant to take the benefit of his own wrong in not\r\nevicting the tenants.\r\n4.3 It is further submitted by learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent -\r\nplaintiff that even the defendant has not returned the amount of part consideration paid, i.e.,\r\nRs.3,60,001\/- with interest @ 18% p.a. to the plaintiff though directed by the learned Trial Court. In\r\nthe alternative, it is submitted by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondentthat the technicalities shall not come in the way of the plaintiff and, therefore, the matter may be\r\nremitted to the High Court and permit the plaintiff to amend the plaint in exercise of powers under\r\nOrder VI Rule 17 of the CPC.\r\n4.4 Alternatively, it is also submitted that if this Court is of the opinion that the High Court ought\r\nnot to have disposed of the appeal without determining the points for determination on the issues\r\nframed by the learned Trial Court, in that case, the matter may be remitted to the High Court for\r\nfresh consideration and to decide and dispose of the appeal afresh after framing the points for\r\ndetermination as required under Order XLI Rule 31 of the CPC. Making above submissions, it is\r\nprayed to dismiss the present appeal.\r\n5. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.\r\n6. In the present case, the original plaintiff instituted a suit for specific performance of the contract.\r\nOn appreciation of evidence, the learned Trial Court held the issue of readiness in favour of the\r\nplaintiff. However, refused to pass the decree for specific performance of the contract on the ground\r\nthat the plaintiff was not willing to purchase the property with tenants. Therefore, the issue with\r\nrespect to willingness was held against the plaintiff. In an appeal filed before the High Court under\r\nSection 96 read with Order XLI by the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has allowed\r\nthe said appeal and has quashed and set aside the decree passed by the learned Trial Court\r\ndismissing the suit and consequently has decreed the suit for specific performance. Having gone\r\nthrough the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it can be seen that there is a\r\ntotal non-compliance of the Order XLI Rule 31 of CPC. While disposing of the appeal, the High\r\nCourt has not raised the points for determination as required under Order XLI Rule 31 CPC. It also\r\nappears that the High Court being the First Appellate court has not discussed the entire matter and\r\nthe issues in detail and as such it does not reveal that the High Court has re-appreciated the\r\nevidence while disposing of the first appeal. It also appears that the High Court has disposed of the\r\nappeal preferred under Order XLI CPC read with Section 96 in a most casual and perfunctory\r\nmanner. Apart from the fact that the High Court has not framed the points for determination as\r\nrequired under Order XLI Rule 31 CPC, it appears that even the High Court has not exercised the\r\npowers vested in it as a First Appellate Court. As observed above, the High Court has neither reappreciated the entire evidence on record nor has given any specific findings on the issues which\r\nwere even raised before the learned Trial Court.\r\n6.1 In the case of B.V. Nagesh and Anr. (supra), this Court has observed and held that without\r\nframing points for determination and considering both facts and law; without proper discussion and\r\nassigning the reasons, the First Appellate Court cannot dispose of the first appeal under Section 96\r\nCPC and that too without raising the points for determination as provided under Order XLI Rule 31\r\nCPC. In paragraphs 3 and 4, it is observed and held as under:-\r\n\u201C3. How the regular first appeal is to be disposed of by the appellate court\/High Court\r\nhas been considered by this Court in various decisions. Order 41 CPC deals with\r\nappeals from original decrees. Among the various rules, Rule 31 mandates that the\r\njudgment of the appellate court shall state:(a) the points for determination;\r\n(b) the decision thereon;\r\n(c) the reasons for the decision; and\r\n(d) where the decree appealed from is reversed or varied, the relief to which the\r\nappellant is entitled.\r\n4. The appellate court has jurisdiction to reverse or affirm the findings of the trial court. The first\r\nappeal is a valuable right of the parties and unless restricted by law, the whole case is therein open\r\nfor rehearing both on questions of fact and law. The judgment of the appellate court must, therefore,\r\nreflect its conscious application of mind and record findings supported by reasons, on all the issues\r\narising along with the contentions put forth, and pressed by the parties for decision of the appellate\r\ncourt. Sitting as a court of first appeal, it was the duty of the High Court to deal with all the issues\r\nand the evidence led by the parties before recording its findings. The first appeal is a valuable right\r\nand the parties have a right to be heard both on questions of law and on facts and the judgment in\r\nthe first appeal must address itself to all the issues of law and fact and decide it by giving reasons in\r\nsupport of the findings.

(supra) while considering the scope and ambit of exercise\r\nof powers under Section 96 of CPC by the Appellate Court and after considering the decisions of this\r\nCourt in the cases of Madhukar and Ors. Vs. Sangram and Ors., (2001) 4 SCC 756; H.K.N. Swami\r\nVs. Irshad Basith (Dead) by LRs., (2005) 10 SCC 243 and Jagannath Vs. Arulappa and Anr., (2005)\r\n12 SCC 303, it is held that sitting as a Court of First Appeal, it is the duty of the Appellate Court to\r\ndeal with all the issues and the evidence led by the parties before recording its findings. 6.3 In the\r\ncase of H. Siddiqui (Dead) by LRs. (supra), it is observed and held in paragraph 21 as under:-\r\n\u201C21. The said provisions provide guidelines for the appellate court as to how the court\r\nhas to proceed and decide the case. The provisions should be read in such a way as to\r\nrequire that the various particulars mentioned therein should be taken into\r\nconsideration. Thus, it must be evident from the judgment of the appellate court that\r\nthe court has properly appreciated the facts\/evidence, applied its mind and decided\r\nthe case considering the material on record. It would amount to substantial\r\ncompliance with the said provisions if the appellate court's judgment is based on the\r\nindependent assessment of the relevant evidence on all important aspects of the\r\nmatter and the findings of the appellate court are well founded and quite convincing.\r\nIt is mandatory for the appellate court to independently assess the evidence of the\r\nparties and consider the relevant points which arise for adjudication and the bearing\r\nof the evidence on those points. Being the final court of fact, the first appellate court\r\nmust not record mere general expression of concurrence with the trial court\r\njudgment rather it must give reasons for its decision on each point independently to\r\nthat of the trial court. Thus, the entire evidence must be considered and discussed in\r\ndetail. Such exercise should be done after formulating the points for consideration in\r\nterms of the said provisions and the court must proceed in adherence to the\r\nrequirements of the said statutory provisions.

Diocese of Madurai [(2006) 3 SCC 224] , Shiv Kumar\r\nSharma v. Santosh Kumari [(2007) 8 SCC 600] and Gannmani Anasuya v. Parvatini\r\nAmarendra Chowdhary [(2007) 10 SCC 296 : AIR 2007 SC 2380] .)\u201D\r\n7. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions, if the impugned judgment and\r\norder passed by the High Court is considered, in that case, there is a total non-compliance of the\r\nprovisions of the Order XLI Rule 31 CPC. The High Court has failed to exercise the jurisdiction\r\nvested in it as a First Appellate Court; the High Court has not at all re-appreciated the entire\r\nevidence on record; and not even considered the reasoning given by the learned Trial Court, in\r\nparticular, on findings recorded by the learned Trial Court on the issue of willingness. Therefore, as\r\nsuch, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is unsustainable and in normal\r\ncircumstances we would have accepted the request of the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf\r\nof the respondent to remand the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration of appeal.\r\nHowever, even on other points also, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is\r\nnot sustainable. We refrain from remanding the matter to the High Court and we decide the appeal\r\non merits.\r\n8. It is required to be noted that as per the case of the original plaintiff, the defendant was required\r\nto evict the tenants and hand over the physical and vacant possession at the time of execution of the\r\nsale deed on payment of full sale consideration. Even in the suit notice issued by the plaintiff, the\r\nplaintiff called upon the defendant to evict the tenants and thereafter execute the sale deed on\r\npayment of full consideration from the plaintiff. Even when we consider the pleadings and the\r\naverments in the plaint, it appears that the plaintiff was never willing to get the sale deed executed\r\nwith tenants and\/or as it is. It was the insistence on the part of the plaintiff to deliver the vacant\r\npossession after evicting the tenants. Therefore, on the basis of the pleadings in the plaint and on\r\nappreciation of evidence, the learned Trial Court held the issue of willingness against the plaintiff.\r\nHowever, before the High Court, the plaintiff filed an affidavit stating that he is now ready and\r\nwilling to get the sale deed executed with respect to the property with tenants and unfortunately, the\r\nHigh Court relying upon the affidavit in the first appeal considered that as now the plaintiff is ready\r\nand willing to purchase the property with tenants and get the sale deed executed with respect to the\r\nproperty in question with tenants, the High Court has allowed the appeal and decreed the suit for\r\nspecific performance. The aforesaid procedure adopted by the High Court relying upon the affidavit\r\nin a First Appeal by which virtually without submitting any application for amendment of the plaint\r\nunder Order VI Rule 17 CPC, the High Court as a First Appellate Court has taken on record the\r\naffidavit and as such relied upon the same. Such a procedure is untenable and unknown to law. First\r\nappeals are to be decided after following the procedure to be followed under the CPC. The affidavit,\r\nwhich was filed by the plaintiff and which has been relied upon by the High Court is just contrary to\r\nthe pleadings in the plaint. As observed hereinabove, there were no pleadings in the plaint that he is\r\nready and willing to purchase the property and get the sale deed executed of the property with\r\ntenants and the specific pleadings were to hand over the peaceful and vacant possession after getting\r\nthe tenants evicted and to execute the sale deed. The proper procedure would have been for the\r\nplaintiff to move a proper application for amendment of the plaint in exercise of the power under\r\nOrder VI Rule 17 CPC, if at all it would have been permissible in a first appeal under Section 96 read\r\nwith Order XLI CPC. However, straightaway to rely upon the affidavit without amending the plaint\r\nand the pleadings is wholly impermissible under the law. Therefore, such a procedure adopted by\r\nthe High Court is disapproved.\r\nThe learned Trial Court held the issue of willingness against the plaintiff by giving cogent reasons\r\nand appreciation of evidence and considering the pleadings and averments in the plaint. We have\r\nalso gone through the averments and the pleadings in the plaint and on considering the same, we\r\nare of the opinion that the learned Trial Court was justified in holding the issue of willingness\r\nagainst the plaintiff. The plaintiff was never ready and willing to purchase the property and\/or get\r\nthe sale deed executed of the property with tenants. It was for the first time before the High Court in\r\nthe affidavit filed before the High Court and subsequently when the learned Trial Court held the\r\nissue of willingness against the plaintiff, the plaintiff came out with a case that he is ready and\r\nwilling to purchase the property with tenants. For the purpose of passing the decree for specific\r\nperformance, the plaintiff has to prove both the readiness and willingness. Therefore, once it is\r\nfound on appreciation of evidence that there was no willingness on the part of the plaintiff, the\r\nplaintiff is not entitled to the decree for specific performance. Therefore, in the present case, the\r\nlearned Trial Court was justified in refusing to pass the decree for specific performance.\r\n9. The submission on behalf of the plaintiff that in the agreement a duty was cast upon the\r\ndefendant to evict the tenants and to handover the vacant and peaceful possession, which the\r\ndefendant failed and, therefore, in such a situation, not to pass a decree for specific performance in\r\nfavour of the plaintiff would be giving a premium to the defendant despite he having failed to\r\nperform his part of the contract. The aforesaid seems to be attractive but for the purpose of passing\r\na decree for specific performance, readiness and willingness has to be established and proved and\r\nthat is the relevant consideration for the purpose of passing a decree for specific performance.\r\n10. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the plaintiff that even the defendant has not refunded\r\nthe amount of Rs.3,60,001\/- with interest @ 18% as ordered by the learned Trial Court concerned,\r\nthe order passed by the learned Trial Court is very clear and the defendant is saddled with the law to\r\npay the interest @ 18% till its realization. Therefore, the plaintiff is compensated by awarding 18%\r\ninterest. His not refunding the amount of part sale consideration with 18% interest as ordered by the\r\nlearned Trial Court cannot be a ground to confirm the impugned judgment and order passed by the\r\nHigh Court. The plaintiff as such could have filed an execution petition to execute the\r\njudgment\/decree passed by the learned Trial Court. Further, we propose to issue a direction to the\r\nappellant \u2013 original defendant directing him to refund the amount of Rs.3,60,001\/- with 18%\r\ninterest from the date of the agreement till the date of realization within a period of eight weeks\r\nfrom today.\r\n11. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, both the appeal succeeds. The impugned\r\njudgment and order passed by the High Court of judicature at Madras in Appeal Suit No. 94 of 2010\r\nis hereby quashed and set aside and the judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court\r\nstands restored. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant herein originaldefendant is directed to refund the amount of Rs.3,60,001\/- with 18% interest from the date of\r\nagreement till realization within a period of eight weeks from today. Appeals are allowed to the\r\naforesaid extent, however, there shall be no order as to costs.\r\nPending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.\r\n \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.\r\n [M.R.

          "judgement":"S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.\r\n1. In these appeals by Special Leave, a common judgment - in two second appeals1 rendered by the\r\nKarnataka High Court- reversing the decree of the first appellate court, has been challenged.\r\n2. The facts relevant for the purposes of this case are that the registered sale deeds were executed on\r\n28.05.1973 in respect of distinct parcels of land. On the same day, one of the transactions related to\r\nthe sale of three parcels, which is survey no. 36\/1 (28 guntas); survey no.37 (1 acre 30 guntas) and\r\nsurvey no.28\/2 (13 guntas)- collectively called \u201Cthe suit lands\u201D by common sale deed \u2013 exhibited as\r\nEx-1 before the trial court. This document is not in dispute. In OS No.20\/1985, the\r\nplaintiff\/respondent and purchaser herein filed a suit for declaration of title and recovery of\r\npossession as well as mesne profits in relation to the suit properties (hereafter called \u201Cthe first suit\u201D).\r\nThe claim was Dated 31.07.2008 in RSA Nos. 368\/2002 and 736\/2002 premised on the fact that the\r\nplaintiff\/respondents had purchased the suit properties by the registered sale deed from the\r\nappellants (defendants in the suit). It was contended that though the appellants had put the\r\nplaintiff\/ respondents in possession, later, upon developing ill will, they moved the Land Tribunal\r\nseeking occupancy rights and proceeded to dispossess them, i.e. the plaintiff\/respondents from the\r\nsuit property. The Land Tribunal initially ruled in favor of the appellants; however, those findings\r\nwere set aside by the High Court in W.P. 12662\/1981. The question was remanded to the Land\r\nTribunal for fresh consideration. This time round, the Land Tribunal directed the parties to\r\napproach the Civil Court for adjudication of disputes. The plaintiff\/respondent therefore filed the\r\nfirst suit, for declaration and possession. The appellants defended the first suit and denied the\r\nclaims.\r\n3. The appellants filed another suit \u2013 (OS 22\/1985 hereafter referred to as the \u201Csecond suit\u201D). In the\r\nsecond suit, it was alleged that the sale deed Ex-1 in favour of the respondent (defendant in second\r\nsuit) was a nominal one and was executed as a security for the loan advanced by the respondent. The\r\nappellants relied upon a document which they claimed was an agreement of sale under which\r\nallegedly the respondent had agreed to execute or reconvey the suit properties to the appellants. In\r\nterms of this agreement, the appellants were to pay \u0084 9000\/- to the respondent within three years.\r\nAlleging that the respondent did not execute the sale deed, despite having received full payment of \u0084\r\n9000\/- with interest @ 15% per annum, the appellants filed the second suit for declaration, of title\r\nand permanent injunction and in the alternative, specific performance of the agreement of sale\r\ndated 28.05.1973. The appellants also urged and claimed that they were in possession of the suit\r\nproperties.\r\n4. The Trial Court framed issues with respect to the title, possession and specific performance and\r\nproceeded to record the common evidence. The trial court held that the respondent was absolute\r\nowner of the suit properties by virtue of sale deed \u2013 (a registered document) and also concluded that\r\nthe appellants who had filed the second suit were in illegal possession of the suit properties. With\r\nrespect to the disputes in the second suit, the trial court held that the appellants failed to establish\r\nexecution of the agreement for which they had sought specific performance. The issue was decided\r\non the basis of evidence relied upon by the parties. As a result, the respondent\u2019s suit, i.e. the first suit\r\nfor declaration, title and possession was decreed, in his favour. The appellants\u2019 suit, however, was\r\ndismissed.\r\n5. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the second suit as well as the decree in favour of the respondent in\r\nthe first suit, appeals were filed by the appellant before the Additional District Judge. Both the\r\nappeals were considered together\r\n- as in the case of a common judgment by the trial court. The first appellate court gave credence to\r\nthe submissions of the appellants and allowed their plea. As a result, it was held that the sale deed in\r\nfavour of the respondents was a nominal one and not meant to be acted upon. It was also held that\r\nthe appellants had proved the agreement to sell and were entitled to a decree for specific\r\nperformance.\r\n6. The aggrieved respondents approached the High Court with two second appeals, i.e. RSA No.\r\n368\/2002 and RSA No. 736\/2002. The respondents contended that the dismissal of their suit on the\r\none hand and the decree of the second suit in favour of the present appellants by the first appellate\r\ncourt, on the other, was in error of law. The Karnataka High Court framed the following question of\r\nlaw for consideration:\r\n\u201CWhether the lower appellate Court was justified in granting the decree in favor of the\r\nrespondent on the basis of Exb-3\"\r\n7. The High Court noted that the principal ground was in regard to the genuineness and veracity of\r\nthe agreement to sell relied upon by the appellant, i.e. Ex D-3. After noting that the findings of the\r\ntrial court were in favour of the respondent, which stood reversed by the first appellate court, the\r\nHigh Court proceeded to consider whether Ex.D-3 could be considered as a genuine document,\r\nhaving regard to the materials on record. The High Court noted that the trial court\u2019s findings were\r\nbased upon several factors. The first, was the manner of writing in Ex.D-3, which was different from\r\nthe manner of writing in Ex P-1 (the admitted registered sale deed). It was specifically noticed that\r\nEx.D-3 did not contain any particulars with respect to lands situated and part of the suit (i.e. Survey\r\nNos.36-38) as well as the extent of land in those survey numbers and the other relevant particulars.\r\nOn a comparison of the alleged agreement to sell (Ex.D-3) with the admitted sale deed (Ex.P-1)\r\nalong with the other documents, the High Court noted that the trial court did not accept the\r\ncontention of the appellants that Ex.D-3 was executed the same day as Ex.P-1. The second reason\r\nwhich the High Court noted for rejection of Ex D- 3 by the trial court was that the document\r\ncontained no condition regarding payment of interest on the sale consideration amount which was\r\nallegedly a loan. The evidence of the appellants, on the other hand, was that 15% interest was agreed\r\nto be paid and that they had paid \u0084 2700\/- as interest along with the sale amount or loan amount to\r\nthe respondent. This contradiction between the pleading and documents on the one hand, and the\r\noral evidence on the other hand, was held to constitute a factor against the present appellant.\r\nThirdly, it was noted that the appellants did not produce any evidence to establish that the interest\r\nwas in fact paid, or as a matter of fact that the principal amount of \u00849000\/- was paid back. In this\r\nregard, the omission to record a receipt and produce it before the court was also held to be fatal to\r\ntheir case. It was lastly held by the trial court that the claim in the second suit for specific\r\nperformance was also barred since it was a specific contention of the appellant that the time for\r\nrepayment of \u0084 9000\/- was three years which had long since passed. The other findings too were\r\nnoted by the High Court.\r\n8. The High Court, after noting these facts and also considering Ex.D-3, held that the trial court\u2019s\r\njudgment and decree, based on an overall consideration of the findings before it, was sound and\r\njustified. The High Court was of the opinion that in the course of a trial, the court could examine a\r\ndocument under Section 73 of the Evidence Act. Since the respondent had not admitted his\r\nsignatures on Ex.D-3, the Court acted within its powers to examine the admitted document, i.e.\r\nEx.P-1 and compare the signatures on it with that of the disputed documents, Ex.D-3. Another\r\nimportant circumstance which weighed with the High Court was that the appellants did not claim\r\nthemselves to be owners despite executing Ex. P-1 because in their application before the Land\r\nTribunal (filed after executing Ex.P-1), they had admitted that the respondents were the owners of\r\nthe suit lands. In fact the appellants\u2019 plea was that they were tenants of the respondent. The High\r\nCourt held that there was no reason for the appellants to put forward such a contention before the\r\nTribunal had Ex.P-1 been merely a nominal document. The High Court noted that the trial court had\r\nalso considered other evidence, such as the revenue records Ex.P- 4 and Ex.P-5 in which the\r\nrespondents were shown as khatedars. The High Court reasoned that had Ex.P-1 been only a\r\nnominal sale deed, the appellants would not have permitted the revenue authorities to change the\r\nnames of owners of land by allowing the respondent\u2019s name to be replaced on the record.\r\nContentions of the parties\r\n9. It is urged on behalf of the appellants, that the High Court fell into error, in interfering with the\r\nfirst appellate court\u2019s decree. Pointing to Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) it was\r\nurged that in a second appeal, the High Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to examining only substantial\r\nquestions of law; in this case, the court proceeded to appreciate the evidence, and differ with the\r\nfindings of the first appellate court, which is the final court of facts. Furthermore, examination of the\r\ndocuments, particularly Ex.D-3 was a purely factual aspect, which could not be, by any stretch of the\r\nimagination, considered a legal issue, much less a substantial question of law.\r\n10. Counsel for the respondent urged this court not to interfere with the impugned judgment, and\r\nsubmitted that the High Court endorsed the findings of the trial court, which were in consonance\r\nwith law and the evidence on the record. It was submitted that the trial court having regard to the\r\nevidence led noted several important features about Ex.D-3, such as lack of any details of the land,\r\nor such like particulars, or any mention about the interest payable; all of which rendered it suspect.\r\nFurthermore, the so-called agreement to sell (Ex. D3) was contradicted by other evidence on the record.\r\nAnalysis and conclusions\r\n11. It is evident from the above discussion that the respondent, in the first suit, claimed possession\r\non the basis of the registered sale deed, Ex.P-1. That document is not denied. The rival case set-up in\r\ndefence by the appellants as well as the claim in the second suit was that Ex.P-1 was nominal and in\r\nfact meant as a security; the appellants also contended that the suit land were to be re-conveyed\r\nafter receiving full payment of \u00849000, which was in effect made over to the respondent. It is a\r\nmatter of record that the appellants had applied for and were granted occupancy rights under the\r\nKarnataka Land Reforms Act. On the order of the Land Tribunal, the respondent was dispossessed.\r\nThe Tribunal\u2019s order was set aside by the High Court which remanded the application for reconsideration afresh. In the second round, the Tribunal relegated the parties to the Civil Court. In\r\nthese circumstances, the two suits were filed.\r\n12. The trial court rejected the appellant\u2019s defence and decreed the suit, disbelieving the agreement\r\nto sell (Ex.D-3). Its conclusions were based upon several reasons. As noted previously, Ex.D-3\r\nneither spelled out the details of the suit lands, nor did it state any payment of interest, as was the\r\nposition too by the appellants. Furthermore, the trial court also examined the documentary evidence\r\nin the form of the application for occupancy rights which clearly disclosed the respondents as\r\nowners and claimed that the appellants were tenants under them. Lastly, it was held that the\r\nwritings on Ex.D-3 which was allegedly executed on the same day as Ex.P-1 (the admitted sale deed)\r\nwere not the same. The respondent had denied Ex.D-3. The first appellate court faulted the trial\r\ncourt for not believing Ex.D-3 and proceeded to hold that it was genuine. The substantial question of\r\nlaw framed by the High Court was with respect to the interpretation of Ex.D-3 by the first appellate\r\ncourt.13. The impugned judgment has recounted the reasons which persuaded the trial court to reject\r\nEx.D-3 and approved them. At the same time, the High Court found fault with the first appellant\r\ncourt in ignoring the important reasons, which were rooted in the facts of the case, based upon the\r\nrecord which had resulted in rejection of Ex.D-3 and the decree for possession. The appellants\u2019\r\ntheme song is that in second appeal, the High Court could not have interfered with what are termed\r\nas pure findings of fact. It is submitted that an examination of Ex.D-3 cannot be termed as\r\nsubstantial question of law, but rather amounts to pure appreciation of facts.\r\n14. Undoubtedly, the jurisdiction which a High Court derives under Section 100 is based upon its\r\nframing of a substantial question of law. As a matter of law, it is axiomatic that the findings of the\r\nfirst appellate court are final. However, the rule that sans a substantial question of law, the High\r\nCourts cannot interfere with findings of the lower Court or concurrent findings of fact, is subject to\r\ntwo important caveats. The first is that, if the findings of fact are palpably perverse or outrage the\r\nconscience of the court; in other words, it flies on the face of logic that given the facts on the record,\r\ninterference would be justified. The other is where the findings of fact may call for examination and\r\nbe upset, in the limited circumstances spelt out in Section 103 CPC.\r\n15. Section 103 CPC reads as follows:\r\n\u201C103.Power of High Court to determine issues of fact In any second appeal, the High\r\nCourt may, if the evidence on the record is sufficient, determine any issue necessary\r\nfor the disposal of the appeal,-\r\n(a) which has not been determined by the lower Appellate Court or both by the Court\r\nof first instance and the lower Appellate Court, or\r\n(b) which has been wrongly determined by such Court or Courts reason of a decision\r\non such question of law as is referred to in section 100.\u201D\r\n16. In the judgment reported as Municipal Committee, Hoshiarpur v. Punjab State Electricity\r\nBoard2 , this court held as follows:\r\n\u201C26. Thus, it is evident that Section 103 CPC is not an exception to Section 100 CPC\r\nnor is it meant to supplant it, rather it is to serve the same purpose.\r\nEven while pressing Section 103 CPC in service, the High Court has to record a finding that it had to\r\nexercise such power, because it found that finding (s) of fact recorded by the court (s) below stood\r\nvitiated because of perversity. More so, such power can be exercised only in exceptional\r\ncircumstances and with circumspection, where the core question involved in the case has not been\r\ndecided by the court(s) below.\r\n27. There is no prohibition on entertaining a second appeal even on a question of fact provided the\r\ncourt is satisfied that the findings of fact recorded by the courts below stood vitiated by\r\nnon-consideration of relevant evidence or by showing an erroneous approach to the matter i.e. that\r\nthe findings of fact are found to be perverse. But the High Court cannot interfere with the\r\nconcurrent findings of fact in a routine and casual manner by substituting its subjective satisfaction\r\nin place of that of the lower courts. (Vide Jagdish Singh v. Natthu Singh [(1992) 1 SCC 647];\r\nKarnataka Board of Wakf v. Anjuman-E-Ismail Madris-Un-Niswan [(1999) 6 SCC 343] and Dinesh\r\nKumar v. Yusuf Ali [(2010) 12 SCC 740].)\r\n28. If a finding of fact is arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking into\r\nconsideration irrelevant material or if the finding so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the\r\nvice of irrationality incurring the blame of being perverse, then the finding is rendered infirm in the\r\neye of the law. If the findings of the Court are based on no evidence or evidence which is thoroughly\r\nunreliable or evidence that suffers from the vice of procedural irregularity or the findings are such\r\nthat no reasonable person would have arrived at those findings, then the findings may be said to be\r\nperverse. Further if the findings are either ipse dixit of the Court or based on conjecture and\r\nsurmises, the judgment suffers from the additional infirmity of non-application of mind and thus,\r\nstands vitiated. (Vide Bharatha Matha v. R. Vijaya Renganathan [(2010) 11 SCC 483]\u201D (2010) 13 SCC\r\n216\r\n17. In a recent judgment of this court, Narayan Sitaramji Badwaik (Dead) Through Lrs. v Bisaram &\r\nOrs3 this court observed as follows, in the context of High Courts\u2019 jurisdiction to appreciate factual\r\nissues under Section 103 IPC:\r\n\u201C11. A bare perusal of this section clearly indicates that it provides for the High Court\r\nto decide an issue of fact, provided there is sufficient evidence on record before it, in\r\ntwo circumstances. First, when an issue necessary for the disposal of the appeal has\r\nnot been determined by the lower Appellate Court or by both the Courts below. And\r\nsecond, when an issue of fact has been wrongly determined by the Court(s) below by\r\nvirtue of the decision on the question of law under Section 100 of the Code of Civil\r\nProcedure.\u201D\r\n18. In the opinion of this court, in the present case, the High Court recorded sound and convincing\r\nreasons why the first appellate court\u2019s judgment required interference. These were entirely based\r\nupon the evidence led by the parties on the record. The appreciation of evidence by the first\r\nappellate court was on the basis of it having overlooked material facts, such as appreciation of\r\ndocumentary and oral evidence led before the trial court, that the execution of Ex.D-3 was denied.\r\nIn these circumstances, the burden was upon the appellants to establish that the registered sale deed\r\nwas a nominal document. The findings of the trial court \u2013as was duly noticed by the High Court\r\nrecorded five cogent reasons why the appellants\u2019 pleas could not be accepted. The deposition with\r\nrespect to repayment of \u0084 9000\/- apart from being bereft of particulars, was also contrary to the\r\nprovisions inasmuch as there was no averment with respect to payment of interest @ 15%.\r\nFurthermore, the appellants\u2019 application for occupancy rights made after the sale deed and the\r\nalleged agreement to sell were executed claimed that the appellants were tenants under the\r\nrespondent. Eventually, the order of the Land Tribunal was set aside; upon remand the Land\r\nTribunal was of the opinion that it did not have the jurisdiction to decide the 2021 SCC OnLine SC\r\n319 issue and left it to the trial court to do so. These important aspects appeared to have been not\r\nappreciated \u2013 and their import were overlooked. As a consequence, the first appellate court fell into\r\nerror in overlooking important evidence and appreciating the record in its true perspective and\r\nreversed the decree of the trial court. Moreover, the High Court, in second appeal proceeded to\r\nexamine the documents in light of the evidence led and corrected the findings as it were under\r\nSection 103. If the appellants\u2019 arguments were to prevail, the findings of fact based upon an entirely\r\nerroneous appreciation of facts and by overlooking material evidence would necessarily have to\r\nremain and bind the parties, thereby causing injustice. It is precisely for such reasons that the High\r\nCourts are empowered to exercise limited factual review under Section 103 CPC. However, that such\r\npower could be exercised cannot be doubted. The impugned judgment does not expressly refer to\r\nthat provision. In the circumstances of the case, it is evident that the High Court exercised the power\r\nin the light of that provision. Furthermore, we are also of the opinion that having regard to the\r\noverall circumstances, the impugned judgment does not call for interference in exercise of special\r\nleave jurisdiction (which is available to this Court \u2013 even at the stage of final hearing).\r\n19. In view of the foregoing discussion, it is held that there is no merit in the appeals which are\r\naccordingly dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\r\n.....................................................J [L.

          "judgement":"V. Ramasubramanian, J.\r\n1. In a Civil Revision Petition filed under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short\r\n\u201Cthe Code\u201D), challenging an order of the trial Court refusing to condone the delay of 862 days in\r\nseeking to set aside an ex\u2212parte decree for specific performance, the High Court found that the ex\u2212\r\nparte decree was a nullity, as it was passed against a minor without the minor being represented by\r\na guardian duly appointed in terms of the procedure contemplated under Order XXXII, Rule 3 of\r\nthe Code. Therefore, the High Court, exercising its power of superintendence under Article 227 of\r\nthe Constitution, set aside the ex\u2212parte decree itself on condition that the petitioners before the\r\nHigh Court\/defendants pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000\/\u2212, representing the amount already spent by the\r\ndecree holders in purchasing stamp paper etc. Aggrieved by the said order of the High Court, the\r\ndecree holders are before us in this special leave petition.\r\n2. We have heard Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners\/plaintiffs\r\nand Mr. R. Balasubramanian, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents\/defendants.\r\n3. In a suit O.S. No.264 of 2013 filed by the petitioners\u2212herein for specific performance of an\r\nagreement of sale dated 25.04.2011, the respondents were duly served with summons, but after\r\nhaving entered appearance through counsel they remained ex\u2212parte. The trial Court decreed the\r\nsuit ex\u2212parte on 08.04.2015.\r\n4. At this stage it may be relevant to take note of one fact, namely, that the petitioners sought, as an\r\nalternate relief, a decree for refund of the money paid with interest at 18% per annum in the event of\r\nthe Court not granting the relief of specific performance. But the trial Court held albeit without\r\nreasons, that the petitioners are entitled, for the primary relief of specific performance.\r\n5. In the plaint as it was filed by the petitioners\u2212herein, the third defendant was described as \u201Cminor\r\nS Aravindarajan, aged about 16 years, son of Sampathkumar represented by the next friend father\r\nM. Sampathkumar\u201D. Therefore, the petitioners had filed, along with the plaint, an application in I.A\r\nNo.981 of 2013 under Order XXXII, Rule 3 of the Code for appointing the second respondent\u2212\r\nherein (his father and the second defendant) as the guardian of the minor. As noted by the High\r\nCourt, the trial Court, after serving notice on the second defendant, passed an Order in I.A.No. 981\r\nof 2013 on 23.03.2014 to the following effect:\u2212 \u201CBatta served. Vakalat by guardian to minor filed.\r\nHence this petition is closed.\u201D\r\n6. Seeking execution of the decree, the petitioners filed E.P No.33 of 2015. Notices were served on all\r\nthe respondents in the Execution Petition and the Execution Petition is said to have come up for\r\nhearing on two dates in December\u22122015 and on several dates in the year 2016. Eventually the\r\nrespondents were set ex\u2212parte in the Execution Petition on 18.10.2016 and the petition was allowed.\r\n7. Thereafter the respondents filed an application in November\u2212 2016 for setting aside the ex\u2212parte\r\norder in the Execution Petition. It was numbered only in the year 2017 as E.A. No.40 of 2017.\r\n8. But in the meantime the petitioners were called upon to deposit non\u2212judicial stamp papers of the\r\nvalue of Rs.1,98,000\/\u2212 for the execution of the sale deed. They did so and a sale deed was in fact\r\nexecuted by the Court on 04.01.2017.\r\n9. It is only thereafter that the respondents filed an application in I.A No.142 of 2017 for\r\ncondonation of the delay of 862 days in seeking to set aside the ex\u2212parte decree. This application\r\nfiled on 19.09.2017 was dismissed by the trial Court by an order dated 28.11.2017, primarily on three\r\ngrounds namely: (i) that there was no proper explanation for the delay; (ii) that even the written\r\nstatement was not filed within the time stipulated in Order VIII, Rule 7; and (iii) and that after\r\nallowing even the execution to proceed ex\u2212parte and after having allowed the sale deed to be\r\nexecuted by the Executing Court, the respondents cannot seek condonation of the huge delay.\r\n10. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the petition to condone the delay in seeking to set aside the ex\u2212\r\nparte decree, the respondents filed a revision petition under Section 115 of the Code before the High\r\nCourt. Entertaining a doubt about the appointment of a guardian for the third defendant, the\r\nlearned Judge summoned the original records in the suit from the trial Court. Finding that I.A\r\nNo.981 of 2013 filed along with the plaint for the appointment of a guardian for the third defendant,was not properly dealt with and that there was no appointment of a guardian for the minor as\r\nrequired under Order XXXII, Rule 3, the learned Judge invoked the general power of\r\nsuperintendence under Article 227 of the Constitution and set aside the ex\u2212parte decree itself,\r\nwithout going into the question of delay and without examining whether there was sufficient cause\r\nfor condonation of delay. In order to ensure that the petitioners\/decree holders are not poorer after\r\na decree (or because of the decree), the learned Judge put the respondents on condition that they\r\nshould pay of Rs.2,50,000\/\u2212 as cost to the petitioners\u2212herein on or before 16.10.2020, as the\r\npetitioners\/decree holders had already deposited stamp papers of the value of Rs.1,98,000\/\u2212 and\r\ngot the sale deed executed.\r\n11. It appears that pursuant to the aforesaid order of the High Court, the respondents deposited the\r\ncost of Rs.2,50,000\/\u2212 on 12.10.2020. As a consequence, the trial Court appears to have taken up the\r\nsuit for trial after framing issues. It is stated by Mr. R. Balasubramanian, learned senior counsel for\r\nthe respondents that the suit now stands posted for examination of PW\u22121.\r\n12. The main grounds of attack, to the impugned order of the High Court, as articulated by Mr. S.\r\nNagamuthu, learned senior counsel for the petitioners are :\u2212 (i) that the High Court ought not to\r\nhave set aside an ex\u2212parte decree, in a revision petition arising out of an application under Section 5\r\nof the Limitation Act, 1963; (ii) that the Court was not even entitled to invoke equity in favour of the\r\nrespondents who were grossly negligent, first in defending the suit, next in defending the executing\r\nproceedings and then in seeking to set aside the ex\u2212parte decree after nearly a year of seeking to set\r\naside the ex\u2212parte order passed in the Execution Petition; and (iii) that it was not even one of the\r\ngrounds raised or points argued by the respondents\u2212herein in their revision petition before the High\r\nCourt either that the procedure prescribed under Order XXXII, Rule 3 of the Code was not followed\r\nor that a grave prejudice or injustice has been caused to the defendant\/minor, on account of the\r\nfailure, if any, on the part of the trial Court.\r\n13. Mr. R. Balasubramanian, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents contended in\r\nresponse, that the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 are wider in nature and\r\nthat when the High Court finds that the trial Court has not taken care of the interest of the minor\r\nwho was a party to the proceeding, by following the procedure prescribed by law, the High Court\r\ncannot shut its eyes on the basis of technicalities.\r\n14. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. There is no dispute on facts and there is no\r\nescape from the conclusion that the respondents have been grossly negligent in defending the suit as\r\nwell as the execution proceedings. But the fact remains that while the parties can afford to remain\r\nnegligent, the Court cannot. The High Court has found, after summoning the records from the trial\r\nCourt that as a matter of fact, the trial Court failed to appoint a guardian for the third\r\nrespondent\/minor in a manner prescribed by law. As pointed out earlier, an application was in fact\r\nfiled by the petitioners\u2212herein\/plaintiffs under Order XXXII, Rule 3 of the Code in I.A No.981 of\r\n2013. The said application was closed by the trial Court by an Order passed on 23.03.2014, which we\r\nhave extracted elsewhere. The manner in which the trial Court disposed of the application under\r\nOrder XXXII, Rule 3, is without doubt, improper and cannot at all be sustained, especially in the\r\nteeth of the Madras Amendment.15. Order XXXII, Rule 3, is found in the First Schedule to the Code. Under Section 121 of the Code,\r\nthe Rules in the First Schedule shall have effect as if enacted in the body of the Code until annulled\r\nor altered in accordance with the provisions of Part\u2212X, which comprises of Sections 121 to 131. The\r\nHigh Courts are empowered under Section 122 of the Code to annul\/alter or add to all or any of the\r\nRules in the First Schedule, for regulating the procedure of the civil courts subject to their\r\nsuperintendence.\r\n16. In exercise of such a power, the High Court of Judicature at Madras has made Rule 3 of Order\r\nXXXII of the Code, much more elaborate than how the Rule was originally framed.\r\n17. In the impugned order, the learned Judge has extracted Order XXXII, Rule 3 of the Code in its\r\noriginal form. But in its application to civil courts subject to the superintendence of the Madras High\r\nCourt Order XXXII, Rule 31 actually reads as follows:\u2212 `\u201D3. Qualifications to be a next friend or\r\nguardian. \u2013 (1) Any person who is of sound mind and has attained majority may act as next friend of\r\na minor or as his guardian for the suit:\r\nProvided that the interest of that person is not adverse to that of the minor and that\r\nhe is not in the case of a next friend, defendant, or in the case of a guardian for the\r\nsuit, a plaintiff.\r\n(2) Appointed or declared guardians to be preferred and to be superseded only for\r\nreasons recorded. \u2013 Where a minor has a guardian appointed or declared by\r\ncompetent authority no person other than the guardian shall act as the next friend of\r\nthe minor or be appointed his guardian for the suit unless the Court considers, for\r\nreasons to be recorded, that it is for the minor\u2019s welfare that another person be\r\npermitted to act or be appointed, as the case may be.\r\n(3) Guardians to be appointed by Court.\u2212 Where the defendant is a minor, the Court,\r\non being satisfied of the fact of his minority, shall appoint a proper person to be\r\nguardian for the suit for the minor.\r\n1 The amendment was made by a Notification in P. Dis. No.256 of 1938 Vide St. George Gazette,\r\ndated 13\u22123\u22121938. Unfortunately most of the Bare Acts published in recent times and even the 19 th\r\nEdition of Mulla on the Code of Civil Procedure does not make a mention of the Notification number\r\nand date in so far as the Madras Amendment is concerned.\r\n(3A) A person appointed under sub\u2212rule (3) to be guardian for the suit for a minor shall unless his\r\nappointment is terminated by retirement, removal or death continue as such throughout all\r\nproceedings arising out of the suit including proceedings in any appellate or revisional Court and\r\nany proceeding in execution of a decree.\r\n(4) Appointment to be on application and where necessary after notice to proposed guardian.\u2212 An\r\norder for the appointment of a guardian for the suit may be obtained upon application in the name\r\nand on behalf of the minor or by the Plaintiff. The application, where it is by the plaintiff, shall setforth, in the order of their suitability, a list of persons (with their full addresses for service of notice\r\nin Form No. 11A set forth in Appendix H. Hereto) who are competent and qualified to act as\r\nguardian for the suit for the minor defendant. The Court may, for reasons to be recorded in any\r\nparticular case, exempt the applicant from furnishing the list referred to above.\r\n(5) Contents of affidavit in support of the application for appointment of guardian.\u2212 The application\r\nreferred to in the above sub\u2212rule whether made by the plaintiff or on behalf of the minor defendant\r\nshall be supported by an affidavit verifying the fact that the proposed guardian has not or that no\r\none of the proposed guardians has any interest in the matters in controversy in the suit adverse to\r\nthat of the minor and that the proposed guardian or guardians are fit persons to be so appointed.\r\nThe affidavit shall further state according to the circumstances of each case (a) particulars of any\r\nexisting guardian appointed or declared by competent authority, (b) the name and address of the\r\nperson, if any, who is the de facto guardian of the minor, (c) the names and addresses of persons, if\r\nany, who in the event of either the natural or the de facto guardian or the guardian appointed or\r\ndeclared by competent authority, not being permitted to act, are by reason of relationship or interest\r\nor otherwise, suitable persons to act as guardians for the minor for the suit.\r\n(6) Application for appointment of guardian to be separate from application for bringing on record\r\nthe legal representatives of a deceased party. \u2013 An Application for the appointment of a guardian for\r\nthe suit of a minor shall not be combined with an application for bringing on record the legal\r\nrepresentatives of a deceased plaintiff or defendant. The applications shall be by separate petitions.\r\n(7) Notice of application to be given to persons interested in the minor defendant other than the\r\nproposed guardian.\u2013 No order shall be made on any application under sub\u2212rule (4) above except\r\nupon notice to any guardian of the minor appointed or declared by an authority competent in that\r\nbehalf or where there is no guardian, upon notice to the father or other natural guardian of the\r\nminor, or where there is no father or other natural guardian, to the person in whose care the minor\r\nis, and after hearing any objection which may be urged on behalf of any person served with notice\r\nunder this sub\u2212rule. The notice required by this sub\u2212rule shall be served six clear days before the\r\nday named in the notice for the hearing of the application and may be in Form No. 11 set forth in\r\nAppendix H hereto.\r\n(8) Special provision to shorten delay in getting a guardian appointed.\u2212Where the application is by\r\nthe plaintiff, he shall, along with his application and affidavit referred to in sub\u2212rules (4) and (5)\r\nabove, produce the necessary forms in duplicate filled in to the extent that is possible at that stage,\r\nfor the issue simultaneous of notices to two at least of the proposed guardians for the suit to be\r\nselected by the Court from the list referred to in sub\u2212rule (4) above together with a duly stamped\r\nvoucher indicating that the fees prescribed for service have been paid.\r\nIf one or more of the proposed guardians signify his or their consent to act, the Court shall appoint\r\none of them and intimate the fact of such appointment to the person appointed by registered post. If\r\nno one of the persons served signifies his consent to act, the Court shall proceed to serve\r\nsimultaneously another selected two, if so many there be, of the persons named in the list referred to\r\nin sub\u2212rule (4) above but no fresh application under sub\u2212rule (4) shall be deemed necessary. The\r\napplicant shall within three days of intimation of unwillingness by the first set of proposedguardians, pay the prescribed fee for service and produce the necessary forms duly filled in.\r\n(9) No personal shall be appointed guardian without his consent.\u2212 No person shall without his\r\nconsent, be appointed guardian for the suit. Whenever an application is made proposing the name\r\nof a person as guardian for the suit a notice in Form No.11 A set forth in Appendix H hereto shall be\r\nserved on the proposed guardian, unless the applicant himself be the proposed guardian or the\r\nproposed guardian consents.\r\n(10) Court guardian.\u2212 When to be appointed\u2212How he is to be placed in funds.\u2212 Where the Court\r\nfinds no person fit and willing to act as guardian for the suit, the Court may appoint any of its\r\nofficers or a pleader of the Court to be the guardian and may direct that the costs to be incurred by\r\nthat officer in the performance of the duties as guardian shall be borne either by the parties or by\r\nany one or more of the parties to the suit or out of any fund in Court in which the minor is\r\ninterested, and may give directions for the repayment or allowance of the costs as justice and the\r\ncircumstances of the case may require.\r\n(11) Funds for a guardian other than Court guardian to defend.\u2212 When a guardian for the suit of a\r\nminor defendant is appointed and it is made to appear to the Court that the guardian is not in\r\npossession of any or sufficient funds for the conduct of the suit on behalf of the defendant and that\r\nthe defendant will be prejudiced in his defence thereby, the Court may, from time to time, order the\r\nplaintiff to advance monies to the guardian for purpose of his defence and all monies so advanced\r\nshall form part of the costs of the plaintiff in the suit. The order shall direct that the guardians, as\r\nand when directed, shall file in Court an account of the monies so received by him.\u201D\r\n18. There is a great deal of difference between the Rules of Procedure laid down in Rule 3 of Order\r\nXXXII by the Central Act and Rule 3 as applicable to civil courts subject to the superintendence of\r\nMadras High Court. Order XXXII, Rule 3 in its original form reads as follows:\u2212 \u201C3. Guardian for the\r\nsuit to be appointed by court for minor defendant.\u2212 (1) Where the defendant is a minor, the court,\r\non being satisfied of the fact of his minority, shall appoint a proper person to be guardian for the suit\r\nfor such minor.\r\n(2) An order for the appointment of a guardian for the suit may be obtained upon application in the\r\nname and on behalf of the minor or by the plaintiff.\r\n(3) Such application shall be supported by an affidavit verifying the fact that the proposed guardian\r\nhas no interest in the matters in controversy in the suit adverse to that of the minor and that he is a\r\nfit person to be so appointed.\r\n(4) No order shall be made on any application under this rule except upon notice to any guardian of\r\nthe minor appointed or declared by an authority competent in that behalf, or, where there is no such\r\nguardian, upon notice to the father, or where there is no father, to the mother, or where there is no\r\nfather or mother, to other natural guardian of the minor, or, where there is no father, mother, or\r\nother natural guardian, to the person in whose care the minor is, and after hearing any objection\r\nwhich may be urged on behalf of any person served with notice under this sub\u2212rule. (4A) The Court\r\nmay, in any case, if it thinks fit, issue notice under sub\u2212rule (4) to the minor also.\r\n(5) A person appointed under sub\u2212rule (1) to be guardian for the suit for a minor shall, unless his\r\nappointment is terminated by retirement, removal or death, continue as such throughout all\r\nproceedings arising out of the suit including proceedings in any Appellate or Revisional Court and\r\nany proceedings in the execution of a decree.\u201D\r\n19. A comparison of the two sets of Rules show that the rules applicable to Courts subject to the\r\nsuperintendence of the Madras High Court are more elaborate and also rigorous. We may\r\nimmediately note (i) that sub\u2212rules (1) and (2) of Rule 3 of the Rules applicable to Courts subject to\r\nthe superintendence of the Madras High Court (hereinafter referred to as \u201Capplicable rules\u201D for the\r\npurpose of convenience), are additional requirements; (ii) that sub\u2212 rule (3) of Rule 3 of the\r\n\u2018applicable rules\u2019 is a reproduction of sub\u2212 rule (1) of Rule 3 of the original Code; (iii) that sub\u2212rule\r\n(3\u2212A) of Rule 3 of the \u2018applicable rules\u2019 is a reproduction of sub\u2212rule (5) of the Central Act; (iv) sub\u2212\r\nrule (7) of Rule 3 of the \u2018applicable rules\u2019 is an improved version of sub\u2212rule (4) of Rule 3 of the\r\nCentral Act.\r\n20. More importantly sub\u2212rules (4), (5), (6) and a part of sub\u2212rule (7) of Rule 3 of Order XXXII of\r\nthe \u2018applicable rules\u2019 prescribe certain additional requirements which are as follows:\u2212 (i) when an\r\napplication for the appointment of a guardian is by the plaintiff, it shall set forth in the order of their\r\nsuitability, a list of persons with their full addresses for service of notice in Form No.11\u2212A set forth\r\nin Appendix H, who are competent and qualified to act as guardian for the minor defendant; (ii) the\r\napplication for appointment of a guardian should be supported by an affidavit, not merely verifying\r\n(as in the Central Act) the fact that the proposed guardian has no interest in the matters in\r\ncontroversy adverse to that of the minor, but also stating additional particulars including the name\r\nand address of the de\u2212facto guardian and the names and addresses of other suitable persons,\r\nwhenever a natural or de\u2212facto guardian is not permitted to act.\r\n21. Admittedly, the learned Judge summoned the records from the trial Court after entertaining a\r\ndoubt about the procedure followed by the trial Court in this case and found as a matter of fact that\r\nthe trial Court failed to appoint a guardian for the third defendant as required by Order XXXII, Rule\r\n3. The power of the learned Judge to call for the records and examine the same, in a revision under\r\nSection 115(1) of the Code is not and cannot be doubted or questioned by the petitioners. It is true\r\nthat the learned Judge was dealing only with a revision petition arising out of an Order dismissing a\r\npetition under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. But it does not take away or curtail the\r\njurisdiction of the High Court to look into the records with particular reference to an important rule\r\nof procedure, especially when the same relates to something concerning persons under disability.\r\nThe rigorous nature of the Madras amendment to Rule 3 of Order XXXII, is perhaps to be attributed\r\nto the wider jurisdiction that the High Court exercised on its original side, under Clause\u221217 of the\r\nLetters Patent and the parens patriae jurisdiction that a Court normally exercises while dealing with\r\ncases of minors. Therefore, we find no illegality in the action of the High Court in summoning the\r\noriginal records in the suit and finding out whether or not a guardian of a minor defendant was\r\nappointed properly in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Order XXXII, Rule 3, even in the\r\nabsence of a specific contention being raised by the petitioners.\r\n22. The contention that in a revision arising out of the dismissal of a petition under Section 5 of the\r\nLimitation Act, 1963, the High Court cannot set aside the ex\u2212parte decree itself, by invoking the\r\npower under Article 227, does not appeal to us. It is too well settled that the powers of the High\r\nCourt under Article 227 are in addition to and wider than the powers under Section 115 of the Code.\r\nIn Surya Dev Rai vs. Ram Chander Rai and Others 2, this Court went as far as to hold that even\r\ncertiorari under Article 226 can be issued for correcting gross errors of jurisdiction of a subordinate\r\nCourt. But the correctness of the said view in so far as it related to Article 226, was doubted by\r\nanother Bench, which resulted in a reference to a three member Bench. In Radhey Shyam & Anr. vs.\r\nChhabi Nath & Others3, the three member Bench, even while overruling Surya Dev Rai (supra) on\r\nthe question of jurisdiction under Article 226, pointed out that the jurisdiction under Article 227 is\r\ndistinguishable. Therefore, we do not agree with the contention that the High Court committed an\r\nerror of jurisdiction in invoking Article 227 and setting aside the ex\u2212parte decree.\r\n23. In fact the learned Judge also went into the question whether a decree passed against a minor\r\nwithout proper appointment of a 2 (2003) 6 SCC 675 3 (2015) 5 SCC 423 guardian, is a nullity ipso\r\nfacto or whether the same would depend upon prejudice against the minor being established. The\r\nlearned Judge found that in this case, the minor was prejudiced.\r\n24. It may be of interest to note that Rule 3\u2212A was inserted in Order XXXII by CPC Amendment Act\r\n104 of 1976. It is this Rule that introduced for the first time into the Code, the question of prejudice\r\nto the minor. But this Rule 3\u2212A applies only to cases where the next friend or guardian for the suit of\r\nthe minor had an interest in the subject matter of the suit adverse to that of the minor. This\r\namendment was a sequel to certain conflicting opinions on the question as to whether a decree\r\npassed in cases where the minor was represented by a guardian who had an interest in the subject\r\nmatter of the suit adverse to that of the minor, was void or voidable.\r\n25. In other words the Parliament chose to introduce the element of prejudice, specifically in\r\nrelation to one category of cases under Order XXXII, Rule 3A. The case on hand does not fall under\r\nthat category. In any case, we need not go into that question in this case, as the learned Judge found\r\nthat the minor was prejudiced.\r\n26. A valiant attempt was made during the hearing, to show that the 3rd Respondent\/defendant was\r\nnot a minor at all. Such a contention was sought to be raised on the basis of the long cause title in\r\nthe execution application E.A.No.65 of 2017 where the 3 rd Respondent was described as a person\r\naged about 24 years in the year 2017. Therefore, it was sought to be contended that he should have\r\nattained majority long before the ex parte decree and that therefore the question of appointment of a\r\nguardian and the decree becoming a nullity did not arise.\r\n27. The said contention is to be stated only to be rejected. It was the petitioners herein who filed the\r\nsuit in the year 2013 describing the 3rd defendant as a minor and seeking the appointment of a\r\nguardian. Therefore, there is no place for any innovative arguments contrary to one\u2019s own pleadings.\r\n28. Another contention was raised that in any event, the decree could have been set aside only as\r\nagainst the 3 rd Respondent and not against all the others. But the said logic does not apply to\r\nsomething that is a nullity in law.\r\n29. The reliance placed by the learned counsel for the petitioners upon the judgment of a Division\r\nBench of the Madras High Court in Lanka Sanyasi vs. Lanka Yerran Naidu4 is misplaced. The\r\nquestion in Lanka Sanyasi (supra) was whether a person who had become a major on the date on\r\nwhich a compromise decree was passed in a suit, was entitled to challenge the compromise decree in\r\na subsequent suit. The subsequent suit was decreed by the First Appellate Court and while dealing\r\nwith the Second Appeal, the High Court held in Lanka Sanyasi that a mere circumstance that a\r\nminor defendant had attained majority during the pendency of the suit, but not elected to continue\r\nthe defence himself and to have his guardian ad litem discharged, is not sufficient to enable him to\r\nhave the judgment passed in the suit declared as not binding on him. Nothing turned on the\r\nprovisions of Order XXXII, Rule 3 in the said case.\r\n30. The decision of the Travancore Cochin High Court in Ouseph Joseph vs. Thoma Eathamma5,\r\nrelied upon by the petitioners, 4 1929 Law Weekly 455 5 AIR 1956 TC 26 more than helping the\r\npetitioners, confirms that the view taken in the impugned order is correct.\r\n31. The decision in Divya Dip Singh and others vs. Ram Bachan Mishra and others6, concerned the\r\nquestion whether the appointment of a guardian for a minor under Order XXXII, Rule 3 will take\r\naway the right of the natural guardian. The answer was too obvious and the same has nothing to do\r\nwith the issue on hand.\r\n32. The decision of the Rajasthan High Court in Anandram and another vs. Madholal and others7\r\nrelied upon by the petitioners, dealt with the question of prejudice to the minor, specially in the\r\ncontext of the father filing a written statement on behalf of the minors and admitting receipt of part\r\nconsideration. In Rangammal vs. Minor Appasami8 there was a finding on fact that the minor\u2019s\r\ninterests were sufficiently safeguarded in the suit. Therefore, none of these decisions relied upon by\r\nthe petitioners, advance their cause.\r\n6 (1997) 1 SCC 504 7 AIR 1960 Raj 189 8 85 Law Weekly 574\r\n33. Therefore, we find no illegality in the order of the High Court warranting our interference under\r\nArticle 136. Hence, this Special Leave Petition is dismissed.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..J.

          "judgement":"A.S. Bopanna,J.\r\n1. The appellant is before this Court assailing the judgment dated 18.08.2010 passed by the High\r\nCourt of Karnataka in Criminal Appeal No. 485 of 2008. By the said judgment, the Learned Single\r\nJudge has allowed the appeal filed by the respondent herein and set aside the judgment of acquittal\r\npassed by the IIIrd Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division) and JMFC, Udupi in favour of the\r\nappellant herein in Criminal Case No. 3207 of 2004. Consequently, the appellant herein was\r\nconvicted and sentenced to pay compensation of Rs.4,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees four lakhs) within four\r\nmonths. In default thereto, the appellant was sentenced to simple imprisonment for a period of six\r\nmonths. The appellant was further ordered to pay a fine of Rs.5,000\/\u2212 to the State, in default, to\r\nundergo simple imprisonment for a period of 15 days. The appellant therefore is claiming to be\r\naggrieved by the judgment impugned herein.\r\n2. The factual matrix, in brief, is that the appellant and the respondent are known to each other.\r\nBoth of them hail from Udupi in Karnataka. The respondent filed a private complaint under Section\r\n2(d) read with Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u2018Cr.PC\u2019 for short) against the\r\nappellant seeking that he be punished for committing the offence punishable under Section 138 ofthe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (\u2018NI Act\u2019 for short). The complaint was filed on 17.03.2004\r\nbefore the II Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division) and JMFC, Udupi in P.C. No. 213 of 2004\r\nwhich was thereafter registered as CC No. 3207 of 2004. It was the case of the respondent that the\r\nappellant carried on the business of money lending and land brokerage for which he used to take\r\nloan from the respondent as and when required. In one such transaction, as per the case put forth by\r\nthe respondent is that the appellant borrowed a sum of Rs. 3,75,000\/\u2212 (Rupees three lakh seventy\u2212\r\nfive thousand) from the respondent on 12.06.2003 and executed an \u2018on demand promissory note\u2019\r\nand a receipt in acknowledgment. The appellant also issued a post\u2212dated cheque bearing No.\r\n062589 for Rs. 4,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees four lakhs) dated 12.12.2003, which included interest for six\r\nmonths. The said cheque was drawn on Corporation Bank, Ambalpady Branch, Udupi.\r\n3. As per the case of the respondent, when the cheque was presented for realisation on 17.02.2004,\r\nthe same was dishonoured by the bank for \u201Cinsufficient funds\u201D in the account of the appellant.\r\nHaving got issued a legal notice dated 18.02.2004 and on the demand for payment of\r\nRs.4,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees four lakhs) not being complied, the respondent filed the complaint in the\r\njurisdictional court, the details of which is referred to supra. The appellant however came out with\r\nthe defence that though he had borrowed an amount of Rs.80,000\/\u2212 from the respondent in the\r\nyear 1995, the same was repaid with interest, amounting to Rs.3,20,000\/\u2212 (Rupees three lakh\r\ntwenty thousand) through various cheques and there was no further amount due and payable. The\r\nappellant therefore denied that he had taken any loan on 12.06.2003, as alleged. It was the further\r\ncase of the appellant that the respondent had assaulted and threatened him on 20.01.2004 and by\r\nforce had obtained his signatures on blank papers as also on some cheque leaves which were being\r\nmisused. The appellant had in that regard lodged a complaint on 02.02.2004, the trial of which was\r\nheld in the Court of Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division) and JMFC, Udupi in CC No.\r\n6318\/2004. However, admittedly the respondent herein was acquitted in the said proceedings,\r\nthrough the judgment dated 06.12.2006 which has attained finality.\r\n4. In order to contend that the complaint filed by the respondent alleging dishonour of cheque was\r\nmotivated, the appellant alleged that as he had incurred debts, he decided to sell one of the\r\nproperties belonging to him, which was purchased in the year 1994, so as to clear the said debts. The\r\nrespondent evinced interest to purchase the same for Rs.3,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees three lakh) but the\r\nappellant declined to sell it to the respondent as according to him, the said property was worth more\r\nthan Rs.7,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees seven lakh). The appellant alleged that the respondent had therefore\r\nfiled the instant complaint, based on false allegations.\r\n5. On the rival contentions, the learned trial Judge raised the point for consideration, as to whether\r\nthe respondent herein had proved that the cheque dated 12.12.2003 for Rs. 4,00,000\/ (Rupees four\r\nlakh) was issued by the appellant to discharge the legal debt or liability and thereby committed the\r\noffence punishable under Section 138 N.I Act. The learned trial Judge having accepted the version\r\nput forth by the appellant passed an order of acquittal. The learned Judge of the High Court, has on\r\nthe other hand, accepted the case of the respondent herein and taking into account the presumption\r\nthat had arisen on the cheque being issued and such presumption not being rebutted for the reasons\r\nindicated by it, has allowed the appeal and convicted the appellant which has resulted in this appeal.6. We have heard Mr. S.N. Bhat, learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. Ranji Thomas, learned\r\nsenior counsel with Mr. V.N. Raghupathy, learned counsel for the respondent and perused the\r\nappeal papers.\r\n7. From the rival contentions urged before us and the facts which emerge from the records, it is clear\r\nthat cheque bearing No.062589 dated 12.12.2003 drawn on Corporation Bank, Ambalpady Branch,\r\nUdupi for the sum of Rs. 4,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees four lakh), which is the subject matter of the\r\ncomplaint in CC No.3207 of 2004, has been brought on record. However, in the light of the defence\r\nthat was raised, the point which arises for consideration is as to whether the said cheque was in fact\r\nissued by the appellant on 12.06.2003 by post\u2212dating it to 12.12.2003 and making it payable on or\r\nafter that date, towards discharge of a legal debt.\r\n8. The legal aspect relating to the presumption arising in law when a cheque is issued, is to be noted\r\nat the threshold. No doubt, as noted by the trial court with reference to the decision of this Court in\r\nK.Prakashan vs. P.K. Surendran (2008) 1 SCC 258, the initial burden is placed on the complainant\r\nto discharge. Learned counsel for the appellant has further relied on the decision of this Court in\r\nReverend Mother Marykutty vs. Reni C. Kottaram & Anr. (2013) 1 SCC 327 with reference to para\r\n13, which reads as hereunder;\r\n\u201C13. That apart, having considered the conclusions of the learned trial Judge, we find that those\r\nconclusions were drawn by adducing cogent and convincing reasoning and we do not find any fault\r\nin the said conclusions drawn by the learned trial Judge. In the circumstance, the principles set out\r\nin the decision relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant in M.S. Narayana Menon as\r\nregards the presumption to be drawn and the preponderance of probabilities to be inferred, as set\r\nout in paras 31 to 33, are fully satisfied. Those principles, set out in paras 31 to 33, can be usefully\r\nreferred to which are as under:\r\n\u201C31. A Division Bench of this Court in Bharat Barrel & Drum Mfg. Co. v. Amin Chand\r\nPayrelal albeit in a civil case laid down the law in the following terms:\r\n(SCC PP.50-51 para 12) \u201812. Upon consideration of various judgments as noted\r\nhereinabove, the position of law which emerges is that once execution of the\r\npromissory note is admitted, the presumption under Section 118(a) would arise that\r\nit is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable. The defendant\r\ncan prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a probable defence. If the\r\ndefendant is proved to have discharged the initial onus of proof showing that the\r\nexistence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same was illegal, the\r\nonus would shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and\r\nupon its failure to prove would disentitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the\r\nnegotiable instrument. The burden upon the defendant of proving the non-existence\r\nof the consideration can be either direct or by bringing on record the preponderance\r\nof probabilities by reference to the circumstances upon which he relies. In such an\r\nevent, the plaintiff is entitled under law to rely upon all the evidence led in the case\r\nincluding that of the plaintiff as well. In case, where the defendant fails to discharge\r\nthe initial onus of proof by showing the non- existence of the consideration, the\r\nplaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of presumption arising under\r\nSection 118(a) in his favour. The court may not insist upon the defendant to disprove\r\nthe existence of consideration by leading direct evidence as the existence of negative\r\nevidence is neither possible nor contemplated and even if led, is to be seen with a\r\ndoubt.\u2019 This Court, therefore, clearly opined that it is not necessary for the defendant\r\nto disprove the existence of consideration by way of direct evidence.\r\n32. The standard of proof evidently is preponderance of probabilities. Inference of\r\npreponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials on record\r\nbut also by reference to the circumstances upon which he relies.\r\n33. Presumption drawn under a statute has only an evidentiary value. Presumptions\r\nare raised in terms of the Evidence Act.\r\nPresumption drawn in respect of one fact may be evidence even for the purpose of drawing\r\npresumption under another.\u201D Applying the abovesaid principles to the case on hand, we find that the\r\njudgment of the trial court in having drawn the conclusions to the effect that the appellant\r\nsufficiently rebutted the initial presumption as regards the issuance of the cheque under Sections\r\n138 and 139 of the Act, was perfectly justified. We also find that the preponderance of probabilities\r\nalso fully supports the stand of the appellant as held by the learned trial Judge. The judgment of the\r\nHigh Court in having interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Judge without\r\nproper reasoning is, therefore, liable to be set aside and is accordingly set aside.\r\nConsequently, the conviction and sentence imposed in the impugned judgment [ Criminal Appeal\r\nNo. 1707 of 2007, order dated 17-3- 2010 (Ker)] is also set aside.\u201D\r\n9. The learned senior counsel for the respondent on the other hand, relied on the decision of this\r\nCourt in Kalamani Tex & Anr. vs. P. Balasubramanian (2021) 5 SCC 283 which is as hereunder: \u2212\r\n\u201C16. The appellants have banked upon the evidence of DW 1 to dispute the existence of any\r\nrecoverable debt. However, his deposition merely highlights that the respondent had an\r\nover-extended credit facility with the bank and his failure to update his account led to debt recovery\r\nproceedings. Such evidence does not disprove the appellants' liability and has a little bearing on the\r\nmerits of the respondent's complaint. Similarly, the appellants' mere bald denial regarding\r\ngenuineness of the deed of undertaking dated 7-11-2000, despite admitting the signatures of\r\nAppellant 2 thereupon, does not cast any doubt on the genuineness of the said document.\r\n17. Even if we take the arguments raised by the appellants at face value that only a blank cheque and\r\nsigned blank stamp papers were given to the respondent, yet the statutory presumption cannot be\r\nobliterated. It is useful to cite Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar [Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar, where this\r\nCourt held that: (SCC p. 209, para 36) \u201C36. Even a blank cheque leaf, voluntarily signed and handed\r\nover by the accused, which is towards some payment, would attract presumption under Section 139\r\nof the Negotiable Instruments Act, in the absence of any cogent evidence to show that the cheque\r\nwas not issued in discharge of a debt.\u201D18. Considering the fact that there has been an admitted business relationship between the parties,\r\nwe are of the opinion that the defence raised by the appellants does not inspire confidence or meet\r\nthe standard of \u201Cpreponderance of probability\u201D. In the absence of any other relevant material, it\r\nappears to us that the High Court did not err in discarding the appellants' defence and upholding\r\nthe onus imposed upon them in terms of Section 118 and Section 139 of NIA.\r\n19. As regards the claim of compensation raised on behalf of the respondent, we are conscious of the\r\nsettled principles that the object of Chapter XVII of NIA is not only punitive but also compensatory\r\nand restitutive. The provisions of NIA envision a single window for criminal liability for dishonour\r\nof cheque as well as civil liability for realisation of the cheque amount. It is also well settled that\r\nthere needs to be a consistent approach towards awarding compensation and unless there exist\r\nspecial circumstances, the courts should uniformly levy fine up to twice the cheque amount along\r\nwith simple interest @ 9% p.a.\r\n10. It would also be apposite to take note of a decision in Triyambak S. Hegde vs. Sripad in Criminal\r\nAppeal Nos.849\u2212850 of 2011 dated 23.09.2021 wherein it was observed as hereunder:\r\n\u201C12. Insofar as the payment of the amount by the appellant in the context of the\r\ncheque having been signed by the respondent, the presumption for passing of the\r\nconsideration would arise as provided under Section 118(a) of N.I. Act which reads as\r\nhereunder: \u2212 \u201C118. Presumptions as to negotiable instruments \u2013 Until the contrary is\r\nproved, the following presumptions shall be made: \u2212\r\n(a) of consideration \u2013 that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for\r\nconsideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed,\r\nnegotiated or transferred, was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for\r\nconsideration.\u201D\r\n13. The above noted provisions are explicit to the effect that such presumption would\r\nremain, until the contrary is proved. The learned counsel for the appellant in that\r\nregard has relied on the decision of this court in K. Bhaskaran vs. Sankaran Vaidhyan\r\nBalan & Anr.\r\n(1999) 7 SCC 510 wherein it is held as hereunder: \u2212 \u201C9. As the signature in the cheque is admitted to\r\nbe that of the accused, the presumption envisaged in Section 118 of the Act can legally be inferred\r\nthat the cheque was made or drawn for consideration on the date which the cheque bears. Section\r\n139 of the Act enjoins on the Court to presume that the holder of the cheque received it for the\r\ndischarge of any debt or liability. The burden was on the accused to rebut the aforesaid\r\npresumption.\r\nThe Trial Court was not persuaded to rely on the interested testimony of DW\u22121 to rebut the\r\npresumption. The said finding was upheld by the High Court. It is not now open to the accused to\r\ncontend differently on that aspect.\u201D\r\n14. The learned counsel for the respondent has however referred to the decision of this Court in\r\nBasalingappa vs. Mudibasappa (2019) 5 SCC 418 wherein it is held as hereunder: \u2212 \u201C25. We having\r\nnoticed the ratio laid down by this Court in the above cases on Sections 118 (a) and 139, we now\r\nsummarise the principles enumerated by this Court in following manner:\r\n25.1. Once the execution of cheque is admitted Section 139 of the Act mandates a\r\npresumption that the cheque was for the discharge of any debt or other liability.\r\n25.2. The presumption under Section 139 is a rebuttable presumption and the onus is\r\non the accused to raise the probable defence. The standard of proof for rebutting the\r\npresumption is that of preponderance of probabilities.\r\n25.3. To rebut the presumption, it is open for the accused to rely on evidence led by\r\nhim or the accused can also rely on the materials submitted by the complainant in\r\norder to raise a probable defence.\r\nInference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials brought on\r\nrecord by the parties but also by reference to the circumstances upon which they rely.\r\n25.4. That it is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box in support of his defence,\r\nSection 139 imposed an evidentiary burden and not a persuasive burden.\r\n25.5. It is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box to support his defence.\u201D\r\n11. The position of law as noted above makes it crystal clear that when a cheque is drawn out and is\r\nrelied upon by the drawee, it will raise a presumption that it is drawn towards a consideration which\r\nis a legally recoverable amount; such presumption of course, is rebuttable by proving to the\r\ncontrary. The onus is on the accused to raise a probable defence and the standard of proof for\r\nrebutting the presumption is on preponderance of probabilities.\r\n12. In the backdrop of the legal position being enunciated, the facts herein are to be noted. It was the\r\ncase of the respondent herein that the appellant had borrowed the sum of Rs.3,75,000\/\u2212 (Rupees\r\nthree lakh seventy\u2212five thousand) on 12.06.2003 which was agreed to be repaid with interest in six\r\nmonths. Hence, cheque No.062589 dated 12.12.2003 for Rs.4,00,000\/\u2212 (Rupees four lakh) drawn\r\non Corporation Bank was issued. It is true that the respondent had relied on an \u2018on demand\r\npromissory note\u2019 and had stated that one Mr. Harish Moolya was also present. The said Mr. Harish\r\nMoolya who had also signed as witness to the \u2018on demand promissory note\u2019 was not examined as a\r\nwitness due to which the learned trial Judge held the transaction as not proved and in that context it\r\nwas held that the respondent has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. However, it is to\r\nbe noted that the respondent had tendered evidence relating to the cheque being issued and had\r\ndischarged the initial burden.\r\n13. The entire consideration by the learned Trial Judge to arrive at his conclusion was predicated on\r\nthe allegation levelled by the appellant that an incident had occurred on 20.01.2004 when therespondent is stated to have obtained the cheque and signatures on certain blank papers by using\r\nforce. Much is made about the respondent having presented the cheque during February 2004 to\r\nassume that he would not have waited that long if the cheque was really dated 12.12.2003 and was\r\nissued earlier. Such an assumption would not be justified when, in fact, the cheque is dated\r\n12.12.2003 and was presented within its period of validity. To assume the incident alleged by the\r\nappellant to have occurred on 20.01.2004 to be true, the cheque ought to have been dated on or\r\nafter 20.01.2004. The date of presentation of the cheque is of no consequence provided it is\r\npresented within its validity period. That the alleged offence had been committed by the respondent\r\non 20.01.2004 itself, was considered in C.C. No.6318\/2004. When a jurisdictional Court had gone\r\ninto the very same allegation and had rendered its judgment on 06.12.2006, another court\r\nexercising co\u2212ordinate jurisdiction could not have brushed it aside lightly.\r\n14. The learned Judge of the High Court also referred to the earlier proceedings only as a passing\r\nreference. In the instant case, what needs to be noted is the defence that had been put forth before\r\nthe learned Magistrate to defeat the case of the respondent herein, so as to consider whether such\r\ncontention of the appellant can still be considered as a probable defence. The defence put forth by\r\nthe appellant in the instant case i.e., Section 138 NI Act proceedings in C.C. No.3207 of 2004 as\r\nreferred to by the learned Magistrate in the course of the judgment, reads as hereunder: \u2212 \u201CIt is\r\nfurther alleged that during the year 2003, in order to clear off the dues to some others, the accused\r\nhas decided to sell the above referred property and the accused expressed his desire to sell his\r\nproperty before the complainant. At that time, the complainant proposed to purchase the said\r\nproperty from the accused for Rs.3,00,000\/, but the accused has refused to sell the said property to\r\nthe complainant for the above said amount of Rs.3,00,000\/- since, the property is worth Rs. 7 lakh.\r\nIn view of the proposal made by the complainant for small amount, the accused is declined to sell\r\nhis property to him. Thereafter, the accused himself began to search the customers for purchasing\r\nthe said property at that time the complainant mislead the proposed purchasers who are ready to\r\npurchase the said property representing that the said property was pledged by the accused for the\r\npurpose of loan which was obtained by the accused from the finance of the complainant and\r\naccordingly, the purchasers who are come forward to purchase the same refused to purchase the\r\nsaid property thereby, the accused transferred some of the portion of the said property to his\r\ncreditors and some of the portion was transferred in the name of his wife. When facts stood thus, on\r\n20.1.04, when the accused went to taluk office at Udupi with his bike, the complainant chased the\r\naccused in his Maruthi Omni Van and thereafter, kidnapped the accused and took him to his office\r\nwhich was situated at Sri. Rama Building at Udupi, wherein the complainant wrongfully restrained\r\nthe accused and assaulted him with hands and also with iron rods and forcibly obtained various\r\nsignatures on some blank papers and also on some cheque leaves only with an intention to knock off\r\nthe property of the accused. It is further alleged that at that time the complainant warned the\r\naccused to get some papers from the wife of the accused since the property was stands in the name\r\nof the wife of the accused. At that time the complainant further threatened that he will finish the life\r\nof the accused as well as wife and children of the accused, if the said alleged act is intimated by the\r\naccused to the police. Thereafter the said incident, the complainant appointed the paid goondas to\r\nwatch the activities of the accused and the said goonda people also always watched the activities of\r\nthe accused nearby the compound of the accused, thereby, there was delay in lodging the complaint\r\nand accordingly, the accused herein lodged the complaint against the complainant on 2.2.04 nearlyafter lapse of 12 days from the date of incident. It is further alleged that the complainant is having\r\ncriminal mind and he has got every criminal background and also faced various criminal charges\r\nlike offences punishable u\/s. 302 and 326 of IPC and also engaged in Criminal activities amongst\r\nthose, this incident is also one of the charge faced by the accused. It is further alleged that the\r\naccused never issued the cheque in question voluntary and the same was obtained by the\r\ncomplainant by force and accordingly, the case was registered against the complainant for the\r\noffences punishable u\/s. 365, 342, 323 and 506 of IPC and accordingly, the cheque in question and\r\nsome other documents also misused by the complainant against the accused. In the light of the\r\nabove said defence, the accused humbly prayed for acquittal.\u201D\r\n15. A close perusal of the above indicates that the sum and substance of the defence is that the\r\ndocuments and cheque had been obtained by the respondent on 20.01.2004 by threatening the\r\nappellant. In that regard, the circumstances thereto were referred and it has been categorically\r\nstated that the appellant had filed a complaint, pursuant to which a case was registered against the\r\nrespondent for the offence punishable under Sections 365, 342, 323 and 506 of IPC. This makes it\r\nrelevant for us to take note of the aspect that was considered in the above noted criminal complaint\r\nfiled by the appellant. The said case was registered as C.C. No.6318 of 2004. In that case, the learned\r\nMagistrate, on taking note of the allegation made by the appellant, had raised the points for\r\nconsideration and the findings were summarised. They are as follows: \u2212 \u201C5. Heard both sides and\r\nperused the record. Now, the points that arise for the due consideration of this Court are as follows:\r\n\u2212 (1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubts that on 20.1.2004 at about 11\r\np.m. within the jurisdiction of Udupi Town PS at Shivalli i.e. inside Svitha Finance, having old\r\nhatred, the accused locked up CW1 K.S. Rangnathan inside the said finance, thereby wrongfully\r\nconfined CW1 committed the offence punishable U\/s. 342 of IPC?\r\n(2) Whether the prosecution further proves beyond all reasonable doubts that on the same date,\r\nplace and time, the accused in continuation voluntarily assaulted with his hands on the face, neck\r\nand other parts of the body of CWl and thereby committed the offence punishable U\/s. 323 of IPC?\r\n(3) Whether the prosecution further proves beyond all reasonable doubts that on the same date,\r\nplace and time, the accused in continuation threatened the life of CWl, his wife and children if CWl\r\nwill not return the loan amount within the prescribed time and thereby committed the offence\r\npunishable U\/s. Part II of 506 of IPC.\r\n(4) What order?\r\n6. Now the findings of this Court on the above said points that arisen for due consideration are\r\nanswered as follows:\u2212 Point No. 1 : In the Negative Point No. 2: In the Negative Point No. 3: In the\r\nNegative Point No. 4: As per final order for the following:\u201D\r\n16. To arrive at the negative findings on the points raised, the learned Magistrate has assigned\r\ndetailed reasons and has arrived at the conclusion that the evidence of the complainant in respect of\r\nthe incident alleged to have taken place near the Taluk office, is not at all acceptable and therefore\r\nthe prosecution has failed. Further, though an investigation was conducted in the said proceedings\r\nand the trial had proceeded, no material objects had been seized, which has been commented upon\r\nby the learned Magistrate. The same would indicate that the cheques and other documents relied\r\nupon in the present proceedings, were not found to be created by threatening the appellant, as\r\nalleged. The Court had therefore arrived at the conclusion that the prosecution had miserably failed\r\nto prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts against the accused for the alleged offences. The said\r\nfinding and conclusion arrived at in the relevant proceedings would indicate that the incident\r\nalleged to have occurred on 20.01.2004, was not proved to have taken place.\r\n17. If that be the position, the defence sought to be put forth in the instant case and the witnesses\r\nexamined in the instant proceedings are only by way of improvement in respect of the same cause of\r\naction. Therefore, the defence sought to be put forth relating to the cheque and other documents\r\nhaving been obtained by force, cannot be accepted as a probable defence when the respondent\r\nsuccessfully discharged the initial burden cast on him of establishing that the cheque signed by the\r\nappellant was issued in his favour toward discharge of a legally recoverable amount. The fact that\r\nthe appellant has admitted about an earlier transaction where according to him, he had borrowed\r\nthe amount and repaid the same in the year 1995, would indicate that the appellant and the\r\nrespondent had entered into financial transactions earlier as well and another transaction was\r\nprobable between the parties who were known to each other. In the light of the other circumstances\r\nestablished by the respondent, it would indicate that the respondent had discharged the burden of\r\nproving that the transaction had actually taken place. To rebut the same, the very case put forth by\r\nthe appellant cannot be accepted as probable defence since the said aspect had already been\r\nconsidered in a separate proceeding (C.C.No.6318\/2004) and the respondent had been acquitted in\r\nthe said proceedings.\r\n18. Hence, the conclusion reached by the learned Magistrate in C.C. No.3207\/2004 to acquit the\r\nappellant herein, was not justified. The learned Single Judge of the High Court was therefore\r\njustified in his conclusion though detailed reasons have not been assigned. In that view, we see no\r\nreason to interfere with the judgment dated 18.08.2010, passed by the High Court in Criminal\r\nAppeal No.485\/2008, impugned in this appeal.\r\n19. Accordingly, the appeal being devoid of merit stands dismissed. The parties shall bear their own\r\ncosts.\r\n20. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.\r\n\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.CJI.\r\n(N.V. RAMANA) ..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

          "judgement":"Rastogi, J.\r\n1. The instant appeals have been preferred against the judgment and order dated 4th January, 2010\r\nsetting aside the Award passed by the Industrial Tribunal dated 14th November, 2005 answering the\r\nreference in affirmative terms holding the termination of the appellants-workmen to be void being\r\nin violation of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947(hereinafter being referred to as the\r\n\u201CAct 1947\u201D) with a direction of treating the workmen deemed to be in service till their services are\r\nvalidly terminated with 50% back wages.\r\n2. The brief facts culled out and relevant for the purpose are that the 1st respondent-University was\r\nestablished by an Ordinance viz. Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit Ordinance, 1993. The\r\nappointments of non-teaching staff in different categories, viz., Watchman, Attenders, Peons,\r\nSweepers, Assistant Cooks, Assistant Matrons, Drivers, Helpers, Waiters, Gardeners, Clerical\r\nAssistants were made at different points of time on daily wage basis during the period 1993-1995\r\nunder the orders of the then Vice Chancellor.\r\n3. Their services came to be regularized by the 1st respondent giving them the status of regular\r\nemployees by an order dated 7 th May, 1996. It appears that as some objections were raised\r\nquestioning the manner in which the regularisation had taken place, the 1st respondent by a later\r\norder dated 24th March, 1997 de- regularised the non-teaching staff\/employees and in consequence\r\nthereof, their services came to be terminated. So far as the order of de-regularisation passed by the\r\n1st respondent dated 24th March, 1997 is concerned, it has attained finality after the Division Bench\r\nof the High Court of Kerala has upheld the order of de-regularisation dated 24th March, 1997 taking\r\nnote of the initial engagement as daily wager and the appointment being without going through the\r\nprocess of selection as prescribed under the scheme of University Ordinance recorded a finding that\r\nthe order of de-regularisation passed by the authorities is valid and justified and left the question of\r\nnon- observance of the provisions of the Act 1947 open to be examined in the appropriate\r\nproceedings known to law.\r\n4. It may be further noticed that the grievance of the teaching and non-teaching staff was jointly\r\nexamined by the Division Bench of the High Court while deciding the writ appeal under its common\r\nimpugned judgment dated 23rd March, 2000. Para 10 of the judgment of the Division Bench of the\r\nHigh Court dated 23 rd March, 2000 relevant for the purpose is reproduced as under:-\r\n10. Other point raised related to non-observance of the requirements of the ID Act.\r\nAs rightly observed by learned single Judge, same is not to be decided in Article 226\r\napplications since appellants, if they are so advised and feel that they have a right\r\nunder the ID Act, can approach the forum. This position was highlighted by apex\r\nCourt in Basant Kumar Sarkar and Others Vs. Eagle Rolling Mills Ltd.(AIR 1954 SC\r\n1200) and Rajasthan State Road Transport Corpn. Vs. Krishna(JT 1005(4) SC 343).\r\n5. The appellants raised an industrial dispute pursuant to which the appropriate Government made\r\nthe reference order dated 8th April, 2003 for adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal as under:-\r\n\u201CWhether the de-regularization of regularized employees in the Annexure appended\r\nand their subsequent termination by the management of Sree Sankaracharya\r\nUniversity of Sanskrit is legal and justifiable? If not what relief they are entitled to?\u201D\r\n6. It may be noticed that the nature of appointment as a daily wager was not the subject matter of\r\nreference and undisputedly, so far as the order of de-regularisation dated 24th March, 1997 is\r\nconcerned, that was not open to be examined by the Tribunal pursuant to a reference made as it has\r\nattained finality by the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court after recording a finding\r\nthat the 1st respondent-University was justified in passing the order of de-regularisation of such\r\nemployees who were appointed without going through the process of selection prescribed under the\r\nUniversity Ordinance and were appointed on daily wage basis and such appointments could not\r\nhave been regularised by the 1 st respondent-University.\r\n7. The limited question in terms of the reference open to be examined by the Tribunal was as to\r\nwhether the termination which has been given effect to by the 1st respondent was legal and justified\r\nand if not, what relief the employee was entitled to.\r\n8. The Industrial Tribunal, after taking into consideration the material on record, returned a finding\r\nthat the termination of the appellants from service is in violation of Section 25F of the Act 1947 and\r\nas a natural consequence held the workman employee to be deemed in service till their services are\r\nvalidly terminated with 50% back wages. The relevant para 9 of the Award is as under:-\r\n9. If we go through the pleadings in the written statement, it can be seen that the service of the\r\nworkmen which had started in various dates in the year 1993, 94,95 and 96 had been regularized by\r\nthe university later through a proceedings dated 12.4.1996. From the date of commencement of their\r\nservice to the date of de- regularization of their services, all of them were having continuous service.\r\nAbout one year after from 12.4.96, their services were terminated on the basis of decision of the\r\nsyndicate of the university dated 23.3.97. Such a decision was as per the judgment of the Division\r\nBench of the High Court in the earlier writ appeal judgment. Therefore, from these admitted facts, it\r\ncan be seen that all these workmen were having continuous service and they had more than 240\r\ndays of service to their credit service. The management does not have any case that the terminations\r\neffected on these workmen concerned in this dispute were in compliance with Section 25-F of the\r\nI.D. Act. On that sole ground it has to be declared that the terminations effected in the case of\r\nworkmen were in violation of Sec. 25-F of the I.D. Act. Therefore, they would deem to be in service\r\ntill their services are validly terminated strictly in accordance with Industrial Disputes Act. In view\r\nof various decisions of the Supreme Court and the settled position laid thereon, the only relief which\r\ncan be granted in this case is by way of declaration that the termination of all workmen who had to\r\ntheir credit 240 days of continuous as explained in Sec. 25 were illegal. As a natural consequence, all\r\nof such workmen would deem to be in service till their services are validly terminated. Because of\r\nthat they entitled for full back wages also in the ordinary course. However, such entitlement cannot\r\nbe treated as a matter of rule always. I think it will be appropriate, if all the workmen concerned are\r\ngiven 50% of the backwages.\r\n9. The Award of the Tribunal dated 14th November, 2005 came to be challenged at the instance of\r\nthe 1st respondent before the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Kerala. The learned Single\r\nJudge without disturbing the finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal in its Award held that each of\r\nthe workmen has completed more than 240 days of service in the preceding 12 months from the\r\nalleged date of termination and their services were terminated without observance of Section 25F of\r\nthe Act 1947 but further proceeded on the premise that if the order of appointment of the workmen\r\nwas not valid and has not been made in terms of the procedure prescribed under the Ordinance,\r\nsuch irregular appointments are not entitled to seek protection of the Act 1947 and further observed\r\nthat retrenchment referred to under Section 25F applies to properly employed persons who are in\r\nservice and set aside the Award by a judgment dated 25th June, 2009. The relevant part is as\r\nunder:-\r\n\u201CIn my view, before proceeding to consider eligibility for relief under Section 25F, the\r\nTribunal should have considered whether appointment of employees terminated was\r\nproperly made. The Syndicate of the University ordered termination only after\r\nfinding that the employees who got appointment was through irregular ways. Section\r\n25F does not apply to as case of termination of illegally appointed employees. On the\r\nother hand, retrenchment referred to in Section 25F applies to properly employed\r\npersons who were in service. So much so, the order passed by the Industrial Tribunal\r\ndeclaring the termination of the employees as illegal is only to be set aside and I do\r\nso. Consequently, the terminated employees are not entitled to compensation\r\nordered by the Tribunal under Section 25F. During pendency of the W.P., some of the\r\nterminated employees were granted wages under Section 17B of the Industrial\r\nDisputes Act, under orders of this Court. Besides this, they are not entitled to any\r\nother relief. The W.P. is therefore allowed setting aside Ext. P14 award of the\r\nIndustrial Tribunal.\u201D\r\n10. That order of the learned Single Judge came to be confirmed by the Division Bench of the High\r\nCourt on writ appeal being preferred at the instance of the present appellants under the impugned\r\njudgment dated 4th January, 2010.\r\n11. Mr. M.T. George, learned counsel for the appellants submits that the finding of fact recorded by\r\nthe Tribunal has been confirmed by the High Court under the impugned judgment and it can be\r\nsafely noticed by this Court that the appellants were appointed on daily wage basis in non-teaching\r\nstaff category. Indisputedly, their appointments were made without going through the process of\r\nselection as being contemplated under the University Ordinance but this is not the case of the\r\nrespondents that either of the appellants had either misrepresented\/misled or committed fraud or\r\neither of them is not eligible in seeking employment in non-teaching category and it is also not being\r\ndisputed that each of them had been in continuous service of more than 240 days in the preceding\r\n12 months from the alleged date of termination.\r\n12. Learned counsel submits that admittedly there was a violation of Section 25F of the Act 1947. In\r\nconsequence thereof, no error was committed by the Tribunal in passing an Award treating them to\r\nbe deemed in service with 50% back wages unless validly terminated, obviously after compliance of\r\nthe mandatory requirement as contemplated under clauses (a) and (b) of Section 25F of the Act\r\n1947.\r\n13. Learned counsel further submits that the finding which has been recorded by the learned Single\r\nJudge and confirmed by the Division Bench under the impugned judgment that if the appointments\r\nare not being made in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, such employees are not\r\nentitled to seek protection of the Act 1947, is legally unsustainable in law as the nature of\r\nappointments is not a pre-condition for compliance of Section 25F and scheme of the Act 1947\r\ncontemplates that if the employee who is a workman under Section 2(s) has been retrenched as\r\ncontemplated under Section 2(oo) and if was in continuous service for more than 240 days in the\r\npreceding 12 months from the alleged date of termination as contemplated under Section 25B of the\r\nAct, the employer is under an obligation to comply with the mandatory requirement of clauses (a)\r\nand (b) of Section 25F, its non-observance as held by this Court, to be void ab initio bad with the\r\nconsequential order of reinstatement with full back wages and open for the employer to pass a fresh\r\norder after due compliance in accordance with law.\r\n14. In support of his submissions, learned counsel placed reliance on the judgments of this Court in\r\nState Bank of India Vs. Shri N. Sundara Money1; L. Robert D\u2019Souza Vs. Executive Engineer,Southern Railway and Another2; Punjab Land Development and Reclamation Corporation Ltd.,\r\nChandigarh Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Chandigarh and Others3 and Nagar 1976(1) SCC\r\n822 1982(1) SCC 645 3 1990(3) SCC 682 Mahapalika(Now Municipal Corpn.) Vs. State of U.P. and\r\nOthers4.\r\n15. Per contra, Mr. R. Basant, learned senior counsel for the respondents, while supporting the\r\nfinding recorded by the Division Bench of the High Court under the impugned judgment, submits\r\nthat after the finding has been recorded by the Division Bench in the earlier round of litigation\r\nholding such appointments being conceived in fraud and deceit are not entitled to seek protection of\r\nSection 25F by those employees whose appointments have been declared as void ab initio bad.\r\n16. Learned counsel further submits that the term \u2018retrenchment\u2019 under Section 2(oo) although have\r\nbeen couched with the words \u201Cfor any reason whatsoever\u201D but cannot be interpretated to protect\r\nthose who secured entry by backdoor and whose appointments are vitiated by fraud and deceit as\r\nbeing observed by the Division Bench of the High Court in the earlier round of litigation.\r\n17. In support of his submission, learned counsel placed reliance on the judgments of this Court in\r\nR. Vishwanatha Pillai Vs. State 4 2006(5) SCC 127 of Kerala and Others5; Rajasthan Tourism\r\nDevelopment Corporation Ltd. And Another Vs. Intejam Ali Zafri6 followed with recent judgments\r\nin Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Vs. Raj Kumar Rajinder Singh(Dead) through legal representatives and\r\nOthers7 and Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority and Another Vs. Karamjit Singh8.\r\n18. In the alternative, learned counsel further submits that assuming that there was a violation of\r\nSection 25F of the Act 1947, still there cannot be an automatic reinstatement as being considered by\r\nthis Court and each of the workmen had worked for a period 1993- 1997 and they were\r\nde-regularised by an order dated 24th March 1997, they may be entitled for reasonable\r\ncompensation in lieu of reinstatement looking to the period of service rendered by each of them and\r\nfurther submits that granting 50% back wages is grossly unfair as each of the workmen, during\r\npendency of the litigation, under Section 17B has received his last pay drawn and a total sum of Rs.\r\n36.68 lakhs has been paid to the contesting appellants- 2004(2) SCC 105 6 2006(6) SCC 275\r\n2019(14) SCC 449 8 2019(16) SCC 782 workmen and in the given circumstances, the finding\r\nrecorded by the Division Bench does not call for any interference.\r\n19. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their assistance perused the material\r\navailable on record.\r\n20. It is an admitted case of the parties that Act 1947 is applicable on the 1st respondent-University\r\nand they are under an obligation to comply with the provisions of the Act 1947. It is also admitted\r\nthat the 1st respondent is the employer as defined under Section 2(g) and the dispute which was\r\nraised is an industrial dispute as defined under Section 2(k) and the present appellants are the\r\nworkmen as defined under Section 2(s) and the termination which was given effect to by the 1st\r\nrespondent was a retrenchment as defined under Section 2(oo) and it is not the case of the 1st\r\nrespondent that their termination falls in any of the exceptions defined under Section 2(oo) of the\r\nAct 194721. Section 2(oo) relevant for the purpose is reproduced as under:-\r\n(oo) \"retrenchment means the termination by the employer of the service of a\r\nworkman for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by\r\nway of disciplinary action, but does not include\u2014\r\n(a) voluntary retirement of the workman; or\r\n(b) retirement of the workman on reaching the age of superannuation if the contract\r\nof employment between the employer and the workman concerned contains a\r\nstipulation in that behalf; or [(bb) termination of the service of the workman as a\r\nresult of the non-renewal of the contract of employment between the employer and\r\nthe workman concerned on its expiry or of such contract being terminated under a\r\nstipulation in that behalf contained therein; or]\r\n(c) termination of the service of a workman on the ground of continued ill-health;]\r\n22. The term \u2018retrenchment\u2019 leaves no manner of doubt that the termination of the workman for any\r\nreason whatsoever, otherwise than as punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action are being\r\ntermed as retrenchment with certain exceptions and it is not dependent upon the nature of\r\nemployment and the procedure pursuant to which the workman has entered into service. In\r\ncontinuation thereof, the condition precedent for retrenchment has been defined under Section 25F\r\nof the Act 1947 which postulates that workman employed in any industry who has been in\r\ncontinuous service for not less than one year can be retrenched by the employer after clauses (a) and\r\n(b) of Section 25F have been complied with and both the clauses (a) and (b) of Section 25F have\r\nbeen held by this Court to be mandatory and its non-observance is held to be void ab initio bad and\r\nwhat is being the continuous service has been defined under Section 25B of the Act 1947. It may be\r\nrelevant to quote Section 25B and clause (a) and (b) of Section 25F of the Act 1947 which are\r\nreproduced as under:-\r\n25B. Definition of continuous service.- For the purposes of this Chapter (1) a\r\nworkman shall be said to be in continuous service for a period if he is, for that period,\r\nin uninterrupted service, including service which may be interrupted on account of\r\nsickness or authorised leave or an accident or a strike which is not illegal, or a\r\nlock-out or a cessation of work which is not due to any fault on the part of the\r\nworkman;\r\n(2) where a workman is not in continuous service within the meaning of clause (1) for\r\na period of one year or six months, he shall be deemed to be in continuous service\r\nunder an employer\u2014\r\n(a) for a period of one year, if the workman, during a period of twelve calendar\r\nmonths preceding the date with reference to which calculation is to be made, has\r\nactually worked under the employer for not less than--(i) one hundred and ninety days in the case of a workman employed below ground in\r\na mine; and (ii) two hundred and forty days, in any other case;\r\n(b) for a period of six months, if the workman, during a period of six calendar months\r\npreceding the date with reference to which calculation is to be made, has actually\r\nworked under the employer for not less than--\r\n(i) ninety-five days, in the case of a workman employed below ground in a mine; and\r\n(ii) one hundred and twenty days, in any other case. Explanation.--For the purposes\r\nof clause (2), the number of days on which a workman has actually worked under an\r\nemployer shall include the days on which-- (i) he has been laid-off under an\r\nagreement or as permitted by standing orders made under the Industrial\r\nEmployment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 (20 of 1946), or under this Act or under\r\nany other law applicable to the industrial establishment; (ii) he has been on leave\r\nwith full wages, earned in the previous years; (iii) he has been absent due to\r\ntemporary disablement caused by accident arising out of and in the course of his\r\nemployment; and\r\n(iv) in the case of a female, she has been on maternity leave; so, however, that the\r\ntotal period of such maternity leave does not exceed twelve weeks.] 25F. Conditions\r\nprecedent to retrenchment of workmen.- No workman employed in any industry who\r\nhas been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall be\r\nretrenched by that employer until\u2014\r\n(a) the workman has been given one month's notice in writing indicating the reasons\r\nfor retrenchment and the period of notice has expired, or the workman has been paid\r\nin lieu of such notice, wages for the period of the notice:\r\n(b) the workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which\r\nshall be equivalent to fifteen days' average pay [for every completed year of\r\ncontinuous service] or any part thereof in excess of six months; and\r\n(c) notice in the prescribed manner is served on the appropriate Government [or such\r\nauthority as may be specified by the appropriate Government by notification in the\r\nOfficial Gazette].\r\n23. The scheme of the Act 1947 contemplates that the workman employed even as a daily wager or in\r\nany capacity, if has worked for more than 240 days in the preceding 12 months from the alleged date\r\nof termination and if the employer wants to terminate the services of such a workman, his services\r\ncould be terminated after due compliance of the twin clauses (a) and (b) of Section 25F of the Act\r\n1947 and to its non-observance held the termination to be void ab initio bad and so far as the\r\nconsequential effect of non-observance of the provisions of Section 25F of the Act 1947, may lead to\r\ngrant of relief of reinstatement with full back wages and continuity of service in favour of retrenched\r\nworkman, the same would not mean that the relief would be granted automatically but the workmanis entitled for appropriate relief for non-observance of the mandatory requirement of Section 25F of\r\nthe Act, 1947 in the facts and circumstances of each case.\r\n24. The salient fact which has to be considered is whether the employee who has been retrenched is\r\na workman under Section 2(s) and is employed in an industry defined under Section 2(j) and who\r\nhas been in continuous service for more than one year can be retrenched provided the employer\r\ncomplies with the twin conditions provided under clauses (a) and (b) of Section 25F of the Act 1947\r\nbefore the retrenchment is given effect to. The nature of employment and the manner in which the\r\nworkman has been employed is not significant for consideration while invoking the mandatory\r\ncompliance of Section 25F of the Act 1947.\r\n25. This can be noticed from the term \u2018retrenchment\u2019 as defined under Section 2(oo) which in\r\nunequivocal terms clearly postulates that termination of the service of a workman for any reason\r\nwhatsoever provided it does not fall in any of the exception clause of Section 2(oo), every\r\ntermination is a retrenchment and the employer is under an obligation to comply with the twin\r\nconditions of Section 25F of the Act 1947 before the retrenchment is given effect to obviously in\r\nreference to such termination where the workman has served for more than 240 days in the\r\npreceding 12 months from the alleged date of termination given effect to as defined under Section\r\n25B of the Act.\r\n26. This Court in State Bank of India(supra) while examining the retrenchment of various nature of\r\nemployments questioning the interpretation of Section 2(oo) of the Act held as under:-\r\n8. Without further ado, we reach the conclusion that if the workman swims into the\r\nharbour of Section 25-F, he cannot be retrenched without payment, at the time of\r\nretrenchment, compensation computed as prescribed therein read with Section\r\n25-B(2). But, argues the appellant, all these obligations flow only out of\r\nretrenchment, not termination outside that species -of snapping employment. What,\r\nthen, is retrenchment? The key to this vexed question is to be found in Section 2(oo)\r\nwhich reads thus:\r\n2. (oo) \u201Cretrenchment\u201D means the termination by the employer of the service of a\r\nworkman for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by\r\nway of disciplinary action, but does not include\u2014\r\n(a) voluntary retirement of the workman; or\r\n(b) retirement of the workman on reaching the age of superannuation if the contract\r\nof employment between the employer and the workman concerned contains a\r\nstipulation in that behalf;\r\nor\r\n(c) termination of the service of a workman on the ground of continued ill-health;\u201D For any reason\r\nwhatsoever \u2014 very wide and almost admitting of no exception. Still, the employer urges that when\r\nthe order of appointment carries an automatic cessation of service, the period of employment works\r\nitself out by efflux of time, not by act of employer. Such cases are outside the concept of\r\n\u201Cretrenchment\u201D and cannot entail the burdensome conditions of Section 25-F. Of course, that a one\r\nyear and ten months \u201Cnine-days\u201D employment, hedged is with an express condition of temporariness\r\nand automatic cessation, may look like being in a different street (if we may use a colloquialism)\r\nfrom telling a man off by retrenching him. To retrench is to cut down. You cannot retrench without\r\ntrenching or cutting. But dictionaries are not dictators of statutory construction where the benignant\r\nmood of a law and, more emphatically, the definition clause furnish a different denotation. Section\r\n2(oo) is the master of the situation and the Court cannot truncate its amplitude.\r\n9. A breakdown of Section 2(oo) unmistakably expands the semantics of retrenchment. Termination\r\n... for any reason whatsoever are the key words. Whatever the reason, every termination spells\r\nretrenchment. So the sole question is, has the employee's service been terminated? Verbal apparel\r\napart, the substance is decisive. A termination takes place where a term expires either by the active\r\nstep of the master or the running out of the stipulated term. To protect the weak against the strong\r\nthis policy of comprehensive definition has been effectuated. Termination embraces not merely the\r\nact of termination by the employer, but the fact of termination howsoever produced. Maybe, the\r\npresent may be a hard case, but we can visualise abuses by employers, by suitable verbal devices,\r\ncircumventing the armour of Section 25-F and Section 2(oo). Without speculating on possibilities,\r\nwe may agree that \u201Cretrenchment\u201D is no longer terra incognita but area covered by an expansive\r\ndefinition. It means \u201Cto end, conclude, cease\u201D. In the present case the employment ceased,\r\nconcluded, ended on the expiration of one year ten months nine days \u2014 automatically may be, but\r\ncessation all the same. That to write into the order of appointment the date of termination confers\r\nno moksha from Section 25-F(b) is inferable from the proviso to Section 25-F(1) [sic 25-F (a)]. True,\r\nthe section speaks of retrenchment by the employer and it is urged that some act of volition by the\r\nemployer to bring about the termination is essential to attract Section 25-F and automatic\r\nextinguishment of service by effluxion of time cannot be sufficient. An English case R. v. Secretary of\r\nState was relied on, where Lord Denning, M.R. observed:\r\n\u201CI think that the word \u2018terminate\u2019 or \u2018termination\u2019 is by itself ambiguous. It can refer\r\nto either of two things \u2014 either to termination by notice or to termination by\r\neffluxion of time. It is often used in that dual sense in landlord and tenant and in\r\nmaster and servant cases. But there are several indications in this para to show that it\r\nrefers here only to termination by notice.\u201D Buckley, L.J. concurred and said:\r\n\u201CIn my judgment the words are not capable of bearing that meaning. As Counsel for\r\nthe Secretary of State has pointed out, the verb \u2018terminate\u2019 can be used either\r\ntransitively or intransitively. A contract may be said to terminate when it comes to an\r\nend by effluxion of time, or it may be said to be terminated when it is determined at\r\nnotice or otherwise by some act of one of the parties. Here in my judgment the word\r\n\u2018terminated\u2019 is used in this passage in para 190 in the transitive sense, and it\r\npostulates some act by somebody which is to bring the appointment to an end, and is\r\nnot applicable to a case in which the appointment comes to an end merely by\r\neffluxion of time.\u201D Words of multiple import have to be winnowed judicially to suit\r\nthe social philosophy of the statute. So screened, we hold that the transitive and\r\nintransitive senses are covered in the current context. Moreover, an employer\r\nterminates employment not merely by passing an order as the service runs. He can\r\ndo so by writing a composite order, one giving employment and the other ending or\r\nlimiting it. A separate, subsequent determination is not the sole magnetic pull of the\r\nprovision. A pre-emptive provision to terminate is struck by the same vice as the\r\npost-appointment termination. Dexterity of diction cannot defeat the articulated\r\nconscience of the provision.\r\n27. It was later followed in L. Robert D\u2019Souza(supra) and held as under:-\r\n25. Assuming we are not right in holding that the appellant had acquired the status of\r\na temporary railway servant and that he continued to belong to the category of casual\r\nlabour, would the termination of service in the circumstances mentioned by the\r\nRailway Administration constitute retrenchment under the Act?\r\n26. Section 25-F of the Act provides that no workman employed in any industry who\r\nhas been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall be\r\nretrenched by that employer until the conditions set out in the Act are satisfied. The\r\nexpression \u201Cworkman\u201D is defined as under:\r\n\u201C2. In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,\u2014\r\n(s) \u201Cworkman\u201D means any person (including an apprentice) employed in any industry\r\nto do any skilled or unskilled manual, supervisory, technical or clerical work for hire\r\nor reward, whether the terms of employment be expressed or implied, and for the\r\npurposes of any proceeding under this Act in relation to an industrial dispute,\r\nincludes any such person who has been dismissed, discharged or retrenched in\r\nconnection with, or as a consequence of, that dispute, or whose dismissal, discharge,\r\nor retrenchment has led to that dispute, but does not include any such person\u2014\r\n(i) who is subject to the Army Act, 1950, or the Air Force Act, 1950, or the Navy\r\n(Discipline) Act, 1934; or\r\n(ii) who is employed in the police service or as an officer or other employee of a\r\nprison; or\r\n(iii) who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity; or\r\n(iv) who, being employed in a supervisory capacity, draws wages exceeding five\r\nhundred rupees per mensem or exercises, either by the nature of the duties attached\r\nto the office or by reason of the powers vested in him, functions mainly of amanagerial nature.\u201D\r\n27. There is no dispute that the appellant would be a workman within the meaning of\r\nthe expression in Section 2 (s) of the Act.\r\nFurther, it is incontrovertible that he has rendered continuous service for a period over 20 years.\r\nTherefore, the first condition of Section 25-F that appellant is a workman who has rendered service\r\nfor not less than one year under the Railway Administration, an employer carrying on an industry,\r\nand that his service is terminated which for the reasons hereinbefore given would constitute\r\nretrenchment. It is immaterial that he is a daily-rated worker. He is either doing manual or technical\r\nwork and his salary was less than Rs 500 and the termination of his service does not fall in any of\r\nthe excepted categories. Therefore, assuming that he was a daily-rated worker, once he has rendered\r\ncontinuous uninterrupted service for a period of one year or more, within the meaning of Section\r\n25-F of the Act and his service is terminated for any reason whatsoever and the case does not fall in\r\nany of the excepted categories, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 2505 would be attracted, it would\r\nhave to be read subject to the provisions of the Act. Accordingly the termination of service in this\r\ncase would constitute retrenchment and for not complying with pro-conditions to valid\r\nretrenchment, the order of termination would be illegal and invalid.\r\n28. Later, in Punjab Land Development and Reclamation Corporation Ltd., Chandigarh(supra), the\r\nConstitution Bench of this Court examined the scope of the term \u2018Retrenchment\u201D under Section\r\n2(oo) of the Act in affirmative in paragraphs 14 and 82. The relevant paras are as under:-\r\n14. The precise question to be decided, therefore, is whether on a proper construction\r\nof the definition of \u201Cretrenchment\u201D in Section 2(oo) of the Act, it means termination\r\nby the employer of the service of a workman as surplus labour for any reason\r\nwhatsoever, or it means termination by the employer of the service of a workman for\r\nany reason whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of\r\ndisciplinary action, and those expressly excluded by the definition. In other words,\r\nthe question to be decided is whether the word \u201Cretrenchment\u201D in the definition has\r\nto be understood in its narrow, natural and contextual meaning or in its wider literal\r\nmeaning.\r\n82. Applying the above reasonings, principles and precedents, to the definition in\r\nSection 2(oo) of the Act, we hold that \u201Cretrenchment\u201D means the termination by the\r\nemployer of the service of a workman for any reason whatsoever except those\r\nexpressly excluded in the section.\r\n29. It leaves no manner of doubt that the nature of every termination of a kind, by the service of a\r\nworkman, for any reason whatsoever, which the Legislature in its wisdom made a clarification in its\r\nintention to be known to the employer that such of the workman whose services, if to be terminated,\r\nwill amount to retrenchment under Section 2(oo) of the Act except those expressly excluded in the\r\nsection.\r\n30. It is not open for us to examine the nature of employment offered to the workman and the\r\nmanner he had served the employer is beyond the terms of reference made by the appropriate\r\nGovernment dated 8th April, 2003 and the fact is that if the service of the workman has been\r\nterminated, it will be termed to be a retrenchment under Section 2(oo) of the Act provided it does\r\nnot fall under any of those expressly excluded under the section. In every retrenchment, the\r\nemployer is not under an obligation to comply with the twin conditions referred to under clauses (a)\r\nand (b) of Section 25F of the Act but in a case where the workman has been in continuous service for\r\nmore than 240 days in the preceding 12 months before the alleged date of termination as\r\ncontemplated under Section 25B, the employer is under an obligation to comply with the twin\r\nconditions referred to under clauses (a) and (b) of Section 25F of the Act 1947.\r\n31. The consistent view of this Court is that such non-observance has been termed to be void ab\r\ninitio bad and consequence in the ordinary course has to follow by reinstatement with consequential\r\nbenefits but it is not held to be automatic and what alternative relief the workman is entitled for on\r\naccount of non-observance of mandatory requirement of Section 25F of the Act 1947 is open to be\r\nconsidered by the Tribunal\/Courts in the facts and circumstances of each case.\r\n32. What appropriate relief the workman may be entitled for regarding non-compliance of Section\r\n25F of the Act 1947 has been considered by this Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited Vs.\r\nBhurumal9. The relevant paras are as under:-\r\n33. It is clear from the reading of the aforesaid judgments that the ordinary principle of grant of\r\nreinstatement with full back wages, when the termination is found to be illegal is not applied\r\nmechanically in all cases. While that may be a position where services of a regular\/permanent\r\nworkman are terminated illegally and\/or mala fide and\/or by way of victimisation, unfair labour\r\npractice, etc. However, when it comes to the case of termination of a daily-wage worker and where\r\nthe termination is found illegal because of a procedural defect, namely, in violation of Section 25-F\r\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, this Court is consistent in taking the view that in such cases\r\nreinstatement with back wages is not automatic and instead the workman should be given monetary\r\ncompensation which will meet the ends of justice. Rationale for shifting in this direction is obvious.\r\n34. The reasons for denying the relief of reinstatement in such cases are obvious. It is trite law that\r\nwhen the termination is found to be illegal because of non-payment of retrenchment compensation\r\nand notice pay as mandatorily required under Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, even after\r\nreinstatement, it is always open to the management to terminate the services of that employee by\r\npaying him the retrenchment compensation. Since such a workman was working on daily-wage\r\nbasis and even after he is reinstated, he has no right to seek regularisation [see State of Karnataka v.\r\nUmadevi (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1]. Thus when he cannot claim regularisation and he has no right to\r\ncontinue even as a daily- wage worker, no useful purpose is going to be served in reinstating such a\r\nworkman and he can be given monetary compensation by the Court itself inasmuch as if he is\r\nterminated again after reinstatement, he would receive monetary compensation only in the form of\r\nretrenchment compensation and notice pay. In such a situation, giving the relief of reinstatement,\r\nthat too after a long gap, would not serve any purpose.35. We would, however, like to add a caveat here. There may be cases where termination of a\r\ndaily-wage worker is found to be illegal on the ground that it was resorted to as unfair labour\r\npractice or in violation of the principle of last come first go viz. while retrenching 2014(7) SCC 177\r\nsuch a worker daily wage juniors to him were retained. There may also be a situation that persons\r\njunior to him were regularised under some policy but the workman concerned terminated. In such\r\ncircumstances, the terminated worker should not be denied reinstatement unless there are some\r\nother weighty reasons for adopting the course of grant of compensation instead of reinstatement. In\r\nsuch cases, reinstatement should be the rule and only in exceptional cases for the reasons stated to\r\nbe in writing, such a relief can be denied.\r\n33. It has been further followed in District Development Officer and Another Vs. Satish Kantilal\r\nAmralia10.\r\n34. In the instant case, the appellants had served as a daily wager in non-teaching staff category\r\nfrom the year 1993-1997 and their services were terminated in sequel to the order dated 24th March,\r\n1997 pursuant to which their services were de-regularized and that has been upheld by the Division\r\nBench of the High Court in writ appeal preferred at the instance of the appellants in the earlier\r\nround of litigation.\r\n35. In the afore-stated facts, the High Court of Kerala in the earlier round of litigation made certain\r\nadverse observations with regard to the nature of appointment as a daily wager but still the alleged\r\ntermination was left open to examine the effect of non-observance of 2018(12) SCC 298 the Act,\r\n1947 in the appropriate proceedings. Thus, what has been observed by the Division Bench in its\r\nJudgment in the earlier round of litigation may not have any relevance so far as the question which\r\nhas been examined by the Tribunal in answering the reference in affirmative terms regarding\r\nnon-observance of Section 25F of the Act 1947 and its consequential effect.\r\n36. At the same time, the finding which has been recorded by the learned Single Judge and\r\nconfirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment that if the\r\nappointment has not been properly made after going through the process of selection as provided\r\nunder the statutory rules\/Ordinance, as the case may be, if such irregular appointments are being\r\nterminated, Section 25F will not apply to a case of termination of such appointed employees. The\r\nview expressed by the High Court in the impugned judgment, in our considered view, is\r\nunsustainable in law and is not in conformity with the scheme of the Act 1947 and deserves to be set\r\naside.\r\n37. The submission made by learned counsel for the respondents that after the finding has been\r\nrecorded by the Division Bench of the High Court in the earlier round of litigation holding the seal of\r\napproval on the appointments of the appellants to an act which is conceived in fraud and delivered\r\nin deceit, are not entitled to claim benefit under Section 25F of the Act 1947. In our considered view,\r\nthe submission is without substance for the reason that appointments are made in the instant case\r\non daily wage basis under the orders of the Vice Chancellor who is the competent\/appointing\r\nauthority and merely because their appointments are not in accordance with the procedure\r\nprescribed under the Ordinance would not disentitle them from claiming protection underprovisions of the Act 1947.\r\n38. The judgment in R. Vishwanatha Pillai(supra) on which learned counsel for the respondents has\r\nplaced reliance was a case where the incumbent sought an appointment as Scheduled Caste\r\ncandidate. On complaint, it revealed that he was not a member of the Scheduled Caste category and\r\nin that reference, a finding was recorded that the appointment has been obtained by fraud. What\r\nwill be the consequence, it does not have any application in the facts of the instant cases.\r\n39. So far as the judgment in Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. and another(supra)\r\nis concerned, it was a case where the workmen had not worked for 240 days in the calendar year\r\nwhich is the condition precedent for attracting the provisions of Section 25F of the Act 1947. In\r\nthose circumstances, a passing reference has been made regarding non-observance of Section 25F of\r\nthe Act 1947, which, in our view, may not be of any assistance to the respondents.\r\n40. The next judgment relied upon in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam(supra) is the case of abolition of jagirs\r\nby virtue of the Himachal Pradesh Abolition of Big Landed Estates and Land Reforms Act, 1953.\r\nWhile examining the abolition of Jagirs under the Act, reference has been made of fraud and deceit\r\nwhich has no application in the facts of the instant case.\r\n41. So far as the judgment in Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority and\r\nAnother(supra) is concerned, it was a case where three years\u2019 service was required for seeking\r\nregularization of service in terms of circular issued by the authority under its policy dated 23rd\r\nJanuary, 2001 and the incumbent had not completed three years of service for seeking\r\nregularization but due to some inadvertence, his name was included in the list of candidates who\r\nwere regularized and after a show cause notice, his services were terminated. In that context,\r\nreference has been made which may not have any remote application on the facts of the case.\r\n42. In the facts and circumstances of the instant cases and looking into the nature of service\r\nrendered by the appellants as daily wager for a short period, while upholding the termination of the\r\nappellants being in violation of Section 25F of the Act 1947, we consider it just and reasonable to\r\naward a lumpsum monetary compensation of Rs.2,50,000\/- (Rupees two lakh fifty thousand) to\r\neach of the appellants-workmen in full and final satisfaction of the dispute in lieu of right to claim\r\nreinstatement with 50% back wages as awarded by the Tribunal.\r\n43. The respondents shall pay the compensation as awarded by this Court to each of the\r\nappellants-workmen within a period of three months.\r\n44. In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeals succeed and are partly allowed. The impugned\r\njudgment of the High Court dated 4th January, 2010 is hereby set aside and the Award of the\r\nIndustrial Tribunal dated 14th November, 2005 is modified to the extent indicated above.\r\n45. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

The High Court has categorically found that scuffle had taken place on the spur of the\r\nmoment and that sudden fight had taken place in the heat of passion, upon a sudden quarrel and it\r\nwas not a pre\u2212 Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)Nos.11140-11141 of 2019 meditated act. It has also come on record\r\nthat appellant, the co\u2212 accused and the deceased had consumed liquor and even in the chemical\r\nexaminer report it was found that deceased had also consumed liquor. The High Court has modified\r\nthe conviction from Section 302 IPC to 304 Part\u2212I IPC and imposed the sentence, of 12 years\u2019\r\nrigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000\/\u2212, on the appellant herein and co\u2212accused for\r\nthe offence under Section 304 Part\u2212I with a default clause that in the event of non\u2212payment of fine,\r\nthey shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for a further period of six months.\r\n6. We have heard Sri Bharat Sood, learned counsel for the appellant and Ms. Jaspreet Gogia, learned\r\ncounsel for the State of Punjab.\r\n7. The only submission made by learned counsel for the appellant Sri Bharat Sood is that there was\r\nno intention at all on the part of the appellant\u2212accused to kill the deceased. It is submitted that the\r\nappellant, co\u2212accused and deceased had consumed liquor and on the ground that the deceased had\r\nstolen pigeon of appellant Kala Singh, scuffle took place between deceased Shamber Singh and\r\nappellant Kala Singh. It is submitted that at that point of time, the co\u2212accused Kehar Singh gave one\r\nrod blow on the head of the Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)Nos.11140-11141 of 2019 deceased Shamber Singh\r\nwhich resulted into his death. It is submitted that scuffle had taken place on the spur of the moment\r\nand that sudden fight had taken place in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. It was not a\r\npre\u2212meditated act and there was no intention at all to kill the deceased. It is submitted that having\r\nregard to the reasoning assigned by the High Court itself High Court ought to have modified the\r\nconviction to Section 304 Part\u2212II but not 304 Part\u2212I, as ordered. To buttress his argument, learned\r\ncounsel has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in the case of Uday Singh v. State of U.P.1\r\nwherein this Court has modified the conviction to one under Section 304 Part\u2212II IPC. Learned\r\ncounsel by further submitting that appellant has already served more than three years of sentence,\r\nmade a request to reduce the sentence by converting the conviction to one under Section 304 Part\u2212\r\nII IPC.\r\n8. On the other hand, Ms. Jaspreet Gogia, learned counsel for the State of Punjab has contended\r\nthat there are absolutely no grounds to interfere with the judgment of conviction and order of\r\nsentence passed by the High Court. It is submitted that sufficient leniency is already shown to the\r\nappellant\u2212accused and there are no grounds to interfere with the impugned judgment. It is further 1\r\n(2002) 7 SCC 79 Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)Nos.11140-11141 of 2019 contended that the case law which is\r\nrelied on by the appellant is distinguishable on facts and cannot be applied to the facts of the case on\r\nhand.\r\n9. Having heard learned counsels on both sides, we have perused the impugned judgment and other\r\nmaterial placed on record. It is clear from the impugned judgment and other material placed on\r\nrecord that the incident happened one day prior to the date of panchayat elections. On the fateful\r\nday, the appellant, co\u2212accused and deceased went to the house of one Hardev Singh Arora and they\r\ntook one bottle of liquor with them. Thereafter they went to bridge of Doda Minor through Harike\r\npassage. There they consumed liquor where there was a quarrel between the appellant and deceased\r\nShamber Singh alleging that deceased Shamber Singh had stolen the pigeon of appellant herein. The\r\nco\u2212accused Kehar Singh who had a rod with him, gave a rod blow on the head of Shamber Singh.\r\nImmediately thereafter he fell down and as there was no response even after half an hour, they have\r\nshifted the body to the minor canal. It is clear from the evidence and other material placed on record\r\nthat there was no intention to kill the deceased Shamber Singh. It is clear from the evidence on\r\nrecord that the scuffle had taken place on the spur of the moment and a sudden fight had taken\r\nplace in the heat of Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)Nos.11140-11141 of 2019 passion upon a sudden quarrel. It\r\nwas not a pre\u2212meditated one and as there was no intention on the part of the appellant and co\u2212\r\naccused either to cause death or cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the High Court\r\nought not to have convicted the appellant for the offence under Section 304 Part\u2212I IPC. In absence\r\nof any intention on the part of the appellant, we are of the view that it is a clear case where the\r\nconviction of the appellant is to be modified to one under Section 304 Part\u2212II IPC by maintaining\r\nthe conviction for the offence under Section 201 IPC. The case law which is relied on by the learned\r\ncounsel for the appellant also supports the case of the appellant for converting his conviction from\r\nthe one under Section 304 Part\u2212I IPC to the one under Section 304 Part\u2212II IPC.\r\n10. The judgment relied on by the counsel for the appellant, in the case of Uday Singh v. State of\r\nU.P.1 supports the case of the appellant. The relevant paragraphs 6 and 7 read as under :\r\n\u201C6. From the findings recorded by the trial court as well as the High Court, it is clear\r\nthat the fight between the two parties started all of a sudden as a result of obstruction\r\ncaused in digging of the foundation and there is no evidence to show that the accused\r\nattacked the deceased with deadly or dangerous arms (or weapons). It was only in a\r\nfight, hand to fist, that both Gainda Singh and the appellant had held the neck of the\r\ndeceased, Shishupal Singh with such force as to ultimately result in\r\nCrl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)Nos.11140-11141 of 2019 strangulation and his death. It is very\r\ndifficult to conceive as to how much pressure was applied either by Gainda Singh or\r\nthe appellant on the deceased's neck so as to cause death. It would be reasonable to\r\nhold that the injuries were caused by the appellant on the deceased in a sudden fight\r\nwhere no arms (or weapons) were used and that fight took place in the heat of\r\npassion and no common intention to kill the deceased could be inferred. We cannot\r\ndefinitely conclude who actually inflicted the fatal injury as the evidence on recorddiscloses that Gainda Singh and the appellant both strangled the deceased, which\r\naction is part of the sudden unarmed fight nor can we conclude that the appellant had\r\nan intention to cause death or cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death,\r\nthough we attribute to him knowledge that such act is likely to cause death. Thus the\r\nappellant and Gainda Singh are guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to\r\nmurder.\r\n7. In the circumstances, we set aside the conviction recorded by the trial court as\r\naffirmed by the High Court under Section 302 read with Section 34 and instead\r\nconvict him under Section 304 Part II and reduce the sentence to imprisonment for a\r\nperiod of seven years. The bail granted earlier shall stand cancelled and the appellant\r\nshall surrender before the trial court and be committed to prison to serve out the\r\nremaining part of the sentence.\u201D So also, the judgment in the case of Shahajan Ali &\r\nOrs. etc. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. etc.2 supports the case of the appellant.\r\nParagraph 8 of the judgment, which is relevant, reads as under :\r\n\u201C8. We have no doubt about the complicity of all the accused in the homicide of\r\nSarfraj. A\u22121 attacked the 2 (2017) 11 SC 807 Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)Nos.11140-11141 of\r\n2019 deceased with the knife and caused injury on his neck which resulted in his\r\ndeath. The other accused assisted him in committing the crime by holding the hands\r\nof the deceased. However, the only question that falls for our consideration is\r\nwhether the accused are liable to be punished for an offence under Section 302 IPC.\r\nAfter considering the submissions made by the counsel for the appellants and\r\nscrutinising the material on record, we are of the opinion that the accused are not\r\nliable to be convicted under Section 302 IPC. We are convinced that there was\r\nneither prior concert nor common intention to commit a murder. During the course\r\nof their business activity the accused reached the dhaba where the deceased was\r\npresent. An altercation took place during the discussion they were having behind the\r\ndhaba. That led to a sudden fight during which A\u22121 attacked the deceased with a\r\nknife. Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC is applicable to the facts of this case. As we are\r\nconvinced that the accused are responsible for the death of Sarfraj, we are of the\r\nopinion that they are liable for conviction under Section 304 Part II IPC. We are\r\ninformed that A\u22121 has undergone a sentence of seven years and that A\u22122 to A\u22124 have\r\nundergone four years of imprisonment. We modify the judgment of the High Court\r\nconverting the conviction of the accused from Section 302 to Section 304 Part II IPC\r\nsentencing them to the period already undergone. They shall be released forthwith.\u201D\r\n11. In view of the aforesaid reasons, these appeals are allowed in part and conviction of the appellant\r\nis modified from the one under Section 304 Part\u2212I\/34 IPC to the one under Section 304 Part\u2212II\/34\r\nIPC. The appellant is hereby sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven\r\nyears and the fine of Rs.10,000\/\u2212 imposed by the High Court is maintained. Further, conviction of\r\nthe Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)Nos.11140-11141 of 2019 appellant for the offence under Section 201 IPC and\r\nsentence of three years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment and the fine of Rs.500\/\u2212 are also maintained.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

          "judgement":"J.K. Maheshwari, J.\r\nLeave granted.\r\n2. This appeal has been filed arising out of the judgment dated 25.11.2017, passed by High Court of\r\nJudicature of Rajasthan Bench at Jaipur, in Criminal Appeal No. 491 of 2012, whereby, the order\r\ndated 21.04.2012 passed by Special Judge (N.D.P.S.), Jhalawar, Rajasthan in Sessions Case No. 49\r\nof 2011 convicting the appellant under Sections 8 & 21 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstance Act (hereinafter referred to as \"NDPS Act\") and sentenced to undergo rigorous\r\nimprisonment for 10 years along with fine of Rs. 1,00,000\/\u2212 (One Lakh) has been affirmed. While\r\nconfirming the conviction and sentence, the High Court reduced the default sentence from 2 years to\r\n1 year.\r\n3. The facts briefly put, as per prosecution allegations, on the date of incident i.e. 24.04.2011, S.I.\r\nPranveer Singh (P.W. 6) Station In\u2212charge of Bhawani Mandi Police Station alongwith constables\r\nPreetam Singh (P.W. 1), Sardar Singh (P.W. 2) and Rajendra Prasad (P.W. 8), was on routine\r\npatrolling at around 6:05 a.m. from Sulia Chowki to Sunel and reached Jhokadia. While returning\r\nfrom Jhokadia to Bhawani Mandi, they saw the accused Kallu Khan riding an unnumbered\r\nmotorcycle and coming from opposite direction. On seeing the police patrolling vehicle, Kallu Khan\r\nturned back and tried to ran away. Suspecting his conduct, the police party apprehended and\r\nquestioned him. In enquiry about his behaviour, accused Kallu Khan did not give satisfactory reply.\r\nOn having doubt, S.I. Pranveer Singh (P.W. 6) ordered constable Preetam Singh (P.W.\r\n1) to arrange independent witness for search of accused Kallu Khan and also of the motorcycle\r\nwhich he was riding. Constable Preetam Singh (P.W.1) submitted a report to him that independent\r\nwitness could not be found immediately for search. Thereon, looking to the conduct of accused, S.I.\r\nPranveer Singh (P.W. 6) obtained consent from Constable Sardar Singh (P.W. 2) & Constable\r\nRajendra Prasad (P.W. 8) and made them witness for the search of the vehicle.\r\n4. Thereafter, the accused Kallu Khan was given notice under Section 50 of NDPS Act informing that\r\nhe could be searched before a Gazette Officer or Magistrate, on which, he gave his consent for search\r\nby S.H.O.. After consent, the search of his body as well as of motorcycle was conducted. During the\r\npersonal search, no incriminating substance was recovered from him, whereas, in search of\r\nmotorcycle, a polythene bag beneath the seat of motorcycle was found, containing brown substance\r\nresembling smack which was burnt on a paper and, from its smell, it was confirmed to be smack.\r\nThe substance weighed 900gms, out of which, two samples were prepared, sealed and marked as \u2018A\u2019\r\n& \u2018B\u2019 respectively. The remaining substance was put in another bag marked as \u2018C\u2019 and sealed,\r\nwhereafter, accused Kallu Khan was taken to Police Station and an offence under Sections 8 & 21\r\nwas registered as Crime No. 130\/2011 against him and the investigation was conducted. On\r\ncompletion of investigation, charge\u2212sheet was filed against accused Kallu Khan before the Court of\r\nSpecial Judge, where charges under Sections 8 & 21 of NDPS Act were framed. The accused abjured\r\nhis guilt and demanded trial taking defence of false implication.\r\n5. The Trial Court after recording the evidence, found strength in the testimony of Constable\r\nPreetam Singh (PW1), Constable Sardar Singh (PW2), S.I. Pranveer Singh (PW6) and Constable\r\nRajendra Prasad (PW8) and held that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.\r\nThe Trial Court further noted that, the place of incident is on public road which leads from Bhawani\r\nMandi to Sunel. It is said despite efforts, due to non\u2212availability of independent witnesses, S.I.\r\nPranveer Singh (P.W.6) conducted proceedings of search after consent and seizure being\r\ntemporarily posted as In\u2212charge of Bhawani Mandi Police Station and completed the same. It is\r\nobserved that though the search appears to have been done superficially, but evidence of police\r\npersonnel cannot be discarded merely because they are departmental witnesses. There was no\r\nenmity of police personnel with accused and no interest of any witness was shown in the matter.\r\nThus, the Trial Court with those findings convicted accused Kallu Khan for the offences under\r\nSections 8 & 21 of NDPS Act and directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years with fine\r\nof Rs. 1,00,000\/\u2212 and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for two years.\r\n6. The appellant preferred appeal before High Court and primarily rest his challenge on the\r\ngrounds; firstly, S.I. Pranveer Singh (PW6) was not posted as Station In\u2212charge of the concerned\r\npolice station, as such he was not authorized to conduct search & seizure. Secondly, no independent\r\nwitnesses were associated in the search and seizure proceedings, however the said recovery is\r\nvitiated. Thirdly, there are glaring contradictions in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses.\r\n7. Upon hearing, the High Court was unimpressed of the pleas raised by the accused\/appellant and\r\neven on reappraisal of evidence, concurred with the findings of Trial Court. The High Court said, it\r\nwas a case of chance recovery while the accused in transit was suspected by the police patrolling\r\nparty on a public road, hence, recovery proceedings would be governed by Section 43 of NDPS Act.\r\nNonetheless, the High Court reduced the default sentence from two years without disturbing the\r\nfindings of conviction and main sentence.8. On perusal of the proceedings of this case, it reveals that on 29.10.2021, looking to the surrender\r\ncertificate, it was observed the appellant had already served the sentence of 10 years. As the\r\nappellant had already served the main sentence, however directed to be released on interim bail.\r\nThe report further indicate that the appellant had been released on bail on 24.04.2021 on depositing\r\nthe amount of fine of Rs. 1 lakh. Thus, the sentence, as awarded, by the Trial Court and confirmed by\r\nthe High Court, had already been served by the appellant, depositing the amount of fine.\r\n9. Mr. C.N. Srieekumar, learned senior counsel representing the appellant has strenuously urged\r\nthat in the present case, the search and seizure was conducted by an unauthorized officer with the\r\nhelp of the police witnesses without independent witnesses. He has placed reliance on the judgment\r\nof this Court in Union of India vs. Mohanlal and another (2016)3 SCC 379 and contends that in\r\nabsence of handling and disposal of seized narcotic drags\/psychotropic substances, the danger of\r\nre\u2212circulation of seized contraband back into the system cannot be ruled out. Learned senior\r\ncounsel would further argue that in the present case, the prosecution has not proved its case beyond\r\nreasonable doubt. The procedure, as contemplated under Section 50(1) of NDPS Act, has not been\r\nfollowed. The ownership of the vehicle is not of the accused, however the link of the vehicle in\r\ncommission of the offence qua accused is missing. The contraband article has not been produced in\r\nthe court during evidence. With the said contention, it is argued that the Trial Court and High Court\r\nhave committed error to prove the guilt of the appellant, and sentenced him for the charges under\r\nSections 8 & 21 of NDPS Act.\r\n10. On the other hand, learned counsel representing the State contends that it is not a case based on\r\nrecovery of contraband from personal search of the accused, in fact, recovery is from the motor cycle\r\ni.e. the vehicle used in commission of offence. Therefore, the mandatory compliance of Section 50 of\r\nNDPS Act do not attract in the case. Reliance is placed on a Constitutional Bench judgment of this\r\nCourt in Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja vs. State of Gujarat (2011) 1 SCC 609. Reliance has further\r\nbeen placed on the case of State of Punjab vs. Baljinder Singh (2019) 10 SCC 473. It is urged that the\r\nrecovery is a chance recovery from the motor cycle, used in the commission of offence, therefore, the\r\nprovisions of Section 43 of NDPS Act would attract. Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court\r\nin S.K. Raju vs. State of West Bengal (2018) 9 SCC 708. As per Section 43 of NDPS Act, Pranveer\r\nSingh\u2212PW6 is competent for the search and seizure and the High Court has rightly recorded the\r\nfindings on this issue. It is also contended that in case, the search and seizure is otherwise proved,\r\nproduction of contraband article in court is not required. It is urged that conviction based on the\r\npolice witnesses without having an independent witness is not always fatal. In support of the said\r\ncontention, reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Surinder Kumar vs. State of Punjab\r\n(2020) 2 SCC 563 to urge that merely because the prosecution did not examine any independent\r\nwitness would not necessarily lead to conclusion that accused was falsely implicated. In the said\r\njudgment, law laid down in the case of Jarnail Singh vs. State of Punjab (2011) 3 SCC 521 has been\r\nre\u2212affirmed. It is lastly urged that the concurrent findings are not normally required to be interfered\r\nwith unless there is a perversity. Reliance is placed on the judgments of this Court in State of U.P.\r\nvs. Krishna Gopal (1988) 4 SCC 302, Ganga Kumar Srivastava vs. State of Bihar (2005) 6 SCC 211,\r\nJarnail Singh (supra) and S.K. Sakkar vs. State of West Bengal (2021) 4 SCC 483. In reply to the\r\ncontention of the appellant regarding not having any connection of the vehicle with the accused to\r\nprove his guilt, reliance is placed on a judgment of this Court in Rizwan Khan vs. State ofChhattisgarh (2020) 9 SCC 627, however prayed for dismissal of appeal.\r\n11. After hearing and on perusal of record and the evidence brought, it is apparent that on\r\napprehending the accused, while making search of the motor cycle, 900 gm of smack was seized to\r\nwhich seizure and sample memos were prepared, as proved by the departmental witnesses. In the\r\nfacts of the case at hand, where the search and seizure was made from the vehicle used, by way of\r\nchance recovery from public road, the provisions of Section 43 of the NDPS Act would apply. In this\r\nregard, the guidance may be taken from the judgments of this Court in S. K. Raju (supra) and S.K.\r\nSakkar (supra). However, the recovery made by Pranveer Singh (PW6) cannot be doubted in the\r\nfacts of this case.\r\n12. Now reverting to the contention that the motor cycle seized in commission of offence does not\r\nbelong to accused, however seizure of the contraband from the motor cycle cannot be connected to\r\nprove the guilt of accused. The Trial Court on appraisal of the testimony of witnesses, Constable\r\nPreetam Singh (PW1), Constable Sardar Singh (PW2), S.I. Pranveer Singh (PW6) and\r\nConstableRajendra Prasad (PW8), who were members of the patrolling team and the witnesses of\r\nthe seizure, proved beyond reasonable doubt, when they were on patrolling, the appellant came\r\ndriving the seized vehicle from opposite side. On seeing the police vehicle, he had taken back the\r\nmotor cycle which he was riding. However, the police team apprehended and intercepted the\r\naccused and made the search of vehicle, in which the seized contraband smack was found beneath\r\nthe seat of the vehicle. However, while making search at public place, the contraband was seized\r\nfrom the motor cycle driven by the accused. Thus, recovery of the contraband from the motor cycle\r\nof the appellant was a chance recovery on a public road. As per Section 43 of NDPS Act, any officer\r\nof any of the departments, specified in Section 42, is having power of seizure and arrest of the\r\naccused from a public place, or in transit of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or\r\ncontrolled substance. The said officer may detain in search any person whom he has reason to\r\nbelieve that he has committed an offence punishable under the provisions of the NDPS Act, in case\r\nthe possession of the narcotic drug or psychotropic substance appears to be unlawful. Learned\r\nsenior counsel representing the appellant is unable to show any deficiency in following the\r\nprocedure or perversity to the findings recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the High Court. The\r\nseizure of the motor cycle from him is proved beyond reasonable doubt, therefore, the question of\r\nownership of vehicle is not relevant. In the similar set of facts, in the case of Rizwan Khan (supra),\r\nthis Court observed the ownership of the vehicle is immaterial. Therefore, the argument as advanced\r\nby learned senior counsel is of no substance and meritless.\r\n13. At this state, the argument advanced by the appellant regarding non\u2212production of contraband\r\nin the court due to which benefit of doubt ought to be given to accused, is required to be adverted to.\r\nIn the case of State of Rajasthan vs. Sahi Ram (2019) 10 SCC 649, this Court held that when the\r\nseizure of material is proved on record and is not even disputed, the entire contraband material\r\nneed not be placed on record. It is not a case in which the appellant has proved beyond reasonable\r\ndoubt that while sending the samples for forensic tests, seals were not intact or the procedure has\r\nbeen materially not followed by protecting the seized substance or was not stored properly, as\r\nspecified in the case of Mohan Lal (supra) in which case the directions were given to be followed on\r\nadministrative side. However, in the facts of the case, the said judgment is not of any help to\r\nappellant.\r\n14. Similarly, in the case of Than Kumar vs. State of Haryana (2020) 5 SCC 260, this Court observed\r\nthat if seizure is otherwise proved and the samples taken from and out of contraband material were\r\nkept intact; the report of forensic expert shows potency, nature and quality of contraband material,\r\nessential ingredients constituting offence are made out and the non\u2212production of contraband in\r\nthe Court is not fatal. As discussed above, the appellant has failed to show that findings recorded by\r\ntwo Courts suffer from any perversity or illegality on the said issue and warrant interference\r\n15. Simultaneously, the arguments advanced by the appellant regarding non\u2212compliance of Section\r\n50 of NDPS Act is bereft of any merit because no recovery of contraband from the person of the\r\naccused has been made to which compliance of the provision of Section 50 NDPS Act has to follow\r\nmandatorily. In the present case, in the search of motor cycle at public place, the seizure of\r\ncontraband was made, as revealed. Therefore, compliance of Section 50 does not attract in the\r\npresent case. It is settled in the case of Vijaysinh (supra) that in the case of personal search only, the\r\nprovisions of Section 50 of the Act is required to be complied with but not in the case of vehicle as in\r\nthe present case, following the judgments of Surinder Kumar (supra) and Baljinder Singh (supra).\r\nConsidering the facts of this Court, the argument of non\u2212compliance of Section 50 of NDPS Act\r\nadvanced by the counsel is hereby repelled.\r\n16. The issue raised regarding conviction solely relying upon the testimony of police witnesses,\r\nwithout procuring any independent witness, recorded by the two courts, has also been dealt with by\r\nthis Court in the case of Surinder Kumar (supra) holding that merely because independent witnesses\r\nwere not examined, the conclusion could not be drawn that accused was falsely implicated.\r\nTherefore, the said issue is also well\u2212settled and in particular, looking to the facts of the present\r\ncase, when the conduct of the accused was found suspicious and a chance recovery from the vehicle\r\nused by him is made from public place and proved beyond reasonable doubt, the appellant cannot\r\navail any benefit on this issue. . In our view, the concurrent findings of the courts does not call for\r\ninterference.\r\n17. It is to observe that as per the judgment of Krishna Gopal (supra), it is held that interference in\r\nexercise of the power under Article 136 of the Constitution of India can only be called for when the\r\njudgment of the lower court is vitiated by gross error. This Court is having an occasion to reconsider\r\nthe said issue in the case of Ganga Kumar Srivastava (supra), whereby it is settled that interference\r\ncan be made when a question of law of general public importance arises or a decision shocks the\r\nconscience of the Court. It is held that in case, the finding is vitiated by any error of law or procedure\r\nor found contrary to the principles of natural justice, and misreading of the evidence, or where the\r\nconclusions of the High Court are manifestly perverse and unsupportable from the evidence on\r\nrecord, interference under Article 136 can be called for. The said principle has again been reiterated\r\nin the case of Jarnail Singh (supra), reaffirming the law as laid down in Ganga Kumar Srivastava\r\n(supra). Recently also, in the case of S.K. Sakkar (supra), this Court has reaffirmed the issue of scope\r\nof interference in exercise of power by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.\r\n18. In view of the foregoing discussion, looking to the facts of the present case, in our considered\r\nopinion, the findings concurrently recorded by the Courts holding the accused guilty for the charges\r\nand to direct him to undergo sentence as prescribed, do not suffer from any perversity, illegality,\r\nwarranting interference by this Court.\r\n19. Accordingly, we do not find any merit in this appeal. Hence, it is dismissed. As the appellant has\r\nalready served the sentence so awarded and released after deposit of the amount of fine, therefore,\r\nno further directions need be issued.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.

          "judgement":"R. Subhash Reddy, J.\r\n1. Leave granted.\r\n2. This criminal appeal is filed by the applicant in Application No.27662 of 2019, aggrieved by the\r\norder dated 18.07.2019 passed by the High Court of Allahabad, dismissing her application filed\r\nunder Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC).\r\n3. That on 11.05.2018, an FIR bearing Case Crime No.278\/2018 was registered at P.S. T.P. Nagar\r\nPolice Station, District Meerut on the complaint of Vijaydeep (complainant and brother of the\r\ndeceased) Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of 2019 under Sections 328, 302, IPC and 3(2)(v) of The\r\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short, \u2018the Act\u2019),\r\nalleging that his brother Vikas (deceased) was called by the appellant \u2013 Kanchan Sharma on\r\n04.05.2018 at her house. At that point of time his brother was on duty at PVM Logistic Company\r\nand on such call, he went to the house of the appellant, wherein the appellant\u2019s father, mother and\r\nsister met his brother and all of them abused his brother with casteist abuses and forcefully\r\nadministered poison to him and consequently his brother became unconscious. Complainant further\r\nstated that his brother was taken to hospital and due to the negligence of the hospital, he died.\r\n4. Initially FIR was registered for offences punishable under Sections 328, 302 of IPC and Section\r\n3(2)(v) of the Act against the appellant, her brother and sister. After investigation, final report was\r\nfiled only against the appellant for the offence under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the Act.\r\nOn filing such final report, cognizance was taken against the appellant and on 21.02.2019 non\u2212\r\nbailable warrants were issued against the appellant. After filing of the final report, case was\r\nregistered against the appellant in Special Sessions Trial No.23 of 2019 (State v. Kanchan Sharma)\r\nunder Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the Act, which is pending on the file of the\r\nCrl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of 2019 Additional District & Sessions Judge \/ Special Judge, Scheduled\r\nCastes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Meerut.\r\n5. Appellant herein has approached the High Court for quashing of cognizance order \/ NBW issued\r\nagainst her as well as the criminal proceedings in Special Trial No.23 of 2019 pending on the file of\r\nthe Additional District & Sessions Judge \/ Special Judge, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes\r\n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, by way of application under Section 482, Cr.PC for quashing the\r\nproceedings. It was the case of the appellant before the High Court that no offence is made out\r\nagainst the appellant to proceed for trial for the alleged offence under Section 306, IPC and Section\r\n3(2)(v) of the Act. The High Court, by impugned order, has disposed of the petition mainly on the\r\nground that the disputed questions of fact cannot be adjudicated at this stage under Section 482,\r\nCr.PC.\r\n6. We have heard Sri Sanchit Garga, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri Aviral Saxena, learned\r\ncounsel for the 1 st respondent\u2212State. Though the 2nd respondent\u2212complainant is served, there is\r\nno appearance on his behalf before this Court.\r\n7. Sri Garga, learned counsel for the appellant has mainly contended that there is absolutely no basis\r\nto proceed against the appellant for alleged offence under Section 306, IPC and Section 3(2)\r\nCrl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of 2019\r\n(v) of the Act. It is submitted that except that the appellant was harassed by the deceased by\r\nfollowing her and proposing marriage with him there is absolutely no basis to allege that the\r\nappellant has abetted the suicide of the deceased. It is submitted that on the day of incident, i.e.,\r\n04.05.2018 deceased came to the house of the appellant and started shouting that he would marry\r\nthe appellant and if her marriage was not solemnized he would consume poison. Within no time\r\nthereafter he consumed poison from a small bottle which he was holding in his hand and fell\r\nunconscious and thereafter died in the hospital. It is submitted that in absence of any of the\r\ningredients of Section 306\/107, IPC, appellant cannot be subjected to trial for the offence under\r\nSection 306, IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the Act. It is submitted that by considering the material as itis on record even the offence under Section 3(2)(v) of the Act is not made out.\r\n8. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1\u2212State has submitted that the deceased\r\nwas maintaining relation with the appellant. As she has refused to marry the deceased, deceased has\r\ncommitted suicide by consuming poison. In view of the relation maintained by her, it amounts to\r\nabetment for committing the suicide by the deceased within the meaning of Section 306 of IPC. It is\r\nfurther submitted that the appellant and other members of the family Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of\r\n2019 have abused the deceased by uttering casteist words, as such, appellant is rightly sought to be\r\nprosecuted for the offence under Section 3(2)(v) of the Act.\r\n9. Having heard learned counsel on both sides, we have perused the impugned order and other\r\nmaterial placed on record. Except the self\u2212serving statements of the complainant and other\r\nwitnesses stating that deceased was in love with the appellant, there is no other material to show\r\nthat appellant was maintaining any relation with the deceased. From the material placed on record\r\nit is clear that on the date of incident on 04.05.2018 deceased went to the house of the appellant and\r\nconsumed poison by taking out from a small bottle which he has carried in his pocket. Merely\r\nbecause he consumed poison in front of the house of the appellant, that itself will not indicate any\r\nrelation of the appellant with the deceased. \u2018Abetment\u2019 involves mental process of instigating a\r\nperson or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without positive act on the part of the\r\naccused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, no one can be convicted for offence under Section\r\n306, IPC. To proceed against any person for the offence under Section 306 IPC it requires an active\r\nact or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide, seeing no Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of\r\n2019 option and that act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he\r\ncommitted suicide. There is nothing on record to show that appellant was maintaining relation with\r\nthe deceased and further there is absolutely no material to allege that appellant abetted for suicide\r\nof the deceased within the meaning of Section 306, IPC. Even with regard to offence alleged under\r\nSection 3(2)(v) of the Act it is to be noticed that except vague and bald statement that the appellant\r\nand other family members abused deceased by uttering casteist words but there is nothing on record\r\nto show to attract any of the ingredients for the alleged offence also. This Court in the case of\r\nChitresh Kumar Chopra v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)1 had an occasion to deal with the aspect of\r\nabetment. In the said case this Court has opined that there should be an intention to provoke, incite\r\nor encourage the doing of an act by the accused. Besides, the judgment also observed that each\r\nperson\u2019s suicidability pattern is different from the other and each person has his own idea of self\u2212\r\nesteem and self\u2212respect. In the said judgment it is held that it is impossible to lay down any\r\nstraightjacket formula dealing with the cases of suicide and each case has to be decided on the basis\r\nof its own facts and circumstances. In the case of 1 (2009) 16 SCC 605 Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of\r\n2019 Amalendu Pal @ Jhantu v. State of West Bengal2 in order to bring a case within the purview of\r\nSection 306, IPC this Court has held as under :\r\n\u201C12. Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that before holding an accused\r\nguilty of an offence under Section 306 IPC, the court must scrupulously examine the\r\nfacts and circumstances of the case and also assess the evidence adduced before it in\r\norder to find out whether the cruelty and harassment meted out to the victim had left\r\nthe victim with no other alternative but to put an end to her life. It is also to be bornein mind that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or\r\nindirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of\r\nharassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time of\r\noccurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the person to commit\r\nsuicide, conviction in terms of Section 306 IPC is not sustainable.\r\n13. In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC there must be a\r\ncase of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to\r\nhave abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of\r\ninstigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore,\r\nthe act of abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be proved and\r\nestablished by the prosecution before he could be convicted under Section 306 IPC.\u201D\r\nIn the judgment in the case of S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan & Anr.3 this\r\nCourt reiterated the ingredients of offence of Section 306 IPC. Paragraph 25 of the\r\njudgment reads as under :\r\n\u201C25. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally\r\naiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive\r\n2 (2010) 1 SCC 707 3 (2010) 12 SCC 190 Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of 2019 act on the part of the\r\naccused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of\r\nthe legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear that in order to convict a\r\nperson under Section 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also\r\nrequires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and\r\nthat act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed\r\nsuicide.\u201D In the judgment in the case of Rajiv Thapar & Ors. v. Madan Lal Kapur4 this Court has\r\nconsidered the scope of the provision under Section 482, Cr.PC and has laid down the steps which\r\nshould be followed by the High Court to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashing of\r\nproceedings in exercise of power under Section 482, Cr.PC. Paragraph 30 containing the four steps\r\nread as under :\r\n\u201C30. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate\r\nthe following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashment raised by an\r\naccused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 CrPC:\r\n30.1.Step one: whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable,\r\nand indubitable i.e. the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?\r\n30.2.Step two: whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out the\r\nassertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused i.e. the material is\r\nsufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint i.e.\r\nthe material is such as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn\r\nthe factual basis of the accusations as false?\r\n30.3.Step three: whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been\r\nrefuted by the prosecution\/complainant; and\/or the\r\n4 (2013) 3 SCC 330 Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of 2019 material is such that it cannot be justifiably\r\nrefuted by the prosecution\/complainant?\r\n30.4.Step four: whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court,\r\nand would not serve the ends of justice?\r\n30.5. If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, the judicial conscience of the High Court\r\nshould persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings in exercise of power vested in it under\r\nSection 482 CrPC. Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious\r\ncourt time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as proceedings arising\r\ntherefrom) specially when it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the\r\naccused.\u201D\r\n10. By applying the aforesaid ratio decided by this Court, we have carefully scrutinized the material\r\non record and examined the facts of the case on hand. Except the statement that the deceased was in\r\nrelation with the appellant, there is no material at all to show that appellant was maintaining any\r\nrelation with the deceased. In fact, at earlier point of time when the deceased was stalking the\r\nappellant, the appellant along with her father went to the police station complained about the calls\r\nwhich were being made by the deceased to the appellant. Same is evident from the statement of S.I.\r\nManoj Kumar recorded on 05.07.2018. In his statement recorded he has clearly deposed that the\r\nfather along with the appellant went to the police post and complained against the deceased who\r\nwas continuously Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of 2019 calling the appellant and proposing that she\r\nshould marry him with a threat that he will die otherwise. Having regard to such material placed on\r\nrecord and in absence of any material within the meaning of Section 107 of IPC, there is absolutely\r\nno basis to proceed against the appellant for the alleged offence under Section 306 IPC and Section\r\n3(2)(v) of the Act. It would be travesty of justice to compel the appellant to face a criminal trial\r\nwithout any credible material whatsoever.\r\n11. In view of the same, we are of the view that the High Court has committed error in rejecting the\r\napplication filed by the appellant by merely recording a finding that in view of the factual disputes\r\nsame cannot be decided in a petition under Section 482, Cr.PC.\r\n12. For the aforesaid reasons, this appeal is allowed and Order dated 18.07.2019 passed by the High\r\nCourt of Allahabad in Application No.27662 of 2019 is set aside. Consequently, the said application\r\nstands allowed by quashing the order\/NBW dated 21.02.2019 as well as proceedings of Special Trial\r\nNo.23 of 2019 (State v. Kanchan Sharma) arising out of Crime No.0278 of 2018 under Section 306,\r\nIPC and 3(2)(v) of The Scheduled Castes and the Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7554 of 2019 Scheduled\r\nTribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 pending in the court of Additional District & Sessions\r\nJudge \/ Special Judge (SC & ST Act), Meerut.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.

          "judgement":"M.R. SHAH, J.\r\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 08.09.2017\r\npassed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.\r\n18308 of 2017, by which the High Court has dismissed the said writ petition preferred by the\r\nappellants herein, filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, for quashing the first\r\ninformation report registered as Case Crime No. 790 of 2017, under Sections 420\/406 IPC, Police\r\nStation Loni Border, District Ghaziabad, the original writ petitioners\/accused have preferred the\r\npresent appeal.\r\n2. The relevant facts necessary for deciding the present appeal are as under:\r\nThat one M\/s Varun Beverages Ltd. (for short, \u2018VBL\u2019) is a licensed franchisee of\r\nPepsiCo India Pvt. Ltd. and engaged in the manufacture and sale of carbonated\r\nsweetened water, fruit juice, packaged drinking water under the PepsiCo brand. That\r\nin the year 2013, the VBL appointed the firm of the complainant \u2013 Sanjay Sharma as\r\na Distributor in the area of Loni, District Ghaziabad to sell and distribute the\r\nproducts manufactured by the company. That in the year 2014, the company\r\nterminated the contract of distributorship, which according to the appellants was due\r\nto non-payment of dues by respondent no.1 herein \u2013 original complainant. According\r\nto the appellants, thereafter on reconciliation of accounts and as per the statement ofaccounts maintained by the company, after adjusting of all claims and security\r\ndeposit, a sum of Rs.9,46,280\/- was found to be outstanding upon the complainant,\r\ntowards the material supplied to him. The complainant issued a cheque dated\r\n15.09.2014 in favour of the company \u2013 VBL. The said cheque was presented for\r\nencashment on 22.09.2014. The same was dishonoured and returned unpaid by the\r\nbanker of the complainant due to \u201Cinsufficient funds\u201D. That thereafter, due to\r\nnon-payment after the issuance of the statutory legal notices, appellants herein filed a\r\ncriminal complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act on\r\n07.11.2014 against R1 and his company Thakur Trading, in the Court of Chief Judicial\r\nMagistrate, Ghaziabad being Complaint Case No. 7652\/2014. R1 has been summoned\r\nto face the trial. The said complaint is presently pending for disposal. R1 filed a\r\ncomplaint against one of the officers of the company-VBL being FIR No. 1565\/2014\r\ndated 15.09.2014 alleging misappropriation of Rs.6,00,000\/- by one of the officers of\r\nthe company, namely, Vipul Verma. That after investigation by the police, the\r\ninvestigating officer submitted a negative final report No. 47\/2015 dated 20.01.2015.\r\n2.1 R1 also filed one another case on 09.02.2015 for misappropriation of\r\nRs.31,12,375\/- by the appellants. That thereafter R1 filed a complaint\/application\r\nunder Section 156(3) Cr. P.C. in the Court of learned Additional Chief Judicial\r\nMagistrate-I, Ghaziabad for issuance of direction to the Police Station Loni to register\r\nFIR against the appellants herein and two other officers of the company alleging\r\nmisappropriation of an amount of Rs.31,12,375\/-. The learned Magistrate, instead of\r\ndirecting the police to register FIR, decided to enquire into the matter by treating the\r\nsame as a complaint case. That vide order dated 23.03.2015, the learned Magistrate\r\ntreated the application of R1 under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. as a complaint case and an\r\nopportunity was granted to R1 to record his statement under Section 200 Cr.P.C.\r\n2.2 Feeling aggrieved by order dated 23.03.2015 treating the application under\r\nSection 156(3) Cr.P.C. as a complaint case, R1 filed a criminal revision application\r\nNo. 70\/2015 before the learned Sessions Court, Ghaziabad. That the learned Sessions\r\nJudge, Ghaziabad allowed the said revision application and quashed and set aside\r\norder dated 23.03.2015 passed by the learned Magistrate and remanded the matter\r\nback to the learned Magistrate to consider the material on record and pass speaking\r\norder afresh for assigning reasons for considering application under Section 156(3)\r\nCr.P.C. as a complaint case. That thereafter the learned Magistrate sought an action\r\nreport from the concerned police station. That the concerned police officer submitted\r\nthe report before the learned Magistrate on 09.08.2015. That the said proceedings\r\nare pending before the learned Magistrate.\r\n2.3 That after a period of approximately two years, R1 lodged the impugned FIR\r\nagainst the appellants for the offences under Sections 406\/420 IPC at Police Station\r\nLoni, District Ghaziabad, dated 4.8.2017. The allegations in the said FIR are\r\nsame\/similar to the allegations levelled in the application under Section 156(3)\r\nCr.P.C., which is pending consideration before the learned Magistrate since 2015.At this stage, it is required to be noted that the said FIR is filed against Kapil Agarwal, appellant\r\nNo.1 \u2013 Director, Sharad Garg, appellant No.2 \u2013 Multi Unit Manager and Deepak Sharma, appellant\r\nNo.3 \u2013 Sales Head. That thereafter the appellants approached the High Court under Article 226 of\r\nthe Constitution of India being Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 18308 of 2017 for\r\nquashing the aforesaid FIR being Case Crime No. 790 of 2017, under Sections 420\/406 IPC, Police\r\nStation Loni Border, District Ghaziabad. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has\r\nrefused to quash the FIR observing that the impugned FIR, prima facie, discloses commission of\r\ncognizable offence.\r\n2.4 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High\r\nCourt refusing to quash the FIR being Case Crime No. 790 of 2017, under Sections 420\/406 IPC,\r\nPolice Station Loni Border, District Ghaziabad, the original accused have preferred the present\r\nappeal.\r\n3. Shri K.V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants has\r\nvehemently submitted that the impugned FIR is an abuse of process of law to harass the appellants\r\nby converting a purely civil dispute into a criminal case.\r\n3.1 It is submitted that the contents of the FIR show that it has been registered for recovery of\r\ncommission and discounts on sale which alleged to have taken in the regular business transactions\r\nplace over a period of 15 months between the parties. Hence, it is a purely contractual dispute on the\r\nface of it. 3.2 It is submitted that no civil proceedings have been filed by the complainant for\r\nrecovery of the alleged due amount. It is submitted that the impugned FIR has been lodged solely\r\nwith a view to arm twist and extort money from the appellants.\r\n3.3 It is further submitted that there is not even a whisper about the pendency of the application\r\nunder Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. pending before the learned Magisterial Court, in the FIR. Nor is there\r\nany mention of the fact that there is an ongoing case under Section 138 of the NI Act.\r\n3.4 It is submitted that the police report in respect of Section 156(3) application has gone against\r\nhim, R1 has left the earlier proceedings lying pending for two years without participating in it and\r\nhas filed a fresh FIR with the same allegations. It is submitted that the fresh FIR on the same\r\nallegations has been filed only with a view to get the appellants arrested and extort the money from\r\nthe appellants.\r\n3.5 Relying upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P. (2000) 2\r\nSCC 636 and Jetking Infotrain Ltd. v. State of U.P. (2015) 11 SCC 730, it is submitted that in view of\r\nthe pendency of the complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act and the subsequent FIR is a\r\ncounter-blast to the same, the present prosecution would be clearly an abuse of process of law and\r\ntherefore the impugned FIR deserves to be quashed and set aside. 3.6 Relying upon the decision of\r\nthis Court in the case of Uma Shankar Gopalika v. State of Bihar (2005) 10 SCC 336, it is submitted\r\nthat as the dispute can be said to be a purely civil dispute, which has been given a criminal colour,\r\nthe same deserves to be quashed and set aside.\r\n3.7 It is further submitted that even taking the allegations in the impugned FIR at the face value, no\r\noffence under Sections 406\/420 IPC is made out against the appellants. It is submitted that at best,\r\nthe impugned FIR alleges that R1 entrusted certain monies to the company which the company did\r\nnot pay to him at his request. It is submitted that the company \u2013 VBL is not even made an accused\r\nand the appellants are joined as an accused in their individual capacity as Director, Multi Unit\r\nManager and Sales Head. It is submitted that in order to make out a case under Section 406 IPC\r\nagainst the appellants, there must be an allegation that R1 entrusted the appellants in their personal\r\ncapacities, not as VBL officers, with the relevant commissions\/benefits. 3.8 It is further submitted\r\nthat even from the bare perusal of the contents of the impugned FIR, the essential ingredients of\r\noffence of cheating under Section 420 IPC are completely missing. It is submitted that there is no\r\nallegation that the appellants either, (a) deceived R1 by making any false or misleading\r\nrepresentation; or dishonestly concealed some matter from R1; or by any other act or omission; (b)\r\nfraudulently or dishonestly induced R1 to deliver the cheques allegedly handed over as security, or\r\nto agree to entrust the claimed commissions\/benefits to VBL; or to do or omit to do anything which\r\nR1 would not have done or omitted to have done if he were not deceived. Reliance is placed on the\r\ndecisions of this Court in the case of Mohd. Ibrahim v. State of Bihar (2009) 8 SCC 751; in the case\r\nof Vesa Holdings (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala (2015) 8 SCC 293; in the case of Robert John D\u2019Souza v.\r\nStephen V. Gomes (2015) 9 SCC 96; and State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 33.\r\n3.9 It is further submitted that even as per the allegations in the FIR, the amount is due from the\r\ncompany and not from the appellants. There is no entrustment or retention personally by any of the\r\nappellants. It is submitted that as held by this Court in the cases of S.K. Alagh v. State of U.P. (2008)\r\n5 SCC 662, Sardar Singh v. State of Haryana (1977) 1 SCC 463 and Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat\r\n(2008) 5 SCC 688, even when a case under Section 406 IPC is made out against a company,\r\nvicarious liability cannot be extended to the Directors or officers of a company.\r\n3.10 It is submitted that as the main allegations are against the company and the company had not\r\nbeen made as an accused in the FIR, the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. Reliance is\r\nplaced upon the decision of this Court in the case of Sushil Sethi v. State of Arunachal Pradesh\r\n(2020) 3 SCC 240. 3.11 Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is\r\nprayed to allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the criminal proceedings and FIR being\r\nCase Crime No. 790 of 2017, under Sections 420\/406 IPC, Police Station Loni Border, District\r\nGhaziabad, as the same is nothing but an abuse of process of law.\r\n4. The present appeal is opposed by Shri M.C. Dhingra, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the\r\nrespondent \u2013 original complainant. 4.1 It is submitted that as the FIR discloses commission of\r\ncognizable offence, the High Court has rightly refused to quash the FIR, in exercise of powers under\r\nArticle 226 of the Constitution of India.\r\n4.2 It is submitted that initially having failed to get the money due and payable to the complainant,\r\nthe complainant was constrained to make an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the\r\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate at Ghaziabad. However, without referring to the allegations of the\r\noffences under Sections 420, 406, 467, 468, 471, 34\/120-B IPC, the learned Magistrate vide a very\r\ncryptic order dated 23.03.2015 directed for treating the application under Section 156(3) as acomplaint case under Section 200 Cr.P.C. Aggrieved, the complainant preferred criminal revision\r\nbefore the learned Sessions Court, which on 8.7.2015 set aside order dated 23.03.2015 and\r\nremanded the case back to the learned Magistrate to consider the material on record and decide the\r\ncomplainant\u2019s application under Section 156(3) afresh by a reasoned order. It is submitted that once\r\nagain a closure report was submitted by the very same investigating officer who earlier submitted\r\nthe closure report. It is submitted that as the learned Magistrate did not pass any order on the\r\nclosure report and kept the application under Section 156(3) under consideration for long, much to\r\nthe agony of the complainant craving justice, the complainant was constrained to file the impugned\r\nFIR, making serious allegations against the company and its officers \u2013 appellants herein. It is\r\nsubmitted that, however, the police arrayed the appellants as an accused for the offences under\r\nSections 420\/406 IPC, although the facts therein disclosed commission of offences under Sections\r\n467, 468, 471 IPC for forging complainant\u2019s blank cheque No. 038611, out of five blank cheques\r\nlying with the company as security and sought to encash it but could not succeed as the cheque was\r\ndishonoured. It is submitted that the company owed Rs.31,12,375.06 towards commission to be paid\r\nto the complainant \u2013 respondent which was lying in trust with it, but did not pay to him and thus by\r\ncheating him also committed breach of trust. It is submitted that in the FIR, it was also alleged that\r\non demanding money they extended threats to get him killed and therefore the impugned FIR also\r\ndiscloses commission of an offence under Section 506 IPC as well.\r\n4.3 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the appellants that there is an unexplained delay of\r\ntwo years in lodging the impugned FIR, it is submitted that as such there is no delay in registration\r\nof the FIR. It is submitted that delay is a mixed question of fact and law and a plea of defence. It can\r\nbe explained at the trial. It is submitted that belated registration of FIR is always not fatal to the\r\nprosecution in every case as it is explainable at the trial. It is submitted that it is not a thumb rule to\r\nquash FIR for delayed registration, which can be explained at the trial.\r\n4.4 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the appellants that FIR could not be registered during\r\nthe pendency of the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. on the same set of allegations, it is\r\nsubmitted that Section 210 Cr.P.C. leaves no doubt that FIR under Section 154 Cr.P.C. can be\r\nregistered during the pendency of the complaint case on the very same set of facts\/allegations. It is\r\nsubmitted that quashing of FIR will lead to demolition of complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.\r\npending consideration before the learned Magistrate. 4.5 It is further submitted that despite the fact\r\nthat the FIR discloses commission of offences under Sections 467, 468, 471, 34\/120-B IPC also, the\r\npolice have registered FIR under Sections 420\/406 IPC only. It is submitted that the trial Court can\r\nadd charges under Sections 467, 468, 471, 34\/120-B IPC in exercise of powers under Section 216\r\nCr.P.C. at any time before rendering judgment.\r\n4.6 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the appellants for non- disclosure of the pending\r\napplication under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in the FIR is concerned, it is submitted that it is a settled\r\nlaw that FIR is not an encyclopaedia. It is submitted that even otherwise non-mentioning of the\r\npendency of the complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. does not prejudice the appellants in any\r\nmanner. It is submitted that even otherwise as per Section 210 Cr.P.C., the proceedings before the\r\nMagistrate during pendency of the investigation by the police in the FIR are required to be stayed by\r\nthe learned Magistrate. It is submitted that the subsequent registration of FIR on the very same setof allegations, as in the pending complaint, does not confront any law. 4.7 Now so far as the\r\nsubmission on behalf of the appellants that the company is not joined as an accused in the FIR is\r\nconcerned, it is submitted that, as such, police ought to have included the company as an accused\r\nwith the appellants in the FIR. It is submitted that the appellants named in the FIR have not\r\ndisputed that they are principal functionaries of the company and had been responsible for the\r\noperations of complainant\u2019s dealership in all respects. It is submitted that the appellants cannot\r\ndraw any benefit for absence of company as their co-accused. Company can be arrayed as an\r\naccused by the police in the chargesheet after collecting evidence. It is submitted that even if by any\r\nchance the police omit to do so, the trial Court has powers under Section 319 Cr.P.C. to summon the\r\ncompany to stand trial as co-accused.\r\n4.8 It is further submitted that the accused did not get immunity for the offence committed by them\r\nmerely because they have made complaint against the complainant under Section 138 NI Act. It is\r\nsubmitted that otherwise all cross criminal cases would be rebuffed if such contention is accepted.\r\n4.9 It is further submitted that as such the appellants have acknowledged through emails as also\r\nthrough duly signed hard copies that Rs. 34,50,418\/- is payable to the respondent by way of\r\ncommission, incentives and discounts etc. This amount was retained by the appellants and the\r\ncompany in trust upon conclusion of the dealership. The company and the appellants have not paid\r\nthe said amount and thereby have cheated the respondent and also committed breach of trust. It is\r\nsubmitted that the appellants are now speciously disputing the said acknowledgement. It is\r\nsubmitted that merely because the acknowledgements through emails and hard copies are now\r\ndisputed by the appellants, it will not result in quashing the FIR.\r\n4.10 Making the above submissions and submitted that as the FIR discloses commission of\r\ncognizable offences, the same may not be quashed at the threshold in exercise of powers under\r\nArticle 226 of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that as held by this Court in catena of\r\ndecisions that the power under Article 226 of the Constitution and\/or under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to\r\nquash the FIR at the threshold is required to be exercised sparingly. It is submitted that it is not a fit\r\ncase to exercise the power under Article 226 of the Constitution to quash the FIR when the FIR\r\ndiscloses commission of cognizable offences.\r\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.\r\nIt is the case on behalf of the appellants that as on the same allegations, the private\r\nrespondent-complainant has filed an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., which is pending\r\nbefore the learned Magistrate, the impugned FIR with the same allegations and averments would\r\nnot be maintainable, and therefore, the FIR lodged with the police station Loni Border, District\r\nGhaziabad deserves to be quashed and set aside. The aforesaid cannot be accepted for the simple\r\nreason that Code of Criminal Procedure permits such an eventuality of a complaint case and enquiry\r\nor trial by the Magistrate in a complaint case and an investigation by the police pursuant to the FIR.\r\nAt this stage, Section 210 Cr.P.C. is required to be referred to, which reads as under:\r\n\u201C210. Procedure to be followed when there is a complaint case and police\r\ninvestigation in respect of the same offence \u2013 (1) When in a case instituted otherwise\r\nthan on a police report (hereinafter referred to as a complaint case), it is made to\r\nappear to the Magistrate, during the course of the inquiry or trial held by him, that an\r\ninvestigation by the police is in progress in relation to the offence which is the\r\nsubject- matter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall stay the\r\nproceedings of such inquiry or trial and call for a report on the matter from the police\r\nofficer conducting the investigation. (2) If a report is made by the investigating police\r\nofficer under section 173 and on such report cognizance of any offence is taken by the\r\nMagistrate against any person who is an accused in the complaint case, the\r\nMagistrate shall inquire into or try together the complaint case and the case arising\r\nout of the police report as if both the cases were instituted on a police report. (3) If\r\nthe police report does not relate to any accused in the complaint case or if the\r\nMagistrate does not take cognizance of any offence on the police report, he shall\r\nproceed with the inquiry or trial, which was stayed by him, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of this Code.\u201D Thus, as per Section 210 Cr.P.C., when in a case instituted\r\notherwise than on a police report, i.e., in a complaint case, during the course of the\r\ninquiry or trial held by the Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate that an\r\ninvestigation by the police is in progress in relation to the offence which is the subject\r\nmatter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall stay the proceedings of\r\nsuch inquiry or trial and call for a report on the matter from the police officer\r\nconducting the investigation. It also provides that if a report is made by the\r\ninvestigating police officer under Section 173 Cr.P.C. and on such report cognizance\r\nof any offence is taken by the Magistrate against any person who is an accused in the\r\ncomplaint case, the Magistrate shall inquire into or try together the complaint case\r\nand the case arising out of the police report as if both the cases were instituted on a\r\npolice report. It also further provides that if the police report does not relate to any\r\naccused in the complaint case or if the Magistrate does not take cognizance of any\r\noffence on the police report, he shall proceed with the inquiry or trial, which was\r\nstayed by him, in accordance with the provisions of Cr.P.C.\r\nThus, merely because on the same set of facts with the same allegations and averments earlier the\r\ncomplaint is filed, there is no bar to lodge the FIR with the police station with the same allegations\r\nand averments.\r\n6. However, at the same time, if it is found that the subsequent FIR is an abuse of process of law\r\nand\/or the same has been lodged only to harass the accused, the same can be quashed in exercise of\r\npowers under Article 226 of the Constitution or in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. In\r\nthat case, the complaint case will proceed further in accordance with the provisions of the Cr.P.C.\r\n6.1 As observed and held by this Court in catena of decisions, inherent jurisdiction under Section\r\n482 Cr.P.C. and\/or under Article 226 of the Constitution is designed to achieve salutary purpose\r\nthat criminal proceedings ought not to be permitted to degenerate into weapon of harassment.\r\nWhen the Court is satisfied that criminal proceedings amount to an abuse of process of law or that it\r\namounts to bringing pressure upon accused, in exercise of inherent powers, such proceedings can be\r\nquashed.6.2 As held by this Court in the case of Parbatbhai Aahir v. State of Gujarat (2017) 9 SCC 641,\r\nSection 482 Cr.P.C. is prefaced with an overriding provision. The statute saves the inherent power of\r\nthe High Court, as a superior court, to make such orders as are necessary (i) to prevent an abuse of\r\nthe process of any Court; or (ii) otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Same are the powers with the\r\nHigh Court, when it exercises the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution.\r\n7. Applying the law laid down by this Court, referred to hereinabove, to the facts of the case on hand,\r\nsubsequent FIR filed by the respondent \u2013 original complainant can be said to be an abuse of process\r\nof law and the same to be bringing pressure on the accused, which can be demonstrated from the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\ni) cheque no. 038611 was presented for encashment and the same came to be\r\ndishonoured by the banker of the complainant due to \u201Cinsufficient funds\u201D;\r\nii) that the company \u2013 VBL served statutory legal notices upon the complainant\r\nunder the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act;\r\niii) that thereafter complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act\r\nhas been filed by the company against the respondent-original complainant on\r\n7.11.2014;\r\niv) that thereafter, after a period of three months, respondent no.1 filed an\r\napplication under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. seeking registration of FIR against the\r\nappellants herein, i.e., in the month of February, 2015;\r\nv) the learned Magistrate declined to order registration of FIR, but decided to inquire\r\ninto the matter by treating the same as complaint case and granted respondent no.1 \u2013\r\noriginal complainant an opportunity of recording solemn affirmation under Section\r\n200 Cr.P.C. (order dated 23.03.2015). Order dated 23.03.2015 came to be set aside\r\nby the learned Sessions Judge vide order dated\r\n8.7.2015 and the matter was remanded to the learned Magistrate with directions to pass a speaking\r\norder. The same is pending before the learned Magistrate;\r\nvi) that thereafter after a period of two years, R1 lodged the impugned FIR against the appellants\r\nwith police station Loni Border, District Ghaziabad with the similar contents and allegations which\r\nwere levelled in the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. In the FIR, the date of occurrence of\r\nthe offence has been shown as 26.07.2017;\r\nvii) it appears that R1 is not proceeding further with his application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.,\r\nwhich is pending before the learned Magistrate since last five years;\r\nviii) in the FIR, neither there is any reference to the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. which\r\nis pending before the learned Magistrate, nor there is a reference of the complaint under Section 138of the NI Act.\r\nUnder the circumstances, the impugned FIR is nothing but an abuse of process of law and can be\r\nsaid to be filed with a view to harass the appellants.\r\n8. We are not expressing anything on merits whether, any case is made out against the appellants\r\nfor the offences alleged in 156(3) Cr.P.C. application as the same is pending before the learned\r\nMagistrate and the learned Magistrate is to take call on the same. Therefore, when the impugned\r\nFIR is nothing but an abuse of process of law and to harass the appellants-accused, we are of the\r\nopinion that the High Court ought to have exercised the powers under Article 226 of the\r\nConstitution of India\/482 Cr.P.C. and ought to have quashed the impugned FIR to secure the ends\r\nof justice.\r\n9. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal is allowed. The\r\nimpugned criminal proceedings\/FIR registered as Case Crime No. 790 of 2017, under Sections\r\n420\/406 IPC, with the police station Loni Border, District Ghaziabad are hereby quashed and set\r\naside on the aforesaid grounds. We make it clear that we have not expressed anything on merits on\r\nthe allegations made by respondent no.1 against the appellants as the proceedings in the form of\r\n156(3) Cr.P.C application are pending before the learned Magistrate. The learned Magistrate shall\r\nnow proceed further with the said application, in accordance with law and on its own merits.\r\nRespondent No.1 may proceed further with the said proceedings, if he so chooses and is advised.\r\n10. With these observations, the present appeal is allowed.\r\n \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.\r\n [Dr. Dhananjaya Y.

          "judgement":"M.R. SHAH, J.\r\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 29.07.2020\r\npassed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Application under Section 482 No. 1697 of\r\n2016, by which the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has quashed the\r\nentire proceedings of Criminal Case No. 3302 of 2015 under Sections 147, 148, 149, 406, 329 and\r\n386 IPC, P.S. Barra, District Kanpur Nagar, pending in the Court of I-Additional Chief Metropolitan\r\nMagistrate, Kanpur Nagar, the original complainant has preferred the present appeal.\r\n2. That the appellant herein filed a complaint before the learned Magisterial Court under Section\r\n156(3) Cr.P.C. against the private respondents for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149, 406,\r\n329 and 386 IPC; that the learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar, by\r\norder dated 07.09.2015, after perusal of the facts mentioned in the application\/complaint and\r\ndocuments and having found a prima facie case of cognizable offence and having observed that the\r\npolice is required to investigate the same, allowed the said application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.and directed the concerned Station House Officer to register the first information report and\r\ninvestigate it in accordance with law.\r\n2.1 That thereafter the concerned SHO registered the FIR as Case Crime No. 0645 of 2015 against\r\nthe private respondents herein for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149, 406, 329 and 386 IPC.\r\nAs per the allegations in the FIR, one Munni Devi was the owner of Plot No. 1342, W Block 2 Yojna\r\nJuhi Kala, Damodar Nagar, admeasuring 387 sq.ft.; that she appointed the complainant \u2013 Kaptan\r\nSingh as her power of attorney holder to take care of the said plot; that Munni Devi wanted to sell\r\nthe said plot; that she entered into a registered agreement to sell with one Mamta Gupta \u2013\r\nrespondent no. 3 herein on 27.10.2010 for a total sale consideration of Rs.25,00,000\/-; that at the\r\ntime of agreement, the purchaser \u2013 Mamta Gupta handed over five cheques of Rs. 2 lakh each,\r\ndrawn on ICICI Bank, Branch Govind Nagar, Kanpur; that Munni Devi presented one of the cheques\r\nno. 502314 dated 15.11.2010 in her bank and the said cheque was dishonoured \u201Cdue to insufficient\r\nfunds\u201D; that when the cheque returned unpaid, Munni Devi contacted Mamta Gupta and then she\r\ninformed her that her husband is suffering from kidney failure and facing financial problem and\r\ntherefore she would not be able to purchase the said plot, however she is arranging money; that\r\nthereafter Mamta Gupta showed no interest for registration of sale deed and she informed Munni\r\nDevi not to present the cheques; that thereafter Munni Devi served a legal notice dated 02.01.2015\r\nand 18.05.2015 through registered post; that after receiving notice dated 18.05.2015, Mamta Gupta\r\nshowed no positive response, then Munni Devi appointed the complainant as a power of attorney\r\nholder on 05.08.2015. 2.2 It was alleged that thereafter when the complainant along with his friend\r\nRam Pratap Singh went to the plot on 20.08.2015, at that time Mamta Gupta and her husband were\r\npresent there along with three other persons outside the tin shed. The complainant told them that\r\nthey have not paid the full consideration amount and had forcibly put lock on the room and\r\nrequested them to open the said lock. At that time, Mamta Gupta and her husband told them that\r\nthey had paid Rs. 2 lakhs and they will not open the lock till the time they will get Rs. 10 lakhs. It\r\nwas alleged that all the persons abused the complainant by using filthy language relating to his\r\nmother and sister and pushed the complainant due to which he fell down and thereafter he was\r\nbeaten with fist and Mamta Gupta, who was carrying knife like weapon, kept the edged part of it on\r\nhis chest and gave a blank paper and threatened him to sign it, if not, then he will be killed and the\r\ncomplainant signed it. The complainant also produced the medical report. That thereafter after the\r\ncompletion of the investigation and after recording of the statement of the witnesses, statement of\r\nthe complainant and after collecting the evidence from the place of incident and taking statement of\r\nindependent witnesses and even the statement of the accused persons, after due enquiry and having\r\nsatisfied that a prima facie case is made out against the accused for the offences under Sections 147,\r\n148, 149, 406, 329 and 386 IPC, the investigating officer filed chargesheet no. 320\/2015 dated\r\n26.11.2015 against the private respondents herein for the aforesaid offences.\r\n2.3 That thereafter the private respondents herein approached the High Court for quashing criminal\r\nproceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. It was the case on behalf of all the accused \u2013 private\r\nrespondents herein in the 482 petition that dispute is of a civil nature; that Munni Devi entered into\r\na registered agreement to sell on 27.10.2010 with Mamta Gupta as vendee; that Munni Devi\r\nundertook to get the land free hold done on the aforesaid plot and thereafter to execute the sale deed\r\nin favour of Mamta Gupta; that part payment was made immediately by cheque and cash both andthe remaining amount of Rs. 10 lakhs were to be paid at the time of execution of the sale deed; that\r\non the same date a joint notarized affidavit of Mamta Gupta and Munni Devi was also executed\r\ndemonstrating the payment of Rs. 25 lakhs by Mamta Gupta and the transfer of possession to\r\nMamta Gupta; that after obtaining possession Mamta Gupta constructed a two-room set on the said\r\nplot. It was also the case on behalf of the accused that thereafter Munni Devi did not get the free\r\nhold executed and since the husband of Mamta Gupta was suffering from a renal failure and was\r\nundergoing dialysis, she could not initiate legal proceedings for specific performance; that thereafter\r\nMunni Devi filed a suit in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Kanpur Nagar. It was also the\r\ncase on behalf of the private respondents \u2013 accused that as Munni Devi did not get any relief from\r\nthe court below, she got in touch with a land mafia \u2013 the original complainant \u2013 the appellant herein\r\nand he was the power of attorney holder of Munni Devi and that when he visited the plot on\r\n20.08.2015 he was thrown out and was assaulted. That thereafter Mamta Gupta filed a suit for\r\npermanent injunction being O.S. No. 2077 of 2015 in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division),\r\nKanpur Nagar wherein temporary injunction had been granted in favour of Mamta Gupta and the\r\nsaid order is still in operation. Therefore, it was submitted that the dispute is purely of a civil nature\r\nand criminal proceedings have been lodged only with a view to pressurize Mamta Gupta to handover\r\nthe plot to the complainant even though Mamta Gupta has paid a sum of Rs.25 lakhs to the owner of\r\nthe plot in question. Therefore, it was prayed to quash the entire FIR.\r\n3. That the 482 petition was opposed by the original complainant. A detailed affidavit\/counter\r\naffidavit was filed on behalf of the original complainant. It was specifically the case on behalf of the\r\ncomplainant that the documents alleged to have been executed by Munni Devi in favour of Mamta\r\nGupta on 27.10.2010\/subsequent notarized document dated 27.10.2010 are fabricated in which it is\r\nstated that Rs. 25 lakhs have been paid and that the possession has been handed over to Mamta\r\nGupta. It was also pointed out that for the aforesaid another first information report has been\r\nregistered against them on 04.12.2015, registered as Case Crime No. 816 of 2015 under Sections\r\n420, 467, 468, 471 IPC at Police Station Barra, District Kanpur Nagar and the investigation is still\r\ngoing on. It was also submitted that the electricity connection was obtained by Mamta Gupta in a\r\nfraudulent manner and subsequently the said electricity connection has been permanently\r\ndisconnected by Electricity Department, Kanpur Nagar on 18.08.2015 and no electric connection\r\nexists in the premises in question till today. It was also submitted that after the completion of the\r\ninvestigation and after collecting the credible evidence against the accused, the investigating officer\r\nhas submitted a chargesheet and the learned Magistrate after applying its mind judiciously has\r\ntaken cognizance against the accused. Therefore, it was prayed to dismiss 482 application.\r\n4. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has allowed the said application and has\r\nquashed the entire criminal proceedings mainly on the grounds that the original complainant \u2013\r\nKaptan Singh for all practical purposes is ranked outsider and stranger to the deal and therefore the\r\ncriminal proceedings initiated at his behest cannot continue; that no power of attorney executed by\r\nMunni Devi in his favour has been filed with the counter affidavit and on the ground that the dispute\r\nis of a civil nature and civil suits are pending between the parties and veracity and genuineness of\r\nthe notarized affidavit signed by Munni Devi and Mamta Gupta can be considered in the civil\r\nproceedings and there was no entrustment of property and therefore no case is made out for the\r\noffence under Section 406 of the IPC. That having observed that there is no case against the accusedunder Section 406 IPC, the High Court has further observed that rest of the allegations are tangent\r\nto the main allegation without any corroborating evidence.\r\n5. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High\r\nCourt, quashing the entire criminal proceedings in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482\r\nCr.P.C., the original complainant has preferred the present appeal.\r\n6. Shri Santosh Kumar Pandey, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has\r\nvehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has committed\r\na grave error in quashing the criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\r\nIt is further submitted that the High Court ought to have appreciated and considered the fact that\r\nafter the FIR was lodged, the same came to be investigated by the Investigating Officer and after\r\nthorough investigation and recording the statement of the witnesses and after collecting the\r\nevidence and even after recording the statements of the independent witnesses and statement of the\r\naccused persons and after holding inquiry the Investigating Officer filed the charge-sheet against the\r\naccused persons and even thereafter the Learned Magistrate also took the cognizance. It is\r\nsubmitted that the aforesaid aspect has not been considered at all by the High Court while quashing\r\nthe criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\r\n6.1 It is further submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate and consider that there are\r\ncontentious issues which can be considered only at the time of trial.\r\n6.2 It is further submitted that the High Court has entered into the merits of the allegations at the\r\nstage of quashing proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. It is submitted that as held by this Court in\r\ncatena of decisions while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the High Court is not\r\nrequired to enter into and\/or consider the merits of the allegations in detail, which as such are\r\nrequired to be considered at the time of trial. Heavy reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court\r\nin Dineshbhai Chandubhai Patel vs. State of Gujarat, (2018) 3 SCC 104; Dhruvaram Murlidhar\r\nSonar vs. State of Maharashtra, (2019) 18 SCC 191; CBI vs. Arvind Khanna, (2019) 10 SCC 686;\r\nTelangana vs. Managipet, (2019) 19 SCC 87; XYZ vs. State of Gujarat, (2019) 10 SCC 337.\r\n6.3 It is submitted that as held by this Court in the case of XYZ (Supra) when there are serious\r\ntriable allegations in complaint it is improper to quash the FIR in exercise of inherent powers of\r\nHigh Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\r\n6.4 It is further submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate and consider that the civil\r\nproceedings were initiated initially by Munni Devi and thereafter the accused no.2 filed the suit only\r\nfor permanent injunction and no suit for specific performance has been filed. It is submitted that as\r\nsuch there are very serious allegations of forgery of the joint notarized document dated 27.10.2010\r\nby which the accused have alleged to have given Rs.25 lakhs to Munni Devi. It is submitted that the\r\nHigh Court has failed to appreciate and consider the fact that in the present case there are two\r\ndocuments of the very date i.e. 27.10.2010, one is registered one in which the sale consideration is\r\nstated to be Rs.25 lakhs and in another document of same date dated 27.10.2010, the sale\r\nconsideration is stated to be Rs.35 lakhs and it is stated that Rs.25 lakhs have been paid to MunniDevi. It is submitted that the payment of Rs.25 lakhs and even the existence of joint notarized\r\nagreement dated 27.10.2010 is to be considered at the time of trial. It is submitted that therefore,\r\nwhen there are serious triable issues, the High Court is not justified in quashing the criminal\r\nproceedings.\r\n7. Shri Ankit Goel, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of State of Uttar Pradesh has supported the\r\nappellant - original complainant.\r\n8. Shri Amit Kumar Singh, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the private respondents while\r\nopposing the present appeal has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the\r\ncase the High Court has not committed any error in quashing the criminal proceedings.\r\n8.1 It is submitted that as rightly observed by the High Court, the case squarely falls within the\r\nexceptions as observed and held by this Court in the case of State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992\r\nSupp (1) SCC 335. 8.2 It is submitted that in the present case there was no entrustment of any\r\nproperty and therefore, there is no question of any offence being committed under Section 406 IPC.\r\nIt is submitted that therefore when the ingredients for the offence under Section 406 IPC are not\r\nsatisfied and as rightly observed by the High Court the genuineness of the documents dated\r\n27.10.2010 are to be considered in the civil proceedings and which are not required to be considered\r\nin the criminal proceedings, the High Court is absolutely justified in quashing the criminal\r\nproceedings. It is submitted that as such the civil dispute is tried to be converted into criminal\r\ndispute which can be said to be nothing but an abuse of process of law.\r\n8.3 It is further submitted by learned Counsel appearing on behalf of private respondents that even\r\nin the present case medical certificate which is now produced before this Court, was not produced\r\nbefore the High Court. It is submitted therefore in absence of any medical report produced before\r\nthe High Court and even otherwise the injuries mentioned in the medical report are simple in\r\nnature, no case is made out for the other offences and therefore the High Court has rightly quashed\r\nthe criminal proceedings.\r\n8.4 It is further submitted that as observed by the High Court even the original complainant has no\r\nlocus to file the complaint as no power of attorney alleged to have been executed by Munni Devi was\r\nplaced on record.\r\n8.5 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the appeal. 9 Heard learned Counsel for\r\nthe respective parties at length. 9.1 At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the present case\r\nthe High Court in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has quashed the criminal\r\nproceedings for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149, 406, 329 and 386 of IPC. It is required to\r\nbe noted that when the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. quashed the\r\ncriminal proceedings, by the time the Investigating Officer after recording the statement of the\r\nwitnesses, statement of the complainant and collecting the evidence from the incident place and\r\nafter taking statement of the independent witnesses and even statement of the accused persons, has\r\nfiled the charge-sheet before the Learned Magistrate for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149,\r\n406, 329 and 386 of IPC and even the learned Magistrate also took the cognizance. From theimpugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it does not appear that the High Court\r\ntook into consideration the material collected during the investigation\/inquiry and even the\r\nstatements recorded. If the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was at the stage of FIR in that case\r\nthe allegations in the FIR\/Complaint only are required to be considered and whether a cognizable\r\noffence is disclosed or not is required to be considered. However, thereafter when the statements are\r\nrecorded, evidence is collected and the charge-sheet is filed after conclusion of the\r\ninvestigation\/inquiry the matter stands on different footing and the Court is required to consider\r\nthe material\/evidence collected during the investigation. Even at this stage also, as observed and\r\nheld by this Court in catena of decisions, the High Court is not required to go into the merits of the\r\nallegations and\/or enter into the merits of the case as if the High Court is exercising the appellate\r\njurisdiction and\/or conducting the trial. As held by this Court in the case of Dineshbhai Chandubhai\r\nPatel (Supra) in order to examine as to whether factual contents of FIR disclose any cognizable\r\noffence or not, the High Court cannot act like the Investigating agency nor can exercise the powers\r\nlike an Appellate Court. It is further observed and held that question is required to be examined\r\nkeeping in view, the contents of FIR and prima facie material, if any, requiring no proof. At such\r\nstage, the High Court cannot appreciate evidence nor can it draw its own inferences from contents of\r\nFIR and material relied on. It is further observed it is more so, when the material relied on is\r\ndisputed. It is further observed that in such a situation, it becomes the job of the Investigating\r\nAuthority at such stage to probe and then of the Court to examine questions once the charge-sheet is\r\nfiled along with such material as to how far and to what extent reliance can be placed on such\r\nmaterial.\r\n9.2 In the case of Dhruvaram Murlidhar Sonar (Supra) after considering the decisions of this Court\r\nin Bhajan Lal (Supra), it is held by this Court that exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to\r\nquash the proceedings is an exception and not a rule. It is further observed that inherent jurisdiction\r\nunder Section 482 Cr.P.C. though wide is to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution, only\r\nwhen such exercise is justified by tests specifically laid down in section itself. It is further observed\r\nthat appreciation of evidence is not permissible at the stage of quashing of proceedings in exercise of\r\npowers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Similar view has been expressed by this Court in the case of\r\nArvind Khanna (Supra), Managipet (Supra) and in the case of XYZ (Supra), referred to hereinabove.\r\n9.3 Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on\r\nhand, we are of the opinion that the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the\r\ncriminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\r\n10 The High Court has failed to appreciate and consider the fact that there are very serious triable\r\nissues\/allegations which are required to be gone into and considered at the time of trial. The High\r\nCourt has lost sight of crucial aspects which have emerged during the course of the investigation.\r\nThe High Court has failed to appreciate and consider the fact that the document i.e. a joint notarized\r\naffidavit of Mamta Gupta \u2013 Accused No.2 and Munni Devi under which according to Accused no.2 -\r\nMs. Mamta Gupta, Rs.25 lakhs was paid and the possession was transferred to her itself is seriously\r\ndisputed. It is required to be noted that in the registered agreement to sell dated 27.10.2010, the sale\r\nconsideration is stated to be Rs.25 lakhs and with no reference to payment of Rs.25 lakhs to Ms.\r\nMunni Devi and no reference to handing over the possession. However, in the joint notarizedaffidavit of the same date i.e., 27.10.2010 sale consideration is stated to be Rs.35 lakhs out of which\r\nRs.25 lakhs is alleged to have been paid and there is a reference to transfer of possession to Accused\r\nNo.2. Whether Rs.25 lakhs has been paid or not the accused have to establish during the trial,\r\nbecause the accused are relying upon the said document and payment of Rs.25 lakhs as mentioned\r\nin the joint notarized affidavit dated 27.10.2010. It is also required to be considered that the first\r\nagreement to sell in which Rs.25 lakhs is stated to be sale consideration and there is reference to the\r\npayment of Rs.10 lakhs by cheques. It is a registered document. The aforesaid are all triable\r\nissues\/allegations which are required to be considered at the time of trial. The High Court has failed\r\nto notice and\/or consider the material collected during the investigation.\r\n11. Now so far as the finding recorded by the High Court that no case is made out for the offence\r\nunder Section 406 IPC is concerned, it is to be noted that the High Court itself has noted that the\r\njoint notarized affidavit dated 27.10.2010 is seriously disputed, however as per the High Court the\r\nsame is required to be considered in the civil proceedings. There the High Court has committed an\r\nerror. Even the High Court has failed to notice that another FIR has been lodged against the accused\r\nfor the offences under Sections 467, 468, 471 IPC with respect to the said alleged joint notarized\r\naffidavit. Even according to the accused the possession was handed over to them. However, when\r\nthe payment of Rs.25 lakhs as mentioned in the joint notarized affidavit is seriously disputed and\r\neven one of the cheques out of 5 cheques each of Rs.2 lakhs was dishonoured and according to the\r\naccused they were handed over the possession (which is seriously disputed) it can be said to be\r\nentrustment of property. Therefore, at this stage to opine that no case is made out for the offence\r\nunder Section 406 IPC is premature and the aforesaid aspect is to be considered during trial. It is\r\nalso required to be noted that the first suit was filed by Munni Devi and thereafter subsequent suit\r\ncame to be filed by the accused and that too for permanent injunction only. Nothing is on record\r\nthat any suit for specific performance has been filed. Be that as it may, all the aforesaid aspects are\r\nrequired to be considered at the time of trial only. Therefore, the High Court has grossly erred in\r\nquashing the criminal proceedings by entering into the merits of the allegations as if the High Court\r\nwas exercising the appellate jurisdiction and\/or conducting the trial. The High Court has exceeded\r\nits jurisdiction in quashing the criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\r\n12. Even the High Court has erred in observing that original complaint has no locus. The aforesaid\r\nobservation is made on the premise that the complainant has not placed on record the power of\r\nattorney along with the counter filed before the High Court. However, when it is specifically stated\r\nin the FIR that Munni Devi has executed the power of attorney and thereafter the Investigating\r\nOfficer has conducted the investigation and has recorded the statement of the complainant, accused\r\nand the independent witnesses, thereafter whether the complainant is having the power of attorney\r\nor not is to be considered during trial.\r\n13. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and order passed\r\nby the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482\r\nCr.P.C. is unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly\r\nquashed and set aside. Now, the trial to be conducted and proceeded further in accordance with law\r\nand on its own merits. It is made clear that the observations made by this Court in the present\r\nproceedings are to be treated to be confined to the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. only andthe trial Court to decide the case in accordance with law and on its own merits and on the basis of\r\nthe evidence to be laid and without being influenced by any of the observations made by us\r\nhereinabove. The present appeal is accordingly allowed.\r\n.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J. [Dr. Dhananjaya Y.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 11.03.2019\r\npassed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Regular First Appeal (RFA) No.1674 of 2013,\r\nby which the High Court has allowed the said appeal preferred by respondent No.1 herein \u2013\r\nemployee and has quashed and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court\r\nconsequently dismissing the suit filed by respondent No.1 herein \u2013 original plaintiff declaring the\r\ndate of birth of employee 24.01.1961, the original defendant \u2013 Karnataka Rural Infrastructure\r\nDevelopment Limited (hereinafter referred to as the original defendant \u2013 appellant \u2212corporation)\r\nhas preferred the present appeal.\r\n2. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 05.11.2019passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad in Writ Petition No.109447 of 2019 (S\u2212RES), by\r\nwhich the High Court has partly allowed the said writ petition, relying upon the judgment and order\r\npassed in RFA No.1674 of 2013 (which is the subject matter of Civil Appeal No.5720 of 2021 arising\r\nout of SLP No.2368 of 2020) and has directed the Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development\r\nLimited to reconsider the decision of original writ petitioner with respect to change of date of birth,\r\nthe original respondent \u2212 Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited has preferred Civil\r\nAppeal No.5721 of 2021 arising out of SLP No.1062 of 2021.\r\n3. The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:\u2212 3.1 That respondent No.1 herein\r\n\u2013 original plaintiff was appointed with the appellant \u2212 corporation in the year 1984. In the service\r\nrecord his date of birth was reflected as 04.01.1960 as per SSLC Marks Card. After the lapse of\r\nnearly 24 years, respondent no.1 herein \u2013 original plaintiff requested for change of date of birth\r\nfrom 04.01.1960 to 24.01.1961. That thereafter respondent No.1 filed a suit for declaration before\r\nAdditional City Civil and Sessions Judge at Bengalore to declare that his date of birth is 24.01.1961.\r\nThe suit was opposed by the appellant \u2013 corporation relying upon the Karnataka State Servants\r\n(Determination of Age) Act, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 1974) and resolution dated\r\n17.05.1991 passed by the appellant \u2212 corporation adopting the Karnataka Civil Service Rules and\r\nallied laws. The said rule provided that the request for change of date of birth in the service record\r\nshall be made within a period of three years from the date of joining or within one year from\r\ncommencement of the Karnataka Act No.22 of 1974. The suit was also opposed on the ground of\r\ndelay and laches on the part of respondent No.1 \u2013 original plaintiff in requesting to change the date\r\nof birth. Relying upon Section 5(2) of the Act, 1974 the learned Trial Court dismissed the suit vide\r\njudgment and decree dated 28.07.2013.\r\n3.2 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial\r\nCourt dismissing the suit, respondent No.1 \u2013 original plaintiff preferred Regular First Appeal\r\nNo.1674 of 2013 before the High Court. The High Court by the impugned judgment and order dated\r\n11.03.2019 has allowed the said appeal by observing that it was highly impossible that the plaintiff\r\nshould have availed the remedy within three years from the date of joining of service and also\r\nobserving that the resolution dated 17.05.1991 passed by the appellant \u2212 corporation adopting the\r\nKarnataka Civil Service Rules and allied laws was not brought to notice of the plaintiff.\r\n3.3 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High\r\nCourt dated 11.03.2019 allowing the said appeal and quashing and setting aside the judgment and\r\ndecree passed by the learned Trial Court dismissing the suit preferred by respondent No.1 herein\r\nand consequently decreeing the suit and declaring the date of birth of respondent No.1 \u2013 original\r\nplaintiff 24.01.1961 instead of 04.01.1960 recorded in the service record, original defendant \u2013\r\nemployer \u2013 corporation has preferred the present appeal.\r\n4. Shri Gurudas S. Kannur, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant \u2013\r\ncorporation has vehemently submitted in the facts and circumstances of the case more particularly\r\nwhen the request for change of date of birth was made after 24 years and dehors the statutory\r\nprovisions, the High Court committed a grave error in decreeing the suit and granting the\r\ndeclaratory relief. It is submitted that as mandated by Section 5 (2) of the Act, 1974 no suchalteration to the date of birth to the advantage of a State servant be made unless the employee has\r\nmade an application for the purpose within three years from the date on which his age and date of\r\nbirth is accepted and recorded in the service register or book or any other record of service or within\r\none year from the date of commencement of the Act, 1974, whichever is later. It is submitted that the\r\nAct, 1974 came to be adopted by the appellant \u2013 corporation in the year 1991 and therefore\r\nrespondent No.1 \u2013 original plaintiff ought to have made the request for change of date of birth at\r\nleast within one year from 17.05.1991 i.e. when the resolution was passed by the appellant \u2013\r\ncorporation adopting the Act, 1974 and allied laws. It is submitted that in the present case\r\nrespondent No.1 \u2212 employee made the application for the first time vide notice dated 23.06.2007 i.e.\r\nafter the lapse of 24 years since he joined the service and nearly after the lapse of 16 years from the\r\ndate of adoption of enactment (Act, 1974) by the appellant \u2013 corporation.\r\n4.1 It is submitted that the High Court ought to have appreciated that the ignorance of law cannot be\r\nan excuse. It is submitted that being an employee in fact he was supposed to know the rules and\r\nregulations applicable to the employees of the corporation.\r\n4.2 It is submitted that in any case, the High Court ought to have non suited the employee on the\r\nground of delay and laches as the request for change of date of birth was made after lapse of 16 years\r\nfrom the date of adoption of enactment (Act, 1974) by appellant \u2013 corporation.\r\n4.3 Relying upon the decisions of this court in the cases of Home Deptt. v. R.Kirubakaran, 1994\r\nSupp (1) SCC 155; State of M.P. v. Premlal Shrivas, (2011) 9 SCC 664; Life Insurance Corporation of\r\nIndia & Others v. R.Basavaraju (2016) 15 SCC 781 and Bharat Coking Coal Limited and Ors. v.\r\nShyam Kishore Singh (2020) 3 SCC 411, it is prayed to allow the present appeal.\r\n4.4 Learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant \u2013 corporation had fairly admitted that so\r\nfar as respondent No.1 herein \u2212 employee is concerned, the impugned judgment and order passed\r\nby the High Court has been implemented. However, as others suits are pending, he has requested to\r\ndecide the question of law so that the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court may\r\nnot come in the way of corporation.\r\n5. Shri Ashok Bannidinni, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 \u2013 original\r\nplaintiff has submitted that so far as respondent No.1 \u2013original plaintiff is concerned the impugned\r\njudgment and order passed by the High Court has been implemented in the year 2019 and even\r\nthereafter he has attained the age of superannuation treating and considering his date of birth as\r\n24.01.1961, nothing further is required to be done in the present appeal and as such the present\r\nappeal has become infructuous so far as respondent No.1 \u2013 original plaintiff is concerned.\r\n5.1 Now so far as Civil Appeal No.5721 of 2021 arising out of SLP No.1062 of 2020 is concerned, it is\r\nsubmitted that even the said appeal has also become infructuous as after the impugned judgment\r\nand order dated 05.11.2019 passed by the High Court in writ petition No.109447 of 2019, by which\r\nthe High Court has directed the appellant \u2013 corporation to re\u2212 consider the request of the writ\r\npetitioner \u2013 respondent herein for change of date of birth in light of the judgment and order passed\r\nin RFA No.1670 of 2013, thereafter the appellant \u2013 corporation reconsidered the\r\napplication\/representation of the writ petitioner \u2013 respondent herein and his prayer for change of\r\ndate of birth came to be rejected against which even the writ petition was preferred before the\r\nlearned Single Judge and the same has also been dismissed. It is submitted that therefore even Civil\r\nAppeal No. 5721 of 2021 arising out of SLP No.1062 of 2020 has become infructuous.\r\n5.2 Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of appellant \u2212corporation is not disputing the\r\naforesaid factual matrix.\r\n6. Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant \u2013 corporation and respondent\r\nNo.1 \u2212 employee.\r\n7. The dispute is with respect to change of date of birth in the service record. The employees of the\r\nState Government for the determination of the age are governed by the Karnataka State Servant\r\n(Determination of Age) Act, 1974; Section 4 of the Act, 1974 provides for bar of alteration of age\r\nexcept under the Act, 1974; Section 5 of the Act, 1974 provides alteration of age or date of birth of\r\nState servants which provides that subject to Sub\u2212section (2), the State Government may, at any\r\ntime, after an inquiry, alter the age and date of birth of a State servant as recorded or deemed to\r\nhave been recorded in his service register or book or any other record of service. Sub\u2212section (2) of\r\nSection 5 further provides that no such alteration to the advantage of a State servant shall be made,\r\nunless he has made an application for the purpose within three years from the date on which his age\r\nand date of birth is accepted and recorded in the service register or book or any other record of\r\nservice or within one year from the date of commencement of Act, 1974, whichever is later. Section 6\r\nof the Act, 1974 further provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to settle, decide or deal with\r\nany question which is required to be decided under the Act, 1974. It also further provides that no\r\ndecision under Act, 1974 shall be questioned in any court of law. Section 4, Section 5 and Section 6\r\nwhich are relevant for our purpose are re\u2212produced herein below: \u2212\r\n4. Bar of alteration of age except under the Act.\u2212 Notwithstanding anything contained in any law or\r\nany judgment, decree or order of any court or other authority, no alteration of the age or date of\r\nbirth of a State servant as accepted and recorded or deemed to have been accepted and recorded in\r\nhis service register or book or any other record of service under section 3 shall, in so far as it relates\r\nto his conditions of service as such State servant, be made except under section 5.\r\n5. Alteration of age or date of birth of State servants.\u2212 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the State\r\nGovernment may, at any time, after an inquiry, alter the age and date of birth of a State servant as\r\nrecorded or deemed to have been recorded in his service register or book or any other record of\r\nservice:\r\nProvided that no such alteration shall be made if the age and date of birth of a State\r\nservant has been accepted and recorded or deemed to have been accepted and\r\nrecorded in the service register or book or any other record of service in pursuance of\r\na decree of a civil court obtained by the State servant 1 [after he became such\r\nservant]1 against the State Government:\r\n1. Inserted by Act 22 of 1977 w.e.f. 29.7.1977 Provided further that no such alteration\r\nshall be made without giving the State servant concerned a reasonable opportunity of\r\nbeing heard.\r\n(2) No such alteration to the advantage of a State servant shall be made unless he has made an\r\napplication for the purpose within three years from the date on which his age and date of birth is\r\naccepted and recorded in the service register or book or any other record of service or within one\r\nyear from the date of commencement of this Act, whichever is later.\r\n6. Bar of jurisdiction of courts.\u2212 (1) No court shall have jurisdiction to settle, decide or deal with any\r\nquestion which is required to be decided under this Act. (2) No decision under this Act shall be\r\nquestioned in any court of law.\r\n8. So far as the appellant corporation is concerned, they adopted the provisions of the Act, 1974 by\r\nresolution dated 17.05.1991. Therefore, as such the request for change of date of birth as per the Act,\r\n1974 as adopted by the appellant \u2013 corporation in the year 1991 was required to be made by\r\nrespondent No.1 \u2013 employee within a period of one year from 17.05.1991 being the employee of the\r\nappellant \u2212 corporation. However, respondent No.1 \u2013 employee made the request for change of date\r\nof birth vide notice dated 23.06.2007 i.e. after the lapse of 24 years since he joined the service and\r\nnearly after the lapse of 16 years from the date of adoption of enactment (Act, 1974) by the appellant\r\n\u2013 corporation. The High Court in the impugned judgment and order has observed that nothing is on\r\nrecord that resolution dated 17.05.1991 adopting the Act, 1974 was brought to the notice of the\r\nemployee and that therefore respondent No.1 \u2013 employee might not be aware of the applicability of\r\nthe Act, 1974. Aforesaid cannot be accepted. Being the employee of the corporation, he was\r\nsupposed to know the rules and regulations applicable to the employees of the corporation.\r\nIgnorance of law cannot be an excuse to get out of the applicability of the statutory provisions.\r\n9. Even otherwise and assuming that the reasoning given by the High Court for the sake of\r\nconvenience is accepted in that case also even respondent No.1 \u2013 employee was not entitled to any\r\nrelief or change of date of birth on the ground of delay and laches as the request for change of date of\r\nbirth was made after lapse of 24 years since he joined the service. At this stage, few decisions of this\r\ncourt on the issue of correction of the date of birth are required to be referred to. 9.1 In the case of\r\nHome Deptt. v. R.Kirubakaran (Supra), it is observed and held as under:\u2212 \u201C7. An application for\r\ncorrection of the date of birth should not be dealt with by the Tribunal or the High Court keeping in\r\nview only the public servant concerned. It need not be pointed out that any such direction for\r\ncorrection of the date of birth of the public servant concerned has a chain reaction, inasmuch as\r\nothers waiting for years, below him for their respective promotions are affected in this process.\r\nSome are likely to suffer irreparable injury, inasmuch as, because of the correction of the date of\r\nbirth, the officer concerned, continues in office, in some cases for years, within which time many\r\nofficers who are below him in seniority waiting for their promotion, may lose the promotion for\r\never\u2026\u201D 9.2 In the case of State of M.P. v. Premlal Shrivas, (Supra) in paragraph 8 and 12, it is\r\nobserved and held as under:\u2212 \u201C8. It needs to be emphasised that in matters involving correction of\r\ndate of birth of a government servant, particularly on the eve of his superannuation or at the fag end\r\nof his career, the court or the tribunal has to be circumspect, cautious and careful while issuingdirection for correction of date of birth, recorded in the service book at the time of entry into any\r\ngovernment service. Unless the court or the tribunal is fully satisfied on the basis of the irrefutable\r\nproof relating to his date of birth and that such a claim is made in accordance with the procedure\r\nprescribed or as per the consistent procedure adopted by the department concerned, as the case may\r\nbe, and a real injustice has been caused to the person concerned, the court or the tribunal should be\r\nloath to issue a direction for correction of the service book. Time and again this Court has expressed\r\nthe view that if a government servant makes a request for correction of the recorded date of birth\r\nafter lapse of a long time of his induction into the service, particularly beyond the time fixed by his\r\nemployer, he cannot claim, as a matter of right, the correction of his date of birth, even if he has\r\ngood evidence to establish that the recorded date of birth is clearly erroneous. No court or the\r\ntribunal can come to the aid of those who sleep over their rights (see Union of India v. Harnam\r\nSingh [(1993) 2 SCC 162 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 375 : (1993) 24 ATC 92] ).\r\n12. Be that as it may, in our opinion, the delay of over two decades in applying for the correction of\r\ndate of birth is ex facie fatal to the case of the respondent, notwithstanding the fact that there was no\r\nspecific rule or order, framed or made, prescribing the period within which such application could\r\nbe filed. It is trite that even in such a situation such an application should be filed which can be held\r\nto be reasonable. The application filed by the respondent 25 years after his induction into service, by\r\nno standards, can be held to be reasonable, more so when not a feeble attempt was made to explain\r\nthe said delay. There is also no substance in the plea of the respondent that since Rule 84 of the M.P.\r\nFinancial Code does not prescribe the time\u2212limit within which an application is to be filed, the\r\nappellants were duty\u2212bound to correct the clerical error in recording of his date of birth in the\r\nservice book.\u201D 9.3 In the case of Life Insurance Corporation of India & Others v. R.Basavaraju\r\n(Supra), it is observed as under:\u2212 \u201C5. The law with regard to correction of date of birth has been time\r\nand again discussed by this Court and held that once the date of birth is entered in the service\r\nrecord, as per the educational certificates and accepted by the employee, the same cannot be\r\nchanged. Not only that, this Court has also held that a claim for change in date of birth cannot be\r\nentertained at the fag end of retirement\u201D 9.4 In the case of Bharat Coking Coal Limited and Ors. v.\r\nShyam Kishore Singh (Supra) of which one of us (Justice A.S. Bopanna) was a party to the bench has\r\nobserved and held in paragraph 9 & 10 as under:\u2212 \u201C9. This Court has consistently held that the\r\nrequest for change of the date of birth in the service records at the fag end of service is not\r\nsustainable. The learned Additional Solicitor General has in that regard relied on the decision in the\r\ncase of State of Maharashtra and Anr. v. Gorakhnath Sitaram Kamble (2010)14 SCC 423 wherein a\r\nseries of the earlier decisions of this Court were taken note and was held as hereunder:\r\n\u201C16. The learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the judgment of this\r\nCourt in U.P. Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad v. Raj Kumar Agnihotri [(2005) 11\r\nSCC465: 2006 SCC (L&S) 96]. In this case, this Court has considered a number of\r\njudgments of this Court and observed that the grievance as to the date of birth in the\r\nservice record should not be permitted at the fag end of the service career.\r\n17. In another judgment in State of Uttaranchal v.Pitamber Dutt Semwal [(2005) 11 SCC 477 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 106] relief was denied to the\r\ngovernment employee on the ground that he sought correction in the service record after nearly 30\r\nyears of service. While setting aside the judgment of the High Court, this Court observed that the\r\nHigh Court ought not to have interfered with the decision after almost three decades.\r\n19. These decisions lead to a different dimension of the case that correction at the fag end would be\r\nat the cost of a large number of employees, therefore, any correction at the fag end must be\r\ndiscouraged by the court. The relevant portion of the judgment in Home Deptt.v. R. Kirubakaran\r\n[1994 Supp (1) SCC 155 :\r\n1994 SCC (L&S) 449 : (1994) 26 ATC 828] reads as under: (SCC pp. 158 59, para 7)\r\n\u201C7. An application for correction of the date of birth [by a public servant cannot be\r\nentertained at the fag end of his service]. It need not be pointed out that any such\r\ndirection for correction of the date of birth of the public servant concerned has a\r\nchain reaction, inasmuch as others waiting for years, below him for their respective\r\npromotions are affected in this process. Some are likely to suffer irreparable injury,\r\ninasmuch as, because of the correction of the date of birth, the officer concerned,\r\ncontinues in office, in some cases for years, within which time many officers who are\r\nbelow him in seniority waiting for their promotion, may lose their promotion forever.\r\n\u2026 According to us, this is an important aspect, which cannot be lost sight of by the\r\ncourt or the tribunal while examining the grievance of a public servant in respect of\r\ncorrection of his date of birth. As such, unless a clear case on the basis of materials\r\nwhich can be held to be conclusive in nature, is made out by the respondent, the court\r\nor the tribunal should not issue a direction, on the basis of materials which make\r\nsuch claim only plausible. Before any such direction is issued, the court or the\r\ntribunal must be fully satisfied that there has been real injustice to the person\r\nconcerned and his claim for correction of date of birth has been made in accordance\r\nwith the procedure prescribed, and within the time fixed by any rule or order. \u2026 the\r\nonus is on the applicant to prove the wrong recording of his date of birth, in his\r\nservice book.\u201D \u201C10. This Court in fact has also held that even if there is good evidence\r\nto establish that the recorded date of birth is erroneous, the correction cannot be\r\nclaimed as a matter of right. In that regard, in State of M.P. vs. Premlal Shrivas,\r\n(Supra) it is held as hereunder:\u2212 \u201C8. It needs to be emphasised that in matters\r\ninvolving correction of date of birth of a government servant, particularly on the eve\r\nof his superannuation or at the fag end of his career, the court or the tribunal has to\r\nbe circumspect, cautious and careful while issuing direction for correction of date of\r\nbirth, recorded in the service book at the time of entry into any government service.\r\nUnless the court or the tribunal is fully satisfied on the basis of the irrefutable proof\r\nrelating to his date of birth and that such a claim is made in accordance with the\r\nprocedure prescribed or as per the consistent procedure adopted by the department\r\nconcerned, as the case may be, and a real injustice has been caused to the person\r\nconcerned, the court or the tribunal should be loath to issue a direction for correction\r\nof the service book. Time and again this Court has expressed the view that if a\r\ngovernment servant makes a request for correction of the recorded date of birth after\r\nlapse of a long time of his induction into the service, particularly beyond the time\r\nfixed by his employer, he cannot claim, as a matter of right, the correction of his date\r\nof birth, even if he has good evidence to establish that the recorded date of birth is\r\nclearly erroneous. No court or the tribunal can come to the aid of those who sleepover\r\ntheir rights\u201D (see Union of India v. Harnam Singh [(1993) 2 SCC 162 : 1993 SCC\r\n(L&S) 375 : (1993) 24 ATC 92] ).\r\n12. Be that as it may, in our opinion, the delay of over two decades in applying for the\r\ncorrection of date of birth is ex facie fatal to the case of the respondent,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that there was no specific rule or order, framed or made,\r\nprescribing the period within which such application could be filed. It is trite that\r\neven in such a situation such an application should be filed which can be held to be\r\nreasonable. The application filed by the respondent 25 years after his induction into\r\nservice, by no standards, can be held to be reasonable, more so when not a feeble\r\nattempt was made to explain the said delay. There is also no substance in the plea of\r\nthe respondent that since Rule 84 of the M.P. Financial Code does not prescribe the\r\ntime\u2212limit within which an application is to be filed, the appellants were duty\u2212bound\r\nto correct the clerical error in recording of his date of birth in the service book.\u201D\r\n10. Considering the aforesaid decisions of this Court the law on change of date of\r\nbirth can be summarized as under:\r\n(i) application for change of date of birth can only be as per the relevant\r\nprovisions\/regulations applicable;\r\n(ii) even if there is cogent evidence, the same cannot be claimed as a matter of right;\r\n(iii) application can be rejected on the ground of delay and latches also more\r\nparticularly when it is made at the fag end of service and\/or when the employee is\r\nabout to retire on attaining the age of superannuation.\r\n11. Therefore, applying the law laid down by this court in the aforesaid decisions, the application of\r\nthe respondent for change of date of birth was liable to be rejected on the ground of delay and laches\r\nalso and therefore as such respondent employee was not entitled to the decree of declaration and\r\ntherefore the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is unsustainable and not\r\ntenable at law.\r\n12. However, considering the fact that when the impugned judgment and order passed by the High\r\nCourt has been implemented and respondent No.1 has retired thereafter considering his date of\r\nbirth as 24.01.1961, it is observed that the present judgment and order shall not affect respondent\r\nNo.1 \u2013 employee and we decide the question of law in terms of the above in favour of the appellant \u2013\r\ncorporation. With this Civil Appeal No. 5720 of 2021 stands disposed of.13. So far as the Civil Appeal No.5721 of 2021 arising out of the SLP No.1062 of 2020 is concerned, it\r\nis true that while passing the impugned judgment and order the High Court heavily relied upon the\r\njudgment in RFA No.1674 of 2013 (subject matter of Civil No.5720 of 2021) which also is not\r\nsustainable in law as observed hereinabove. However considering the fact that thereafter after the\r\nimpugned judgment and order dated 05.11.2019 passed by the High Court in W.P. No.109447 of\r\n2019 directing the appellant \u2013 corporation to consider the case of the original writ petitioner \u2013\r\nrespondent herein in light of the decision in the case of RFA No.1674 of 2013, the case of the\r\nrespondent came to be reconsidered and his prayer for change of date of birth came to be rejected\r\non the ground of delay and laches and even thereafter also the fresh decision was challenged before\r\nthe learned Single Judge and the learned Single Judge has also dismissed the subsequent writ\r\npetition. Therefore, no further order is required to be passed in the present appeal and is\r\naccordingly disposed of. However, question of law is decided in favour of the appellant \u2013\r\ncorporation as observed hereinabove.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J. (M.

The Court then took cognizanceon 17.12.2018.\r\n6. It is only after the cognizance was taken by the competent Court, the private\r\nrespondent\u2212Mohan Nayak.N was advised to file Writ Petition No.9717 of 2019 before\r\nthe High Court on 25.02.2019, for the following reliefs:\r\n\u201CPRAYER WHEREFORE, the Petitioner above named most respectfully prays that\r\nthis Hon\u2019ble Court may be pleased to;\r\n(a) Issue a writ in the nature of certiorari or any other writ or order or direction,\r\nquashing the order dated: 14.08.2018 passed by the third Respondent herein in\r\nNo.CRM(1) KCOCA\/01\/2018 thereby passing an order of approval under section\r\n24(1)(a) of the Karnataka Control of Organised Crimes Act, 2000 (herein after\r\nreferred to as KCOCA Act for short) to invoke the section 3 of the said Act in Crime\r\nNo.221\/2017 registered by the fifth Respondent herein for the offences punishable\r\nunder section 302, 120B, 118, 114 read with section 35 of the Indian Penal Code and\r\nsections 3 and 25 of the Indian Arms Act and also the additional charge sheet filed by\r\nthe fourth Respondent herein against the Petitioner in so far as section 3(i), 3(ii),\r\n3(iii) and 3(iv) of the KCOCA Act, which are produced as ANNEXURES\u2212A & B\r\nrespectively; and\r\n(b) Grant such other and further reliefs as deems fit in the circumstances of the case\r\nin the interest of justice and equity.\u201D\r\n7. The High Court vide impugned judgment noted that it was called upon to examine\r\nwhether the impugned order dated 14.08.2018 issued by the Commissioner of Police,\r\nBengaluru City in exercise of power under Section 24(1)(a) of the 2000 Act according\r\nprior approval to invoke Section 3 of the 2000 Act for investigation against\r\nconcerned accused including writ petitioner\u2212 Mohan Nayak.N is legal and valid. In\r\nthe context of that relief, the High Court noted the submissions made by the counsel\r\nfor the writ petitioner in the following words:\r\n\u201C7. Sri Gautham S. Bharadwaj, learned Counsel for the petitioner challenges the order\r\nAnnexure\u2212A granting permission under Section 24(1)(a) of the Act against the\r\npetition on the following grounds:\r\n(i) The petitioner was not involved in continuing unlawful activity as contemplated in\r\nSection 2(1)(d) of the Act;\r\n(ii) The charge sheet allegations do not attract organized crime as contemplated\r\nunder Section 2(e) of the Act; &\r\n(iii) By such unlawful invocation of Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, personal liberty of the\r\npetitioner is violated, thereby the order Annexure\u2212A is violative of Article 21 of theConstitution of India, 1950.\u201D\r\n8. The High Court also adverted to the three decisions pressed into service by the writ\r\npetitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N, namely, State of Maharashtra & Ors. vs. Lalit Somdatta\r\nNagpal & Anr.5, State (NCT of Delhi) vs. Brijesh Singh @ Arun Kumar & Anr. 6 and\r\nMuniraju R. vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.7.\r\n9. The High Court then proceeded to note the objections taken by the prosecution in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\u201C9. Sri H.S. Chandramouli, learned Special Public Prosecutor opposes the petition on\r\nthe following grounds:\r\n(i) There is no dispute that accused Nos.7 and 10 were involved in two criminal cases\r\neach, accused Nos.9, 1 to 4 were involved in one criminal case each.\r\nThe said offences were cognizable offences and the cognizance was taken in those cases;\r\n(ii) If one of the members of the organized crime syndicate is involved in more than one case and the\r\ncharge sheet was filed, Section 2(d) of the Act is attracted. Therefore even if the petitioner was not\r\ninvolved in other cases, respondent No.3 has rightly invoked Section 2(d) of the Act;\r\n(iii) Annexure\u2212A shows that the approval was granted for investigation on due application of mind;\r\n(iv) After the charge sheet was filed, the trial Court has taken cognizance of the offences and the\r\npetitioner has not sought quashing of the charge sheet or the order taking cognizance, therefore\r\nchallenge to Annexure\u2212A is not maintainable;\r\n5 (2007) 4 SCC 171 6 (2017) 10 SCC 779 7 Criminal Petition No.391 of 2019 decided on 05.02.2019\r\nby the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru\r\n(v) The petitioner filed Crl.P.No.8325\/2018 seeking bail. In that petition, he raised the same\r\ncontentions. This Court while passing the order rejected the said contention and that order has\r\nattained finality. Therefore it is not open to the petitioner to challenge Annexure\u2212A on the same\r\ngrounds;\r\n(vi) The petitioner did not file any application for discharge on the same grounds, under such\r\ncircumstances, Annexure\u2212A is vexatious; &\r\n(vii) The judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable.\u201D The High\r\nCourt then adverted to the decisions relied upon by the prosecution, namely, Vinod G. Asrani vs.\r\nState of Maharashtra8, John D\u2019Souza vs. Assistant Commissioner of Police9, Prasad Shrikant\r\nPurohit vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr.10, Govind Sakharam Ubhe vs. State of Maharashtra11,\r\nDigvijay Saroha vs. State12 and K.T.

P.No.5507\/2019 decided on 10.01.2020 by the High Court of\r\nKarnataka at Bengaluru\r\n10. After having noted the rival submissions, the High Court posed a question to itself whether\r\nSection 3 of the 2000 Act applies to the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N?\r\n11. The High Court noted the role of the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N, as imputed by the\r\nprosecution, that he had acted on instructions of co\u2212accused Amol Kale 14 to take a house on rent in\r\nTagachukuppe, Kumbalgodu in the guise of running an acupressure clinic, which was in fact meant\r\nto accommodate the members of the syndicate and even after commission of murder of Gauri\r\nLankesh, he harboured the actual assailants therein. The High Court then noted the fact that\r\naccused Nos.3, 5, 7 to 9, 11, 13 to 16 were not chargesheeted in any single case for cognizable\r\noffences, nor cognizance of such offences had been taken by a competent court against them as\r\nrequired under Section 2(1)(d) of the 2000 Act. The High Court then noticing the exposition in Lalit\r\nSomdatta Nagpal15, Brijesh Singh16 and Muniraju R.17, opined 14 Not named in FIR No.221\/2017\r\nand in the preliminary chargesheet; shown as accused No.3 in the prior approval and as accused\r\nNo.1 in the additional chargesheet.\r\n15 supra at Footnote No.5 16 supra at Footnote No.6 17 supra at Footnote No.7 that in absence of at\r\nleast two chargesheets filed against the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N in respect of specified\r\noffences and of which cognizance had been taken by the competent Court as required to attract the\r\noffence of organized crime, he was not engaged in continuing unlawful activity. On this finding, the\r\nHigh Court concluded that the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N cannot be proceeded further and\r\nthus, partly allowed the writ petition by not only quashing the order dated 14.08.2018 of the\r\nCommissioner of Police, Bengaluru City according approval for invoking Section 3 of the 2000 Act,\r\nbut also the chargesheet filed against the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N for offences punishable\r\nunder Section 3(1)(i), 3(2), 3(3) and 3(4) of the 2000 Act. As regards the decisions relied upon by\r\nthe prosecution, the High Court noted that the same were of no avail to the prosecution.\r\n12. Being aggrieved, the complainant\u2212Kavitha Lankesh as well as the State of Karnataka have filed\r\nseparate appeals before this Court questioning the correctness of the view taken by the High Court.\r\nThe arguments as canvassed before the High Court have been reiterated by both sides including\r\nreliance has been placed on the reported decisions referred hitherto.\r\n13. We have heard Mr. Huzefa Ahmedi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant\u2212Kavitha\r\nLankesh, Mr. V.N. Raghupathy, learned Counsel for the State of Karnataka and Mr. Basava Prabhu\r\nS. Patil, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the private respondent.\r\n14. To recapitulate the relevant factual background, be it noted that FIR under Section 154 of the\r\nCriminal Procedure Code was registered with Rajarajeshwari Nagar Police Station being Crime\r\nNo.221\/2017 dated 05.09.2017 initially for offences punishable under Section 302 of the IPC and\r\nSection 25 of the Arms Act at the instance of the appellant\u2212Kavitha Lankesh against unknown\r\npersons. Considering the nature of offence, the Government of Karnataka constituted a SIT videorder dated 06.09.2017 headed by Mr. B.K. Singh, IPS, IGP, Intelligence, Bengaluru. Mr. M.N.\r\nAnucheth, IPS, DCP (West) was nominated as the Chief Investigating Officer of the SIT. The SIT\r\nafter taking over the investigation submitted preliminary chargesheet dated 29.05.2018 against\r\naccused K.T. Naveen Kumar @ Naveen 18 before the concerned Court for offences punishable under\r\nSections 302, 114, 118, 120B and 35 of the IPC read with Sections 3 and 25 of the Arms Act. The\r\npreliminary chargesheet was accompanied with documents and list of witnesses. On the basis of\r\nmaterial collected during further investigation, report dated 07.08.2018 was submitted by the Chief\r\nInvestigating Officer of the SIT to the Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru City for according prior\r\napproval for invoking provisions of the 2000 Act in respect of crime already registered. The\r\nCommissioner of Police, Bengaluru City after going through the stated report, entire investigation\r\npapers and record of evidence collected until then, was satisfied that the accused Parshuram\r\nWagmore19, Amith Baddi20, and Ganesh 18 Not named in FIR No.221\/2017; shown as accused\r\nNo.1 in the preliminary chargesheet and in prior approval and as accused No.17 in the additional\r\nchargesheet.\r\n19 Not named in FIR No.221\/2017 and in the preliminary chargesheet; shown as accused No.7 in the\r\nprior approval and as accused No.2 in the additional chargesheet.\r\n20 Not named in FIR No.221\/2017 and in the preliminary chargesheet; shown as accused No.10 in\r\nthe prior approval and as accused No.4 in the additional chargesheet.\r\nMiskin21 were involved in more than two specified offences in the past through their illegal actions\r\nof sedition, promoting enmity between two groups of people, inciting communal violence, assaulting\r\nand injuring public servants, damaging public property and causing grave disturbance to public\r\norder. The Commissioner of Police also recorded his satisfaction that K.T. Naveen Kumar @\r\nNaveen, Sujith Kumar22, Amol Kale and Amit Degvekar23, have jointly committed an offence\r\nhaving punishment of three years or more within the preceding period of ten years and the\r\nchargesheet(s) had been filed against them before the competent Court and cognizance thereof has\r\nbeen taken. He then formed an opinion that these accused had jointly conspired to assassinate one\r\nProf. K.S. Bhagawan for expressing his views which were inimical to that of their ideology. They\r\nintended to instil fear in the hearts and minds of those whose views were antithesis to their own 21\r\nNot named in FIR No.221\/2017 and in the preliminary chargesheet; shown as accused No.9 in the\r\nprior approval and as accused No.3 in the additional chargesheet.\r\n22 Not named in FIR No.221\/2017 and in the preliminary chargesheet; shown as accused No.2 in\r\nthe prior approval and as accused No.13 in the additional chargesheet.\r\n23 Not named in FIR No.221\/2017 and in the preliminary chargesheet; shown as accused No.4 in\r\nthe prior approval and as accused No.5 in the additional chargesheet.\r\nviews and stifle the fundamental right of free speech and expression. The Commissioner of Police\r\nwas also convinced that the arrested accused Nos.1 to 12 and the absconding accused No.5 were\r\nactive members of an organized crime syndicate and have committed the present offence in\r\nfurtherance of their organized crime activity in order to promote insurgency. The Commissioner of\r\nPolice adverted to the findings in the investigation record revealing that one Rajesh D. Bangera24\r\ngave training in arms to various members of the syndicate since 2012 at various places in and\r\naround Karnataka and Maharashtra. After having taken note of these facts, the Commissioner of\r\nPolice recorded his satisfaction in the following words:\r\n\u201CInvestigation findings have clearly revealed that these members of the organized\r\ncrime syndicate were in constant touch with one another and actively underwent\r\narms training, arms shooting practice, crude bomb making and indoctrination. They\r\nmet, conspired and trained at various places in and around Karnataka and\r\nMaharashtra with the intention of promoting insurgency. Documents seized during\r\nthe investigation clearly reveal the intention of the accused to assassinate 8\r\nwriters\/thinkers of Karnataka and 26 other writers\/thinkers from the rest of the\r\ncountry.\r\n24 Not named in FIR No.221\/2017 and in the preliminary chargesheet; shown as accused No.11 in\r\nthe prior approval and as accused No.8 in the additional chargesheet.\r\nDocuments seized in the course of investigation conducted reveal the plans of how the organized\r\ncrime syndicate intended to cause grave disturbance to public order during the release of a movie\r\ntitled \u2018Padmaavat\u2019 by attacking films theatres where the said movie would have been exhibited by\r\nthe use of deadly substances like petrol bombs, acid etc. and cause bodily harm to the viewers and\r\neconomically hurt the film distributors. These documents further reveal the intention of the\r\nsyndicate to procure and use RDX, petrol bombs, acids, poisons and other incendiary and chemical\r\nmaterials.\r\nInvestigation findings have prima facie revealed that these members of the organized crime\r\nsyndicate conspired and murdered Ms. Gauri Lankesh to further their cause and to promote\r\ninsurgency.\r\nThus, on perusal and evaluation of the entire material brought on record and also taking into\r\nconsideration the factual circumstances of the case including the proximity and time gap in\r\ncommitting the crimes and having applied my mind, I am satisfied and convinced that the arrested\r\nand wanted accused have committed the offence as defined in section 2(1) of the Karnataka Control\r\nof Organized Crimes Act, 2000.\r\nNOW, THEREFORE, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by Section 24(1)(a) of the said\r\nAct, I, T. Suneel Kumar, IPS, Additional Director General of Police and Commissioner of Police,\r\nBengaluru City hereby grant\/accord my prior approval to invoke Section 3 of The Karnataka Control\r\nof Organized Crimes Act 2000, to Sri M.N. Anucheth, IPS, DCP (Administration), Bengaluru City\r\nand Chief Investigating Officer (Special Investigation Team) in the Bengaluru City Rajarajeshwari\r\nNagar Police Station Crime No. 221\/217 u\/s 302, 120(B), 118, 114 r\/w 35 of Indian Penal Code and\r\n3, 25 of Indian Arms Act.\r\nSri M.N. Anucheth, Chief Investigating Officer, shall scrupulously follow and comply with the\r\nprovisions of The Karnataka Control of Organized Crimes Act, 2000.\r\nThis order given under my signature and seal today i.e. 14th August, 2018.\u201D\r\n15. It is plain that tangible material was placed before the Commissioner regarding information\r\nabout the commission of an organized crime by the members of organized crime syndicate, which\r\nwarranted grant of prior approval to invoke Section 3 of the 2000 Act. This prior approval was\r\nassailed before the High Court by way of writ petition filed much after the appropriate authority had\r\nalready accorded sanction and the competent court had taken cognizance of that crime on\r\n17.12.2018.\r\n16. The High Court opened the judgment by noting that the challenge is to the order dated\r\n14.08.2018 of the Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru City granting approval to invoke Section 3 of\r\nthe 2000 Act. In the latter part of the judgment, however, it posed a wrong question to itself which\r\nwas obviously not relevant at this stage \u2014 as to whether Section 3 of the 2000 Act applies to the writ\r\npetitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N? Notably, the High Court was not called upon nor has it analysed the\r\nentire material collected by the Investigating Agency, which had been made part of the chargesheet\r\nfiled before the competent Court and in respect of which cognizance is also taken.\r\n17. For the time being for deciding the matter in issue, there is no need to advert to the contents of\r\nthe chargesheets and the material collated during the investigation by the SIT against each of the\r\naccused in respect of which cognizance has already been taken by the competent Court.\r\n18. The moot question to be answered in these appeals is about the purport of Section 24 of the\r\n2000 Act. Section 24(1)(a), which is crucial for our purpose, reads thus:\r\n\u201C24. Cognizance of and investigation into an offence.\u2212(1) Notwithstanding anything\r\ncontained in the Code, \u2212\r\n(a) No information about the commission of an offence of organized crime under this\r\nAct shall be recorded by a police officer without the prior approval of the police\r\nofficer not below the rank of the Deputy Inspector General of Police;\r\n\u2026...\u201D\r\n19. The purport of this section, upon its textual construct, posits that information regarding\r\ncommission of an offence of organized crime under the 2000 Act can be recorded by a police officer\r\nonly upon obtaining prior approval of the police officer not below the rank of the Deputy Inspector\r\nGeneral of Police. That is the quintessence for recording of offence of organized crime under the Act\r\nby a police officer.\r\n20. What is crucial in this provision is the factum of recording of offence of organized crime and not\r\nof recording of a crime against an offender as such. Further, the right question to be posed at thisstage is: whether prior approval accorded by the competent authority under Section 24(1)(a) is\r\nvalid? In that, whether there was discernible information about commission of an offence of\r\norganized crime by known and unknown persons as being members of the organized crime\r\nsyndicate? Resultantly, what needed to be enquired into by the appropriate authority (in the present\r\ncase, Commissioner of Police) is: whether the factum of commission of offence of organized crime\r\nby an organized crime syndicate can be culled out from the material placed before him for grant of\r\nprior approval? That alone is the question to be enquired into even by the Court at this stage. It is\r\ncardinal to observe that only after registration of FIR, investigation for the concerned offence would\r\nproceed \u2014 in which the details about the specific role and the identity of the persons involved in\r\nsuch offence can be unravelled and referred to in the chargesheet to be filed before the competent\r\nCourt.\r\n21. Concededly, the original FIR registered in the present case was for an ordinary crime of murder\r\nagainst unknown persons. At the relevant time, the material regarding offence having been\r\ncommitted by an organized crime syndicate was not known. That information came to the fore only\r\nafter investigation of the offence by the SIT, as has been mentioned in the report submitted to the\r\nCommissioner of Police, Bengaluru City for seeking his prior approval to invoke Section 3 of the\r\n2000 Act. Once again, at this stage, the Commissioner of Police had focussed only on the factum of\r\ninformation regarding the commission of organized crime by an organized crime syndicate and on\r\nbeing prima facie satisfied about the presence of material on record in that regard, rightly proceeded\r\nto accord prior approval for invoking Section 3 of the 2000 Act. The prior approval was not for\r\nregistering crime against individual offenders as such, but for recording of information regarding\r\ncommission of an offence of organized crime under the 2000 Act. Therefore, the specific role of the\r\nconcerned accused is not required to be and is not so mentioned in the stated prior approval. That\r\naspect would be unravelled during the investigation, after registration of offence of organized crime.\r\nThe High Court, thus, examined the matter by applying erroneous scale. The observations made by\r\nthe High Court in the impugned judgment clearly reveal that it has glossed over the core and\r\ntangible facts.\r\n22. Notably, the High Court, without analysing the material presented along with chargesheet on the\r\nbasis of which cognizance has been taken by the competent Court including against the writ\r\npetitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N, concerning commission of organized crime by the organized crime\r\nsyndicate of which he is allegedly a member, committed manifest error and exceeded its jurisdiction\r\nin quashing the chargesheet filed before the competent Court qua the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan\r\nNayak.N regarding offences under Section 3(1)(i), 3(2), 3(3) and 3(4) of the 2000 Act. The High\r\nCourt did so being impressed by the exposition of this Court in Lalit Somdatta Nagpal25, in\r\nparticular paragraph 63 thereof. Indeed, that exposition would have bearing only if the entire\r\nmaterial was to be analysed by the High Court to conclude that the facts do not disclose justification\r\nfor application of provisions of the 2000 Act including qua the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N,\r\nprovided he was being proceeded only for offence of organized crime punishable under Section 3(1)\r\nof the 2000 Act. For, the reported decision deals with the argument regarding invocation of\r\nprovision analogous to Section 3(1) of the 2000 Act. Be it noted that requirement of more than two\r\nchargesheets is in reference to the continuing unlawful activities of the organized crime syndicate\r\nand not qua individual member thereof. Reliance was also placed on Brijesh Singh26. Even this\r\ndecision is of no avail to the private respondent\u2212Mohan Nayak.N for the same reason noted whilst\r\ndistinguishing Lalit Somdatta Nagpal27. Further, the questions considered in that case, as can be\r\ndiscerned from paragraph 12 of the reported decision, are regarding jurisdiction of the competent\r\nCourt to take notice of chargesheets filed against the accused 25 supra at Footnote No.5 26 supra at\r\nFootnote No.6 (paragraph 25) 27 supra at Footnote No.5 outside the State. It is not an authority on\r\nthe issue under consideration.\r\n23. We may hasten to add that the fact that the Investigating Agency was unable to collect material\r\nduring investigation against the writ petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N for offence under Section 3(1) of\r\nthe 2000 Act, does not mean that the information regarding commission of a crime by him within\r\nthe meaning of Section 3(2), 3(3) or 3(4) of the 2000 Act cannot be recorded and investigated\r\nagainst him as being a member of the organized crime syndicate and\/or having played role of an\r\nabettor, being party to the conspiracy to commit organized crime or of being a facilitator, as the case\r\nmay be. For the latter category of offence, it is not essential that more than two chargesheets have\r\nbeen filed against the person so named, before a competent court within the preceding period of ten\r\nyears and that court had taken cognizance of such offence. That requirement applies essentially to\r\nan offence punishable only under Section 3(1) of the 2000 Act.\r\n24. As regards offences punishable under Section 3(2), 3(3), 3(4) or 3(5), it can proceed against any\r\nperson sans such previous offence registered against him, if there is material to indicate that he\r\nhappens to be a member of the organized crime syndicate who had committed the offences in\r\nquestion and it can be established that there is material about his nexus with the accused who is a\r\nmember of the organized crime syndicate. This position is expounded in the case of Ranjitsingh\r\nBrahmajeetsing Sharma vs. State of Maharashtra28 which has been quoted with approval in\r\nparagraph 85 of the judgment in Prasad Shrikant Purohit29. The same reads thus:\r\n\u201C85. A reading of para 31 in Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma case30 shows that in\r\norder to invoke MCOCA even if a person may or may not have any direct role to play\r\nas regards the commission of an organised crime, if a nexus either with an accused\r\nwho is a member of an \u201Corganised crime syndicate\u201D or with the offence in the nature\r\nof an \u201Corganised crime\u201D is established that would attract the invocation of Section\r\n3(2) of MCOCA. Therefore, even if one may not have any direct role to play relating to\r\nthe commission of an \u201Corganised crime\u201D, but when the nexus of such person with an\r\naccused who is a member of the \u201Corganised crime syndicate\u201D or such nexus is related\r\nto the offence in the nature of 28 (2005) 5 SCC 294 29 supra at Footnote No.10 30\r\nsupra at Footnote No.28 \u201Corganised crime\u201D is established by showing his involvement\r\nwith the accused or the offence in the nature of such \u201Corganised crime\u201D, that by itself\r\nwould attract the provisions of MCOCA. The said statement of law by this Court,\r\ntherefore, makes the position clear as to in what circumstances MCOCA can be\r\napplied in respect of a person depending upon his involvement in an organised crime\r\nin the manner set out in the said paragraph. In paras 36 and 37, it was made further\r\nclear that such an analysis to be made to ascertain the invocation of MCOCA against a\r\nperson need not necessarily go to the extent for holding a person guilty of such\r\noffence and that even a finding to that extent need not be recorded.\r\nBut such findings have to be necessarily recorded for the purpose of arriving at an objective finding\r\non the basis of materials on record only for the limited purpose of grant of bail and not for any other\r\npurpose. Such a requirement is, therefore, imminent under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA.\u201D (emphasis\r\nsupplied)\r\n25. It is not necessary to multiply authorities in this regard. Suffice it to observe that the High Court\r\nin the present case was essentially concerned with the legality of prior approval granted by the\r\nCommissioner of Police, Bengaluru City dated 14.08.2018 for invoking Section 3 of the 2000 Act\r\nand thus, to allow recording of information regarding commission of offence of organized crime\r\nunder the 2000 Act and to investigate the same. As aforesaid, while considering the proposal for\r\ngrant of prior approval under Section 24(1)(a) of the 2000 Act, what is essential is the satisfaction of\r\nthe competent authority that the material placed before him does reveal presence of credible\r\ninformation regarding commission of an offence of organized crime by the organized crime\r\nsyndicate and, therefore, allow invocation of Section 3 of the 2000 Act. As a consequence of which,\r\ninvestigation of that crime can be taken forward by the Investigating Agency and chargesheet can be\r\nfiled before the concerned Court and upon grant of sanction by the competent authority under\r\nSection 24(2), the competent Court can take cognizance of the case.\r\n26. At the stage of granting prior approval under Section 24(1)(a) of the 2000 Act, therefore, the\r\ncompetent authority is not required to wade through the material placed by the Investigating\r\nAgency before him along with the proposal for grant of prior approval to ascertain the specific role\r\nof each accused. The competent authority has to focus essentially on the factum whether the\r\ninformation\/material reveals the commission of a crime which is an organized crime committed by\r\nthe organized crime syndicate. In that, the prior approval is qua offence and not the offender as\r\nsuch. As long as the incidents referred to in earlier crimes are committed by a group of persons and\r\none common individual was involved in all the incidents, the offence under the 2000 Act can be\r\ninvoked. This Court in Prasad Shrikant Purohit31 in paragraphs 61 and 98 expounded that at the\r\nstage of taking cognizance, the competent Court takes cognizance of the offence and not the\r\noffender. This analogy applies even at the stage of grant of prior approval for invocation of\r\nprovisions of the 2000 Act. The prior sanction under Section 24(2), however, may require enquiry\r\ninto the specific role of the offender in the commission of organized crime, namely, he himself singly\r\nor jointly or as a member of the organized crime syndicate indulged in commission of the stated\r\noffences so as to attract the punishment provided under Section 3(1) of the 2000 Act. However, if\r\nthe role of the offender is merely that of a facilitator or of an abettor as referred to in Section 3(2),\r\n3(3), 3(4) or 3(5), the requirement of named person being involved in more than two chargesheets\r\nregistered against him in the past is not relevant. Regardless of that, he can be proceeded under the\r\n2000 Act, if the material collected by the Investigating Agency 31 supra at Footnote No.10 reveals\r\nthat he had nexus with the accused who is a member of the organized crime syndicate or such nexus\r\nis related to the offence in the nature of organized crime. Thus, he need not be a person who had\r\ndirect role in the commission of an organized crime as such.\r\n27. A priori, the conclusion reached by the High Court in partly allowing the writ petition filed by the\r\nwrit petitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N, is manifestly wrong and cannot be countenanced. In any case, the\r\nHigh Court has completely glossed over the crucial fact that the writ petition was filed only after thesanction was accorded by the competent authority under Section 24(2) and more so cognizance was\r\nalso taken by the competent Court of the offence of organized crime committed by the members of\r\norganized crime syndicate including the writ petitioner \u2014 to which there was no challenge. The High\r\nCourt has not analysed the efficacy of these developments as disentitling the writ petitioner belated\r\nrelief claimed in respect of prior approval under Section 24(1)(a) of the 2000 Act. Further, the High\r\nCourt has clearly exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the chargesheet filed against the writ\r\npetitioner\u2212Mohan Nayak.N for offences punishable under Section 3(2), 3(3) and 3(4) of the 2000\r\nAct at this stage [of prior approval under Section 24(1)(a)].\r\n28. Taking any view of the matter, therefore, these appeals deserve to be allowed and the impugned\r\njudgment and order of the High Court needs to be set aside.\r\n29. While parting, we may clarify that rejection of writ petition filed by the private respondent\u2212\r\nMohan Nayak.N will not come in his way in pursuing other remedies as may be available to him and\r\npermissible in law. We may not be understood to have expressed any opinion either way on the\r\nmerits of such remedy. In other words, this judgment is limited to the consideration of question\r\nwhether prior approval dated 14.08.2018 granted by the Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru City, in\r\nconnection with offence registered as Crime No.221\/2017, is valid or otherwise. We have held that\r\nthe same does not suffer from any infirmity including qua private respondent\u2212Mohan Nayak.N\r\nhaving noted his intimate nexus with the brain behind the entire event being none other than Amol\r\nKale and master arms trainer Rajesh D. Bangera who are part and parcel of an organized crime\r\nsyndicate and committed organized crimes as such.\r\n30. In view of the above, the appeals are allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated\r\n22.04.2021 passed by the High Court is set aside and the writ petition filed by Mohan Nayak.N\r\nstands dismissed.\r\nPending application(s), if any, stands disposed of.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.
