        "judgement": "Writ Petition (Criminal) Nos. 64 to 70 of 1983. Under article 32 of the Constitution of India Mrs. Urmila Sirur, Sanjeev Puri and Amerdeep Jaiswal for the Petitioners. Harbans Singh and S.K. Bagga for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR, J. In the context of the right of the 'lifers' (prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment prior to 18th December, 743 1978 being the date of coming into force of sec. 433A, Cr.P.C.) to have their cases considered for pre mature release under the Punjab Jail Manual two contentions were urged by counsel appearing for the lifers before us in the above matters. First, it was contended that such lifers were entitled to have their cases for pre mature release considered by the concerned authorities on completion of ten years of sentence inclusive of remissions in the case of a female prisoner or a male prisoner of under 20 years of age at the date of the commission of the offence or completion of 14 years of sentence inclusive of remissions in the case of adult prisoners under Para 516 B of the Punjab Jail Manual but since November, 1971 the authorities concerned are not submitting their cases for such consideration until actual substantive imprisonment has been undergone for 6 years in case of female prisoners and prisoners below 20 years at the date of the commission of the offence and 8 years in case of adult prisoners and in that behalf certain executive instructions issued by the Punjab Government on 6th August, 1971 are being relied upon but according to the counsel for the lifers such executive instructions issued in 1971 cannot affect the right conferred upon the lifers under Para 516 B which has the force of a statutory rule and Statutory Rules cannot be amended or altered by any executive instructions; hence the lifers concerned in these matters are entitled to have their cases considered for pre mature release since they satisfy the requirements of Para 516 B of the Punjab Jail Manual. In this behalf counsel relied upon the Punjab High Court's decision dated 9.11.1982 in Naranjan Singh's case (which decision is subject matter of challenge in Criminal Appeal arising from leave being granted in SLP (Crl. No. 499/1983). In other words, counsel canvassed for acceptance of the Punjab High Court's view in the aforesaid case by this Court. Secondly, counsel for the lifers urged that the State of Punjab has been erroneously making a distinction between cases of Prisoners who have been sentenced to death but whose sentences, on mercy petitions, have been commuted to life imprisonment and prisoners who have been straightaway sentenced to life imprisonment in the matter of consideration of their cases for pre mature release in that, in the case of the former completion of 14 years of actual sentence is insisted upon while in the case of the latter only 8 years of actual sentence is regarded as sufficient for such consideration, the case of Tapinder Singh s/o Manjit Singh, the petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 68 of 1983 being in point. According to counsel the State Government in this behalf has been relying upon certain executive instructions issued on 30th of January, 1976 but counsel pointed out that in the case of Mehar Singh vs State of Punjab(1) a Single Judge of the Punjab High Court held that those instructions will not be applicable to cases of prisoners convicted earlier to that date and Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 2142 of 1982 preferred by the State of Punjab against that decision was dismissed by this Court on 18th of February, 1983 and, therefore, it is not open to the State Government to rely upon those executive instructions issued on 30th January, 1976 for making the distinction and postponing the consideration of the cases of prisoners falling within the former category until 14 years of actual imprisonment has been suffered by them. Paragraph 516 B of the Punjab Jail Manual runs thus: 516 B. (a) With the exception of females and of males who were under 20 years of age at the time of commission of offence, the cases of every convicted prisoner sentenced to: (i) Imprisonment for life. (ii) Imprisonment/s for life and term/s of imprisonment. (iii) Cumulative Periods of Rigorous imprisonment aggregating of more than 14 years. (iv) a single sentence of more than 20 years.: (a) who has undergone a period of detention in jail amounting together with remission earned to 14 years, shall be submitted through the Inspectors General of Prisons, Punjab for the orders of the State Government. (b) the case of a female prisoner and of a male prisoner under 20 years of age at the time of commission of offence, who is undergoing (i) Imprisonment/s for life. (ii) Imprisonment/s for life and a term/s of imprisonment. 745 (iii) Cumulative periods of Rigorous imprisonment aggregating to more than 10 years. or; (iv) A single sentence of more than 20 years shall be submitted through the Inspector General of Prisons, Punjab, for the orders of the State Government when the prisoner has undergone a period of detention in jail amounting together with remission earned to 10 years. (v) Notwithstanding anything contained above, a Superintendent, Jail may, in his discretion, refer at any time, for the orders of the State Government through the Inspector General of Prisoners, Punjab, the case of any prisoner sentenced to imprisonment for life whose sentence might in the Superintendent's opinion be suitably commuted into a term of imprisonment. It appears that from time to time the State Government had been examining the question of, and the procedure for, submission of Roles for pre mature release of prisoners as contained in the aforesaid Para 516 B of the Manual and after considerable deliberation the State Government took a policy decision in 1971 and issued instructions (hereinafter called 'the 1971 Instructions') providing that a period of actual sentence of 8 years in the case of adult lifers and 6 years in the case of female prisoners and those below 20 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence should be regarded as the qualifying period for consideration of their cases for pre mature release and in this behalf a Memorandum No. 133116JJ 71/39656 dated 10th of November, 1971 containing the aforesaid instructions was issued by the State Government to the Inspector General of Prisons, Punjab and it was clarified that all cases of prisoners should be sent for consideration of their pre mature release in the light of said policy decision with effect from 2nd of November, 1971. It further appears that the question of releasing pre maturely life convicts whose death sentence has been commuted was again considered by the State Government and it took a policy decision in January, 1976 that cases of such life convicts should be considered for pre mature release only after completion 14 years of actual imprisonment and in that behalf a Memorandum No. 403 6JJ 76/3456 dated 30th January, 1976 containing the necessary instructions (hereinafter called 'the 1976 Instructions') was issued by the State Government to the Inspector General of Prisons, Punjab with a 746 request to direct the Superintendents of Jails to submit cases of such life convicts for pre mature release accordingly. (Copies of the Memoranda dated 10th of November, 1971 and 30th January, 1976 have been annexed as Annexures and to the Affidavit of Shri C.L. Goel in support of the SLP No 499/1983 filed by the State of Punjab in Naranjan Singh's case. (Proceedings of SLP No. 499/83 were made available to us at the hearing.) It may be stated that these 1971 Instructions and 1976 Instructions though not incorporated in the Punjab Jail Manual as yet, are being followed and implemented and it appears that relying on these Instructions the Jail Authorities are not submitting cases of the concerned lifers to the State Government for pre mature release though they may have suffered the qualifying punishment under para 516 B of the Manual. Hence Counsel for the petitioners herein has raised the two contentions mentioned above. In our view, for the reasons which we are indicating presently, there is no substance in either of these contentions. It is well settled as result of the Privy Council decision in Pandit KishoriLal's (1) case and this Court's decisions in Gopal Godse's (2) case, Maru Ram's (3) case and Kartar Singh's (4) case that a sentence of imprisonment for life is a sentence for the remainder of the natural life of the convict and there is no question releasing such a convict earlier in the absence of a formal order of commutation passed by the State Government either under sec. 55, IPC. or sec, 433 (b) of Cr. P.C. 1973 and that even the Remission Rules, though statutory, cannot over ride the statutory provisions contained in the Penal Code. In other words, unlike the cases of prisoners sentenced to terms of imprisonment, in the case of lifers even the Remission Rules though statutory are of no avail in the absence of a formal order of commutation either under sec. 55, IPC. or sec. 433 (b) of Cr. P.C. 1973. Admittedly, in the case of none of the petitioners before us has any order of commutation been passed by the State Government under either of the said provisions and the petitioners are merely relying upon para 516 B of the Punjab Jail Manual for contending that they are entitled to have their cases considered for pre mature release since they have undergone the requisite period of punishment 14 years/10 years inclusive of remissions as per the provisions of the said para and the contention is that since Para 516 B has the force of statutory rule the subsequent executive instructions (the 1971 Instructions or the 1976 Instructions) issued by the State Government cannot adversely affect their said right in as much as the effect of a statutory rule cannot be whittled down by executive instructions. On the other hand counsel for the State contended that the provisions contained in Para 516 B were themselves executive instructions and not a statutory rule and as such these could be amended or altered from time to time by fresh executive instructions issued by the State Government and therefore the petitioners' cases were not submitted to the concerned authorities for consideration of their pre mature release because of the subsequent executive instructions issued in 1971 and 1976. We find ample material on record which supports the contention of counsel for the State. In the first place, it may be stated that the marginal note against Para 516 B of the Punjab Jail Manual (1975 edition) clearly shows that the provisions thereof are based on a Government of India Resolution No. 159 167 dated 6th September, 1905, copy whereof was produced before us and the contents of the Resolution clearly show that various questions such as the places where transported prisoners should be kept, the nature of their punishment, remission of sentences, pre mature releases, etc. had engaged the attention of Government of India and decisions were taken on those questions. In particular the Resolution records that the majority of the authorities consulted were in favour of the proposal of the U.P. Government that when the term of imprisonment undergone together with any remission earned under the rules amounted to 14 years the question of remitting the remainder of the imprisonment should be raised and the Governor General in Council was accordingly pleased to direct that such a rule 'shall be ordinarily adopted in future, though he would not, however, lay down that such prisoners must always be released at the end of the 14 years and it would still be open to, and indeed incumbent on, the Local Government to take into consideration, when deciding on the remission to be granted, circumstances of each, case, the character of the convict, his conduct in prison and the probability of his reverting to criminal habits or instigating others to commit crimes'. What is more copies of the Resolution were forwarded to various State Government 'for information and guidance.' This clearly shows that the contents of Government's Resolution dated 6th September, 1905, on which para 516 B of the Punjab Jail Manual is based, were in the nature of executive instructions by way of guidance and not any hard and fast rule, must less a statutory rule. Secondly, this position has been sufficiently clarified at two places in the Punjab Jail Manual (1975 edition) itself. In the preface to that edition it has been clearly stated that the Paragraphs of the Manual against which a black line (side line) appears are in substance, either quotations from the Law or from the Rules having the force of the law while the portions of the Manual without a black line (side line) are executive instruction which have from time to time been issued by the Government of India, Local Government or the Inspector General with the sanction and approval from the Local Government and para 516 B is not side lined by any black line. Again, Chapter XX which deals with remission system contains Para 631 to 650 which comprise what in terms are called 'remission rules' presumably having statutory force since these paras are all side lined, but what is of importance is that at the foot of para 631 there is a Note which is nothing but a reproduction of para 516 B and at the end of Remission Rules (foot of para 650) there is a Nota bene which says that the Note to para 631 should not be regarded as part of the Statutory Rules but the same has been inserted for convenience of reference and with the object of assisting officers to interpret the rules. It is thus clear that para 516 B of the Manual itself contained executive instructions and had no force of a statutory rule. If that be so it would always be open to the State Government from time to time to alter or amend or even withdraw such executive instructions by issuing fresh instruction. In other words any existing executive instructions could be substituted by issuing fresh executive instructions for processing the cases of lifers for premature release but once issued these must be uniformly and invariably applied to all cases of lifers so as to avoid the charge of discrimination under article 14. Reliance by Counsel for the petitioners on the Punjab High Court's decision in Naranjan Singh's case would be of no avail However, we would like to observe that in that case the fact that the State Government had issued the 1971 Instructions which substituted para 516 B of the Manual was not properly placed before it and in the absence of such proper material the High Court took the view that the convict's case for per mature release was required to be considered in the light of the provisions of para 516 B. The view of the Punjab High Court cannot obviously be accepted. The first contention urged by counsel therefore has to be rejected. The second contention also must fail in view of the admitted position that cases of prisoners who have been sentenced to death but whose sentence on mercy petitions has been commuted to life imprisonment (who constitute a distinct class) will now be governed by the 1976 Instructions. Here also the view of the Punjab High Court in the case of Mehar Singh (supra) that the 1976 Instructions issued on 30th of January, 1976 will not be applicable to cases of prisoners convicted earlier to that date is not tenable. Clearly existing cases of life convicts falling within that category will be governed by those instructions. It is true that SLP (Crl) No. 2142/1982 preferred by State of Punjab against that decision was dismissed by this Court on 18th February, 1983 but the dismissal order passed by this Court itself indicates that this Court did so not because it approved the view of the Punjab High Court but that it 'did not consider this to be a proper cases for interference in view of the peculiar facts of that case'. This Court did not desire on the facts of that case to interfere with the direction given that the case of the convict should be submitted for consideration of his premature release. Having regard to the above discussion it is clear there is no entitlement on the part of the petitioners other than Jang Singh and Mukhtiar Singh to have their cases considered for pre mature release immediately in view of 1971/1976 Instruction. Their Writ Petitions are therefore dismissed. So far as Jang Singh s/o Bagga Singh and Mukhtiar Singh s/o Harnam Singh are concerned even the Counter Affidavit of Shri K.C. Mahajan shows that in accordance with the 1971 Instruction they have undergone more than 8 years of actual imprisonment and as such they have the entitlement. We therefore issue a writ of Mandamus that their cases be submitted for consideration of premature release forth with without any delay. H.S.K. Two petitions allowed and five petitions dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeals Nos. 228 to 230 of 1958. Appeals from the judgment and decree dated July 2, 1957, of the Patna High Court in Misc. Judicial Case No. 640 of 1955. 59 N. A. Palkhivala, Thakur Prasad and R. C. Prasad for the appellant. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General of India, R. Ganapathy Iyer and D. Gupta, for the respondent. February 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J. The appellant is a. Bank registered under the Co operative Societies Act, 1912 (Act II of 1912) and is deemed to be registered under the Bihar & Orissa Co operative Societies Act, 1935 (Bihar Act VI of 1935) which in Bihar has replaced. the Cooperative Societies Act of 1912. It was carrying on banking business in the State of Bihar. One of the objects of the Bank is to carry on general business of banking not repugnant to the provisions of the Bihar Act and rules framed thereunder for the time being in force (Bye Law 3(a)vi). In the calendar years 1945, 1946 and 1947, the appellant Bank received by way of interest on deposits with the Imperial Bank of India the sums of Rs. 7,192, Rs. 20,250 and Rs. 22,600 respectively. It is these sums which are the subject matter of dispute in these three appeals which relate to the respective assessment years 1946 47, 1947 48 and 1948 49. These sums were not assessed when assessment was made under section 23(3) of the Income tax Act, but subsequently under section 34 they were assessed as being 'income ' under the head \" other sources '. This order was upheld by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal. A case was then stated to the High Court under section 66(1) of the Act, but was decided against the appellant. The appellant brought three appeals in this Court in regard to the three assessment years. In each one of them the respondent is the Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar & Orissa. As the appeals involve a common question of law they were consolidated and can conveniently be disposed of by one judgment. In its return the appellant showed these various sums as I other sources ', but nothing turns on the manner in which the appellant chose to show this income in its return. The Income tax Officer, however, assessed the interest for these three years 60 under section 12 of the Income tax Act, as income from I other sources '. The appellant took an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner where it was contended that as the business of the appellant Bank consisted of lending money and the deposits had been made not for the purpose of investment but for that business and thereby fulfilling the purpose for which the Co operative Bank was constituted, these various sums of interest were not subject to income tax because of the Notification issued by the Central Government under section 60 of the Income tax Act. The relevant portion of that Notification, C.B.R. Notification No. 35 dated October 20, 1934, and No. 33 dated August 18, 1945, was : \" The following classes of income shall be exempt from the tax payable under the said Act, but shall be taken into account in determining the total income of an assessee for the purpose of the said Act : (2) The profits of any Co operative Society other than the Sanikatta Salt Owners ' Society in the Bombay Presidency for the time being registered under the (Act II of 1912), the Bombay Co operative Societies Act, 1925 (Bombay Act VII of 1925), or the Madras Cooperative Societies Act, 1932 (Madras Act VI of 1932), or the dividends or other payments received by the members of any such Society out of such profits. Explanation:For this purpose the profits of a Co operative Society shall not be deemed to include any income, profits or gains from : (1) Investments in (a) securities of the nature referred to in section 8 of the Indian Income tax Act; or (b) property of the nature referred to in section 9 of that Act; (2) dividends, or (3) the 'other sources ' referred to in section 12 of the Indian Income tax Act \". The Appellate Assistant Commissioner, however, repelled the contention of the appellant. He held that the business of the appellant consisted of I lend 61 ing money, and selling agricultural and other products to its constituents ' which could be planned ahead and required no provision for extraordinary claims. He remarked that it appeared from the balance sheets that in the accounting year 1945 the Bank invested Rs. 13,50,000 as fixed deposits, which, in the following year was raised to Rs. 15,00,000 and it was only in the accounting year 1947 that the fixed deposits ` were realised on maturity with interest '. He was also of the opinion that the length of the period during which this money I was kept locked in this way ' showed clearly that I not the exigencies of pressing necessities, but the motives of investment of surplus fund had actuated the deposits '. He therefore held that the fixed deposits with the Imperial Bank were held as an investment quite apart from the business of the appellant and the interest from these deposits was not exempt from income tax. He further held that the exemption as to the profit of a Co operative Society extended to its sphere of co operative activities and therefore interest from investments was no part of the appellant 's business profits exempt from taxation. Against this order an appeal was 'taken to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal and it was there contended that the Bank did not make the deposits as investments, but in order that cash might be available to the appellant 'continuously ' for the carrying on of the purposes of its business, and that the deposits were intimately connected with the business of the appellant and therefore the interest should have been held to be profits arising from the business activities of the Bank, and that the finding that the short term deposits in the Imperial Bank were separate from the appellant 's banking business was erroneous. The Income tax Appellate Tribunal, by its order dated April 11, 1955, held: \" (1) That the interest was an income rightly to be included under the head of I other sources '. (2) The profits of a Co operative Society indicates the profit derived from the business which can be truly called the business of the Co operative 62 Society. Investments by the society either in securities or in shares or in bank fixed deposits are made out of surplus funds. The interest or dividend derived from such investment cannot be regarded as part of the profits of the business (sic) qua such bank and therefore, it is not exempt from income tax (Vide Hoshiarvur Central Co operative Bank vs Commissioner of Income tax (1),) \" Against this order a case was stated at the instance of the appellant under section 66(1) of the Act, and the following two questions of law were referred for the opinion of the High Court; (1) Whether, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the receipt of interest on fixed deposits was an income under the head of I other sources ': and (2) Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the receipt of interest from the fixed deposits was an income not exempt from taxation under the C. B. R. Notification No. 35 dated 20th October, 1934 and No. 33 dated the 18th August, 1945. In the High Court the appellant 's contention was that the fixed deposits were made with the Imperial Bank of India not with the idea of making investments, but for the reason that cash should be available to the appellant is and when it was needed for the purposes of its business. It was also contended that the deposits were short term deposits and that the Bank could not carry on its business without such short term deposits. In other words, the contention was that making deposits with the Imperial Bank was intimately connected with the business activities of the appellant Bank and that the interest received on the deposits was profit attributable to its business activities. But the High Court did not accept this contention. It held that if the income derived by a Co operative Society was from the business of the Co operative Society as such, it fell within the exemption, but if it arose out of the business with third parties as in the case of investment of surplus assets, the exemption was inapplicable because the (1) 350. 63 investment of fluid assets was not a part of the business of the Co operative Bank and the reason for the Notification was to exempt profits accruing to a Cooperative Society from ` carrying on business of a mutual co operative society and upon the ground that a man cannot make profit or loss out of himself. The ground of mutuality was not relied upon before us by the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the respondent. So the sole question for determination is whether the investment by a Cooperative Bank of its assets in fixed deposits in the manner that the appellant Bank had deposited its moneys falls within the term I business ' and is there fore assessable under section 10 of the Income tax Act, or it is an investment the interest from which would fall under the term I other sources ' and therefore within section 12 of the Income tax Act. It was contended by the learned Solicitor General that the finding of the Appellate Tribunal as to the nature of these deposits was one of fact. This contention is not sustainable. It has not been treated as a finding of fact either by the Appellate Tribunal or by the High Court. They have both treated it as a question of law and it is on that basis that the reference was made. The decision of the question depends on what is comprised within the ordinary business of a bank and whether the business of the appellant bank is in any way different. Relying upon the decision of the Privy Council in The Punjab Co operative Bank Ltd vs The Commissioner of Income tax, Punjab (1), counsel for the appellant submitted that the business of a bank is one of dealing in money and credit and that laying out moneys in deposit with other banks is just as much a mode of conducting business as lending moneys to borrowers whether members of the society or to other co operative societies, and is therefore a part of the appellant 's business. Therefore, where out of moneys in deposit with a bank a portion is put away or laid out in securities or in deposits with another banker, two objects are served: (1) the moneys which are not immediately required do not remain idle but (1) (1940] 64 earn interest; and (2) if and when money is required to meet any demand, the investment i. e. the deposits as well as the securities provide a source from which these requirements can easily be met. Thus the credit of the bank remains unimpaired and its moneys continue to earn interest. Counsel for the respondent argued that where moneys are so laid out they cannot be termed ` carrying on business of the bank ' and therefore any sums coming in from such investments cannot be termed profits arising from business, but they are income from I others sources,. In support of this argument reliance was placed by counsel on The Madras Central Urban Bank Ltd. vs Commissioner of lncome Tax (1); The Madras Provincial Co operative Bank Ltd., Madras vs Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras (2) ; Commissioner of Income Tax, Burma vs Bengalee Urban Co operative Credit Society Ltd. (3) ; Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras V. Madras Provincial Co operative Bank Ltd. (4); Hoshiarpur Central Co aperative Bank Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income Tax, Simla (5); Cochin Cottage Industries Cooperative Marketing Society Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income Tax, Mysore &C. (6). But none of these cases supports the argument raised on behalf of the respondent. In the Madras Central Urban Bank case (1) the society was required to invest 40 per cent. of its total liability under call deposits in a liquid or fluid form and the society invested it in Government securities which produced interest. It was held that interest from securities was not part of the profits of the business of the society as it was not obliged to invest in such securities. Similarly in the Madras Provincial Co operative Bank Case (2) also the income which was the subject matter of dispute was interest received by the bank from its investments in Government securities and it was held that it was not part of the income derived from its business. The Rangoon case, Commissioner of Income tax, Burma vs Bengalee Urban Co operative Credit Society (3) was also a case relating (1) I.L.R. F.B. (2) I.L.R. F.B. (3) (4) I.L.R. (5) (6) (1956] 65 to income derived from interest on capital invested in Government securities. At p. 128, Page, C. J., said: from securities nor income derived from CO property are I profits ' within the meaning of that term as used in the notification. . . . It Cc may be that investment of capital in properties or securities is part of the business of an assessee, and in such a case, in my opinion, the net income accruing from such investments would be, and be chargeable as, profits of the business \". (As the matter had not been considered from this point of view the case was sent back for doing so). These cases before the amendment of the Notification show that the income which was exempted was profit from business and not income from sources which fell under sections 8 and 9 of the Income tax Act. The Commissioner of Income tax, Madras vs The Madras Provincial Co operative Bank Ltd. (1) was a case where moneys had been invested in debentures and for reasons similar to the ones given in the cases above mentioned,, it was held that interest derived therefrom was not profits of the business. Counsel for the respondent relied on a judgment of the Punjab High Court in Hoshiarpur Central Cooperative Bank vs Commissioner of Income tax, Simla (2). In that case the Government authorised the Bank to deal in sugar, oil and standard cloth and it made profit thereform. Those activities were neither its business under the bye laws nor within its objects. The question was whether this profit was exempt from income tax on account of its being profits of a co operative society and it was held that the decided cases showed that where income was derived by a co operative society, the profits were within the exemption, but not if the business was of the nature not covered by the objects of the society. This line of reasoning has not formed part of the respondent 's argument in this Court and the case therefore has no application to the facts of the present case. The decision in Cochin Cottage Industries Co operative (1) I.L.R. (2) 9 66 Marketing Society Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income tax, Mysore & c. (1) proceeded on the same ground. In that case the profit which was held not to be exempt under the Notification was the apportioned profit of the society from its dealings with non members. In the Surat Peoples ' Co operative Bank Ltd. vs The Commissioner of Income tax, Ahmedabad (2) the profit arose during the course of banking business out of the sale of Government securities which formed part of the stock in trade and as it was a co operative bank the profits made from such sales were held to be exempt from taxation under the Notification. In the instant case the co operative society (the appellant) is a Bank. One of its objects is to carry on the general business of banking. Like other banks money is its stock in trade or circulating capital and its normal business is to deal in money and credit. It cannot be said that the business of such a Bank consists only in receiving deposits and lending money to its members or such other societies as are mentioned in the objects and that when it lays out its moneys so that they may be readily available to meet the demand of its depositors if and when they arise, it is not a legitimate mode of carrying on of its banking business. The Privy Council in The Punjab Cooperative Bank Ltd. vs The Commissioner of Incometax, Lahore (3) where the profites arose from the sale of Government securities pointed out at p. 645 that in the ordinary cases the business of a Bank essentially consists of dealing with money and credit. Depositors put their money in the Bank at a small rate of interest and in order to meet their demands if and when they arise the Bank has always to keep suffi cient cash or easily realizable securities. That is a normal step in the carrying on of the banking business. In other words I that is an act done in what is truly the carrying on or carrying out of a business '. It may be added that another mode of conducting business of a Bank is to place its funds in deposit with other banks and that also is to meet demands which may be made on it. It was however argued (1) (2) (3) 67 that in the instant case the moneys had been deposited with the Imperial Bank on long term deposits inasmuch as they were deposited for one year and were renewed from time to time also for a year; but as is shown by the accounts these deposits fell due at short intervals and would have been available to the appellant had any need arisen. Stress was laid on the use of the word I surplus ' both by the tribunal as well as by the High Court and it was also contended before us that in the byelaws under the heading I business of the bank ' it was provided that the bank could I invest surplus funds when not required for the business of the bank in one or more ways specified in section 19 of the Bihar Act (Cl. 4 111(i) of the Bye Laws). Whether funds invested as provided in section 19 of the Bihar Act would be surplus or not does not arise for decision in this case, but it has not been shown that the moneys which were in deposit with other banks were I surplus ' within that bye law so as to take it out of banking business. As we have pointed out above, it is a normal mode of carrying on banking business to invest moneys in a manner that they are readily available and that is just as much a part of the mode of conducting a Bank 's business as receiving deposits or lending moneys or discounting hundies or issuing demand drafts. That is how the circulating capital is employed and that is the normal course of business of a bank. The moneys laid out in the form of deposits as in the instant case would not cease to be a part of the circulating capital of the appellant nor would they cease to form part of its banking business. The returns flowing from them would form part of its profits from its business. In a commercial sense the directors of the company owe it to the bank to make investments which earn them interest instead of letting moneys lie idle. It cannot be said that the funds of the Bank which were not lent to borrowers but were laid out in the form of deposits in another bank to add to the profit instead of lying idle necessarily ceased to be a part of the stock in trade of the bank, or that the interest arising therefrom did not form part of its business profits. Under the bye laws 68 one of the objects of the appellant bank is to carry on the general business of banking and therefore subject to the Co operative Societies Act, it has to carry on its business in the manner that ordinary banks do. It may be added that the various heads under section 6 of the Income Tax Act 'and the provisions of that Act applicable to these various heads are mutually exclusive. Section 12 is a residuary section and does not come into operation until the preceding heads are excluded. Commissioner of Income tax vs Basant Rai Takhat Singh (1). In our opinion, the High Court was in error in treating interest derived from deposits as not arising from the business of the Bank and therefore not falling within the income exempted under the Notification. The appeal must therefore be allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court set aside. The appellant will have its costs in this Court and in the Court below. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 379 of 1986. From the Judgment and Order dated 13.7.1984 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Crl. Appeal No. 82 D.B. of 1984. R.L. Kohli and R.C. Kohli for the Appellant. R.S. Suri for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J. One may ask the question whether murder by poisoning is not run like any other murder? The learned counsel for the appellant purports to state that it is not. He relies upon the judicial prescriptions as to the burden of proof in 'poison murder' cases. He contends that the prosecution must prove 'that the accused had the poison in his possession'. He asserts that failure to establish that factor should entail the acquittal of the accused. This is a vital question which goes far beyond the case and it, therefore, requires careful consideration. Bhupinder Singh Appellant was prosecuted for the murder of his wife by poisoning. He was sentenced for life imprisonment by the Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot in Session Case No. 86 of 1983. His conviction and sentence have been affirmed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in criminal appeal No. 82 DB of 1984. He has preferred this appeal by special leave challenging the conviction and sentence. We may first advert to the prosecution case. It reveals a sad story. It runs like this: Gian Kaur, the victim in this case is the only daughter of Baltej Singh. Baltej Singh like many other parents thought that his problems would be solved by the marriage of his daughter. He got her married to Bhupinder Singh by spending all his savings. His relatives also contributed for the marriage. But ill luck would have it, his problems started immediately after the marriage. Bhupinder Singh and his parents wanted Gian Kaur to bring Rs. 10,000 from her father. It was nothing but a demand for dowry. They stopped up their demand with harassment to Gian Kaur. Gian Kaur informed her father. The father could not arrange that much of amount. He had already spent all that he had in connection with her marriage. He had also then given presents in cash and kind to Bhupinder Singh. So he felt helpless. Unmerciful, Bhupinder Singh asked his wife to go back to her parents' house. So she left to seek shelter with her parents. She remained with them for about eight months. But how long the father could keep his married daughter away from her husband. Some parents think that it is a reflection upon them. Baltej Singh also must have thought like that. He somehow arranged Rs.6,000 and sent Gian Kaur to her husband's house. Gian Kaur rejoined her husband upon making the payment of Rs.6,000. That appears to have satisfied Bhupinder Singh for about one year. In the meantime, Gian Kaur had a male child. Naturally there was jubilation for Baltej Singh. He performed the customary Chuchhak ceremony and again gave Rs.4,000 and a buffalo as presents to Bhupinder Singh. Bhupinder Singh ought to have been happy and satisfied. But he was not. It was alleged by the prosecution that this time he demanded a motorcycle. Baltej Singh could not give it. Gian Kaur, as usual, was again the target. It was further alleged by the prosecution that Bhupinder Singh threatened to kill his wife if motorcycle was not given to him. Gian Kaur had kept her father informed about the said demand and the threat. On July 13, 1983, Gian Kaur died under mysterious circumstances. Upon receiving that information, Baltej Singh with his brother Baldev Singh reached the place in the evening of that day. They saw Gian Kaur, lying dead on a charpai. They suspected foul play. Baltej Singh gave the information to the police narrating all the above events. He informed the police that his daughter was killed by Bhupinder Singh and his parents by administering something to her. On the basis of that information, the F.I.R. was issued. The investigation of the case was taken by A.S.I. (PW 4). The body of Gian Kaur was sent to Dr. Sant Prakash Singh (PW 6) for post mortem. The Doctor Prakash Singh noticed five minor injuries on the body of the deceased. The brain and other vital organs were also found to be congested. The Doctor sent stomach contents, portions of small intestine, liver, spleen and kidney to the chemical examiner for the purpose of analysis. The chemical examiner in his report dated September 14, 1983 has stated that an Organo phosphorus compound was found in the substance sent to him for analysis. The investigating officer sent that report for opinion of the Doctor Prakash Singh as to the cause of death of Gian Kaur. The Doctor gave his opinion that the death of Gian Kaur was due to organo phosphorus compound poisoning. Bhupinder Singh, his father Sher Singh and his mother Mukhtiar Kaur were tried for committing the murder of Gian kaur by administering poison. The prosecution examined six witnesses and the accused in turn examined one. The trial court after considering the evidence and other material on record held as follows: The accused had strong motive to get rid of Gian Kaur. Apparently motive for the murder was the inability of Gian Kaur to satisfy the demand for dowry. The death of Gian Kaur was not accidental or suicidal. There was no reason for her to commit suicide. It was also not a death by food poisoning since the accused and deceased shared common food on the fateful night. There was none else in the house on that night except Gian Kaur and the accused. The accused had an opportunity to accomplish their design. The accused must have administered the poison to the victim. The injuries found on the body of the deceased indicated the resistence she must have offered when the poison was administered to her. With these and other conclusions, the trial court finally said: 'In the background of the circumstances and evidence discussed above, the only conclusion possible is that Bhupinder Singh and Mukhtiar Kaur did administer poison organo phosphorus compound to Gian Kaur and did cause her death with common intention, which was to get rid of her as she had not been able to persuade his father to meet their demand for motorcycle so as to clear way for another marriage of Bhupinder Singh in his youthful years in order to get more and more of dowry.' Accordingly, the trial court found all the three accused guilty of the offence under Section 302 read with Section 34 I.P.C. They were sentenced to imprisonment for life. Challenging the legality of the conviction and sentence the accused appealed to the High Court. It was urged before the High Court that the death of Gian Kaur was not homicidal. She must have in all probability committed suicide since she was suffering from tuberculosis. It was also urged that the prosecution has failed to establish by evidence the necessary conditions for the proof of murder by poisoning. The High Court did not agree with those contentions. The High Court ruled out the theory of suicide. It was observed that there was no evidence to show that Gian Kaur was suffering from tuberculosis or ever treated for that disease. The High Court observed: 'Case of murder by poisoning is always one of secrecy. Almost in every such case one has to depend on circumstances. Doubtless, before a person can be convicted on the strength of circumstantial evidence, the circumstances in question must be satisfactorily established and the proved circumstances must bring home the offence to the accused beyond reasonable doubt. If those circumstances or some of them can be explained by any reasonable hypothesis then the accused must have the benefit of that hypothesis. But in assessing the evidence imaginary possibility has no place. What has to be considered are ordinary human probabilities. We have already referred to some important circumstances which in our opinion point out to the guilt of Bhupinder Singh and Sher Singh appellants. In the well known case of Anant Chantman Lagu vs The State of Bombay, ; their Lordships held that in a cause of poisoning, the prosecution must establish: (a) that the death took place by poisoning; (b) that the accused had the poison in his possession; and (c) that the accused had an opportunity to administer the poison to the deceased. All the three requirements are satisfied in this case. There is no dispute that the death of the deceased was caused by poisoning. It has been established by the chemical examiner's report, that the viscera contained organo phosphorus compound poison. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses has established that the aforesaid two appellants had the opportunity to administer poison to the deceased and that they had the motive to commit the crime. Their running away from the house at the time when the Investigating Officer visited their house is also consistent with their guilt and not with their innocence.' With these observations, the High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence on Sher Singh and Bhupinder Singh while acquitting Mukhtiar Kaur. The present appeal is only by Bhupinder Singh. Before embarking on the validity of the main submission made in this appeal, we may first dispose of one other contention urged for the appellant. Mr. R.N. Kohli, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that it is not enough for the chemical examiner merely to state in his report that the organo phosphorus compound was present in the substance sent to him for examination. He should have also stated that a lethal dose of the organo phosphorus compound was detected in the substance sent to him. His report should be full and complete to take the place of evidence which he would have given if he were called to Court as witness. In the absence of such particulars, the death by poisoning cannot be inferred. In support of this contention, learned counsel relied upon two decisions of the Allahabad High Court viz. (i) Mt. Gajrani and Anr. vs Emperor, [A.I.R. 1933 Allahabad 394] and (ii) State vs Fateh Bahadur & Ors., [A.I.R. 1958, Allahabad 1]. In the first case, it was observed that it was not enough for the chemical examiner merely to state his opinion. He must also state the grounds which formed the basis of his opinion. The second case was a case of death by arsenic poisoning. The chemical examiner did not state the quantity of arsenic poison found in the viscera of the deceased. He did not state whether it was a fatal dose or not. The High Court pointed out that it would be of the utmost importance before a Court could find any individual guilty of murder by arsenic poison that its complete analysis should be made. It is not enough to state that arsenic was detected in the body of the deceased. In our opinion, these observations cannot be taken as a rigid statement of law. (No hard and fast rule can be laid down as regards the value to be attached to the report of the chemical examiner. Section 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the report of scientific experts may be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceedings of the court. The chemical examiner does not, as a rule, give an opinion as to the cause of death but merely gives report of the chemical examination of the substance sent to him. The report by itself is not crucial. It is a piece of evidence. The only protection to it is that it does not require any formal proof. It is, however, open to the Court if it thinks fit to call the chemical examiner and examine him as to the subject matter of the report. The report should normally be forwarded to the Doctor who conducted the autopsy. In the instant case, that was done. The Doctor who conducted the autopsy was given a copy of the report of the chemical examiner. The Doctor in the light of the report gave his opinion that the death of Gian Kaur was by poisoning i.e. organo phosphorus compound. The report of the chemical examiner coupled with the opinion of the Doctor is, therefore, sufficient to hold that it was a death by poisoning. This takes us to the main contention urged for the appellant. It was urged that in a case of murder by poison there are three main points to be proved, firstly did the deceased die of the poison in question; secondly, had the accused got the poison in question in his or her possession; and thirdly, had the accused an opportunity to administer the poison in question to the deceased. It was also urged that if the prosecution fails to prove these factors, then the accused cannot be convicted. The evidence in the case, according to learned counsel falls short of these requirements and, in particular, as to the question of proof of possession of the poison with the accused and therefore the accused is entitled to acquittal. We have been referred to some decisions of this Court in support of the contention urged. We have also examined some other cases bearing on the question raised. A brief survey of these cases would be useful to appreciate the contention urged for the appellant. There are two unreported decisions of this Court of the year 1958. The first one is in Chandra Kant Myalchand Seth's case [Criminal Appeal No. 120 of 1957 decided on 19.2.1958]. There a woman died of alkali cyanide. The husband of the deceased was tried and convicted by the trial court for the offence of murder. The conviction was set aside by this Court. In the course of the judgment, it was observed: 'Before a person can be convicted of murder by poisoning, it is necessary to prove that the death of the deceased was caused by poison, that the poison in question was in possession of the accused and that poison was administered by the accused to the deceased.' The acquittal, however, was based on the consideration of the entire facts and circumstances of the case. It was found that there was a greater motive to the deceased to commit suicide than to the accused to commit murder. This Court also took note of the concern and conduct of the accused when he found his wife lying unconscious. The accused ran to the house of his friend and returned with a Doctor to render assistance to the victim. The accused called another Doctor for the same purpose. He was also found weeping all the while. Taking into consideration of all these factors, this Court found no justification to sustain the conviction of the accused. Dharambir Singh vs State of Punjab, (Criminal Appeal No. 98 of 1958 decided on 4.11.1958) is another case of homicidal action by cyanide poisoning. It was perhaps in this case, the guidelines as to the proof of certain facts in 'poison murder cases' were laid down by this Court. It was observed: 'Where the evidence is circumstantial the fact that the accused had motive to cause death of the deceased, though relevant, is not enough to dispense with the proof of certain facts which are essential to be proved in such cases, namely (firstly) did the deceased die of poison in question? (secondly) had the accused the poison in his possession? and (thirdly) had the accused an opportunity to administer the poison in question to the deceased? It is only when the motive is there and these facts are all proved that the court may be able to draw the inference, that the poison was administered by the accused to the deceased resulting in his death.' After laying down these principles, the court considered the entire evidence on record which indicated the likelihood of the deceased committing suicide or another person to have administered the poison to the deceased. This Court accordingly acquitted the accused by extending the benefit of doubt. If one prefers to go yet further back we find a decision of the Allahabad High Court which is exactly on the principles laid down in Dharambir Singh case. In Mt. Gajrani vs Emperor, A.I.R. 1933 All. 394 Benett, J. speaking for the Court observed (at p. 394): 'In a case of murder by poison there are three main points to be proved: firstly, did the deceased die of the poison in question; secondly, had the accused got the poison in question in his or her possession; and thirdly, had the accused an opportunity to administer the poison in question to the deceased. If these three points are proved, a presumption may under certain circumstances be drawn by the Court that the accused did administer poison to the deceased and did cause the death of the deceased. It is not usual that reliable direct evidence is available to prove that the accused did actually administer poison to the deceased. The evidence of motive which is frequently given in these cases is of subsidiary importance, and the mere fact that the accused had a motive to cause the death of the deceased is not a fact which will dispense with the proof of the second and third points that the accused had the poison in his or her possession, and that the accused had an opportunity to administer the poison.' The above proposition found its way into Mohan vs State of Uttar Pradesh, ; and Ram Gopal vs State of Maharashtra, A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 656. In Mohan's case, the death in question was by arsenic poisoning. In that case, the prosecution was able to prove that the accused gave 'peras' to the victim as 'pershad' and the victim died after eating the 'pershad'. 'Pershad' contained arsenic. There was thus direct evidence as to the possession of the poison with the accused. This Court, therefore, had no difficulty to sustain the conviction and sentence awarded to the accused. Ram Gopal's case was concerned with homicidal action by administering a compound called 'kerosene and orango choloro compound'. The High Court, relying upon the motive and other circumstantial evidence convicted the accused for the offence of murder although there was no evidence that the accused was in possession of poison. This Court could not agree with the view taken by the High Court. The analysis of the evidence produced by the prosecution revealed that the motive alleged against the accused was not fully established. The incriminating circumstantial evidence against the accused was also found to be insufficient. So the conviction of the accused was set aside and the acquittal was recorded. Sharda E. Chand Sarda vs State of Maharashtra, ; is yet another case of death by cyanide poisoning for which the husband of the deceased was tried for murder. There was no direct evidence to establish that the accused was in possession of that poison. The High Court, however, relied upon the circumstantial evidence and convicted the accused. In the appeal preferred by the accused, this Court did not agree with the reasoning of the High Court. After referring to Ram Gopal's case. Fazal Ali, J., focussed the attention on the following four factors: The learned Judge observed (at p.167): 'So far as this matter is concerned, in such cases the court must carefully scan the evidence and determine the four important circumstances which alone can justify a conviction: (1) there is a clear motive for an accused to administer poison to the deceased, (2) that the deceased died of poison said to have been administered, (3) that the accused had the poison in his possession, (4) that he had an opportunity to administer the poison to the deceased.' The learned Judge went on to state: 'In the instant case, while two ingredients have been proved but two have not. In the first place, it has no doubt been proved that Manju died of potassium cyanide and secondly, it has also been proved that there was an opportunity to administer the poison. It has, however, not been proved by any evidence that the appellant had the poison in his possession. On the other hand, as indicated above, there is clear evidence of PW 2 that potassium cyanide could have been available to Manju from the plastic factory of her mother, but there is no evidence to show that the accused could have procured potassium cyanide from any available source. We might here extract a most unintelligible and extra ordinary finding of the High Court: "It is true that there is no direct evidence on these two points, because the prosecution is not able to lead evidence that the accused had secured potassium cyanide poison from a particular source. Similarly there is no direct evidence to prove that he had administered poison to Manju. However, it is not necessary to prove each and every fact by a direct evidence. Circumstantial evidence can be a basis for proving this fact." The comment by the high Court appears to be frightfully vague and absolutely unintelligible. While holding in the clearest possible terms that there is no evidence in this case to show that the appellant was in possession of poison, the High Court observes that this fact may prove either by direct or indirect (circumstantial) evidence. But it fails to indicate the nature of the circumstantial or indirect evidence to show that the appellant was in possession of poison. If the Court seems to suggest that merely because the appellant had the opportunity to administer poison had the same was found in the body of the deceased, it should be presumed that the appellant was in possession of poison, then it has committed a serious and gross error of law and has blatantly violated the principles laid down by this Court. The High Court has not indicated as to what was the basis for coming to a finding that the accused could have procured the cyanide. On the other hand, in view of the decision in Ram Gopal's case failure to prove possession of the cyanide poison with the accused by itself would result in failure of the prosecution to prove its case.' This Court then went into the merits of the prosecution case. It was observed that the deceased was of sensitive mind. She had occasionally suffered mental depression due to her inability to adjust herself to her husband's family. It was also observed that the deceased had access to the poison in question. She could have secured the poison from the factory of her mother. Considering these and other circumstances, it was held 'that it might be a case of suicide or murder and both were equally probable'. So the accused was given the benefit of doubt and he was acquitted. From the foregoing cases, it will be seen that in poison murder cases, the accused was not acquitted solely on the failure of the prosecution to establish one or other requirement which this Court has laid down in Dharambir Singh case. We do not also find any case where the accused was acquitted solely on the ground that the prosecution has failed to prove that the accused had the poison in his possession. The accused in all the said cases came to be acquitted by taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances including insufficient motive, weakness in the chain of circumstantial evidence and likelihood of the deceased committing suicide. We do not consider that there should be acquittal on the failure of the prosecution to prove the possession of poison with the accused. Murder by poison is invariably committed under the cover and cloak of secrecy. Nobody will administer poison to another in the presence of others. The person who administers poison to another in secrecy will not keep a portion of it for the investigating officer to come and collect it. The person who commits such murder would naturally take care to eliminate and destroy the evidence against him. In such cases, it would be impossible for the prosecution to prove possession of poison with the accused. The prosecution may, however, establish other circumstances consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. The court then would not be justified in acquitting the accused on the ground that the postmortem has failed to prove possession of the poison with the accused. The poison murder cases are not to be put outside the rule of circumstantial evidence. There may be obvious very many facts and circumstances out of which the Court may be justified in drawing permissible inference that the accused was in possession of the poison in question. There may be very many facts and circumstances proved against the accused which may call for tacit assumption of the factum of possession of poison with the accused. The insistence on proof of possession of poison with the accused invariably in every case is neither desirable nor practicable. It would mean to introduce an extraneous ingredient to the offence of murder by poisoning. We cannot, therefore, accept the contention urged by the learned counsel for the appellant. The accused in a case of murder by poisoning cannot have a better chance of being exempted from sanctions than in otherKinds of murders. Murder by poisoning is run like any other murder. In cases where dependence is wholly on circumstantial evidence, and direct evidence not being available, the Court can legitimately draw from the circumstances an inference on any matter one way or the other. The view that we have taken gets support from the decision of this Court in Ananth Chintaman Laguy vs The State of Bombay, ; where Hidayatullah, J., has given an anxious consideration to the three propositions laid down in Dharambir Singh case. The learned Judge did not consider them as invariable criteria of proof to be established by the prosecution in every case of murder by poisoning. The learned Judge said (at p. 519 520): 'It is now necessary to consider the arguments which have been advanced on behalf of the appellant. The first contention is that the essential ingredients required to be proved in all cases of murder by poisoning were not proved by the prosecution in this case. Reference in this connection is made to a decision of the Allahabad High Court in Mt. Gajrani vs Emperor. AIR 1933 All 394 and to two unreported decisions of this Court in Chandrakant N Nyalchand Seth vs The State of Bombay, Criminal Appeal No. 120 of 1957 decided on February 19, 1958 and Dharambir Singh vs The State of Punjab, Criminal Appeal No. 98 of 1958, decided on 4.11.1958. In these cases, the Court referred to three propositions which the prosecution must establish in a case of poisoning; (a) that death took place by poisoning; (b) that the accused had the poison in his possession, and (c) that the accused had an opportunity to administer the poison to the deceased. The case in Cr. A. No. 98 of 1958 D/ 4.11.1958 (SC) turned upon these three propositions. There, the deceased had died as a result of poisoning by potassium cyanide, which poison was also found in the autopsy. The High Court had disbelieved the evidence which sought to establish that the accused had obtained potassium cyanide, but held, nevertheless that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to convict the accused in that case. This Court, did not, however, accept the circumstantial evidence as complete. It is to be observed that the three propositions were laid down not as the invariable criteria of proof by direct evidence in a case of murder by poisoning, because evidently if after poisoning the victim. the accused destroyed all traces of the body, the first proposition would be incapable of being proved except by circumstantial evidence. Similarly, if the accused gave a victim something to eat and the victim died immediately on the ingestion of that food with symptoms of poisoning and poison, in fact, was found in the viscera, the requirement of proving that the accused was possessed of the poison would follow from the circumstances that the accused gave the victim something to eat and need not be separately proved.' The learned Judge continued: 'The cases of this Court which were decided proceeded upon their own facts, and though the three propositions must be kept in mind always, the sufficiency of the evidence, direct or circumstantial? to establish murder by poisoning will depend on the facts of each case. If the evidence in a particular case does not justify the inference that death is the result of poisoning because of the failure of the prosecution to prove the fact satisfactorily, either directly or by circumstantial evidence, then the benefit of the doubt will have to be given to the accused person. But if circumstantial evidence, in the absence of direct proof of the three elements, is so decisive that the Court can unhesitatingly hold that the death was a result of administration of poison (though not detected) and that the poison must have been administered by the accused person, then the conviction can be rested on it.' So much for the principles for which the learned counsel for the appellant fought for. On the facts there is concurrence of opinion between the two courts below. This Court seldom re examines the findings of fact reached by the High Court. We may, however, out of deference to the counsel briefly refer to the evidence. The prosecution has established the motive for the murder. The proof of motive goes a long way to tilt the scale against the accused which provides a foundational material to connect the chain of circumstances. The facts which hear on motive are distressing. After the marriage, Gian Kaur was subjected to repeated harassment for not satisfying the demand for dowry made by Bhupinder Singh. Baltej Singh (PW2) has stated that Bhupinder Singh asked Gian Kaur to bring Rs. 10,000. The parents of Bhupinder Singh were also parties to that demand. Baltej Singh with all difficulties satisfied that demand in part by payment of Rs.6,000. Bhupinder Singh thereafter demanded a motorcycle. When that was not immediately given Bhupinder Singh held out a threat to his wife that she would be killed. This was conveyed to Baltej Singh. Before he could take a decision in this regard he was shocked to receive the news of death of Gian Kaur. This has been proved by the testimony of Baltej Singh (PW 2) and Nazir Singh (PW 3). The demand for dowry followed by harassment to the deceased has been thus satisfactorily proved. The evidence of the Doctor and the report of the chemical examiner has established beyond doubt that Gian Kaur died of organo phosphorus compound poisoning. Bhupinder Singh had an opportunity to administer that poison. There was nobody else in the house. All the inmates had their common food in the night. All of them slept in the same place. Both the Courts have ruled out the theory of suicide by Gian Kaur. We entirely agree with that finding. She could not have thrown her child to the mercy of others by committing suicide and indeed no mother would venture to do that. The postmortem report giving the description of injuries found on the body of the deceased would also defy all doubts about the theory of suicide. She had contusion on the front of right leg. Abrasion on the front of the left leg just below the knee joint. Linear abrasion on the back of right hand. Linear abrasion on the antro lateral aspect of left fore arm in its middle. And contusion on the back of right elbow joint. These injuries, as the Courts below have observed could have been caused while Gian Kaur resisted the poison being administered to her. The behaviour of Bhupinder Singh in the early hours of that fateful day by going to his field as if nothing had happened to his wife is apparently inconsistent with the normal human behaviour. There was no attempt made by him or other inmates of the house to look out for any Doctor to give medical attention to the victim. The movement and disposition of Bhupinder Singh towards the victim and situations are incompatible with his innocence. On the contrary, it gives sustenance to his guilt. The Courts below having considered all these facts and circumstances had no difficulty to convict the accused for murder and we see no good reason to interfere with that conclusion. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. R.S.S. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 10085 of 1983. From the Judgment and Order dated 15.9.1982 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Revision No. 332 of 1981. S.N. Kacker and R.B. Mahlotra for the Appellant. Aruneshwar Gupta and B.B. Sharma for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VARADARAJAN, J. The short point arising for consideration in this appeal by special leave filed against the decision of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Revision No. 332 of 1981 turns upon the interpretation of section 20 (4) of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act 13 of 1972 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act '). The appellant land lady filed the suit on 6.8.1973 for recovering possession from the respondent tenant of a portion of premises situate at Bhau Ka Nagla, Agra Road, Mauza Dholpura on the allegation that it had been let to the respondent on a rent of Rs. 360 per mensem and that the tenancy has come to an end by efflux of time fixed in the rent note on the expiry of 30.6.1973. She alleged in the plaint that the demised property is situate beyond the municipal limits of Ferozabad and is intended for use as a factory and is exempt from the provision of the Act and that the respondent is in arrears of rent to the extent of Rs. 3,960 for the period from 1.8.1972 to 30.6.1973 and she is entitled to recover possession of the premises together with arrears of rent of Rs. 3,960 at Rs. 360 per mensem for the said period and mesne profits at Rs. 720 for the subsequent period from 1.7.1973 at Rs. 20 per day. The respondent opposed the suit contending that the property is situate within three kilometres of Ferozabad municipal limits and was not a factory when it was let out and that it is governed by the 586 provisions of the Act. He denied that the rent is Rs. 360 per mensem and contended that it is only Rs. 125 per mensem and that the tenancy includes a vacant land shaded green and yellow in the plan filed with the plaint which according to the plaint does not form part of the lease. He denied that he had executed the rent note mentioned in the plaint and that the vacant land shaded green and yellow in the plaint plan had not been leased to him. He further denied that the tenancy has come to an end by efflux of time and contended that the amounts claimed as arrears of rent and mesne profits are wrong and excessive and that the notice to quit is invalid in law as it excludes the vacant land shaded green and yellow in the plaint plan which also is the subject matter of the lease. Finally he contended that the suit is barred by the provisions of s.20 of the Act sub section (1) whereof says that save as provided in sub section (2), no suit shall be instituted for the eviction of a tenant from a building notwithstanding the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time or on the expiration of a notice to quit or in any other manner. The learned Fourth Additional District Judge, Agra who tried the suit exercising his Jurisdiction as a Judge of Small Causes Court found on 19.7.1975 that he had jurisdiction while recording findings on the point of jurisdiction tried as preliminary issue, and he held that though admittedly even the vacant land marked green and yellow in the plaint plan had been originally leased upto 27.7.1972 thereafter only the red marked portion had been leased on a rent of Rs. 360 per mensem under the rent note (paper No. 18A) the execution whereof has been denied by the respondent, excluding the green and yellow marked portion. On the basis of that unregistered rent note, (paper No. 18A) he found that the rent is Rs. 360 per mensem, rejecting the respondent 's case that the old rent of Rs. 125 per mensem continued even after the dissolution of the partnership to which the premises had been leased earlier. The respondent admitted that though the property is situate outside the Ferozabad municipal limits it is situate within three kilo metres from those limits and is therefore governed by the provisions of the Act while the appellant denied that it is situate within three kilo metres. The learned District Judge found on the evidence that the property is situate within two kilo metres of the municipal limits and falls within the exception and is governed by the provisions of the Act. He found that the tenancy for the period of 11 months under the rent note (paper No. 18A) had come to an end by efflux of 587 time and the parties are governed by it and that the suit is, however, governed by the provisions of s.20 of the Act. However, the learned District Judge considered the question whether the respondent is liable for eviction in this suit and found that the appellant had served notice of demand (paper No. 35C) on the respondent and he failed to pay the rent claimed by the appellant and he is as such liable to be evicted under s.20 of the Act. But the respondent had deposited the full amount of rent as claimed at Rs. 360 per mensem together with damages for use and occupation, interest and costs as required by s.20 (4) of the Act on 31.10.1973, a day after the first hearing date 30.10.1973. The learned District Judge found that the sum of Rs. 7,490 was tendered in court on 30.10.1973 and passed by the court on that day and deposited into the bank on 31.10.1973 and that the tender made on 30.10.1973 was valid and the payment must be deemed to have been made on 30.10.1973 itself. But he accepted the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that because the respondent had contended in the written statement that the rent is Rs. 125 per mensem and it was rejected by the court and it was found that the rent is Rs. 360 per mensem the deposit of Rs. 7,490 towards arrears of rent calculated at Rs. 360 per mensem together with interest and costs was not unconditional and therefore invalid and s.20 (4) of the Act does not help the respondent. In that view the learned District Judge decreed the suit for eviction with arrears of rent and mesne profits at Rs. 360 per mensem from 1.8.1972 and ordered credit being given for the amount deposited by the respondent towards the amount payable under the decree and granted four months time for the respondent to vacate the premises. In C.R.P. No. 332 of 1981 filed by the respondent against the Judgment of the trial court a Division Bench of the High Court noticed that one of the conditions of s.20(4) of the Act is that the tenant should unconditionally pay or deposit the entire amount due together with interest and costs and that s.20 (6) says that any amount deposited under s.20(4) shall be paid to the landlord without prejudice to the pleadings of the parties and subject to the ultimate decision in the suit, and they have observed that the submission made before them on behalf of the appellant that the deposit to be unconditional must be on acknowledgement of the liability for rent as claimed by the landlord if accepted would render the provisions in s.20(6) of the Act nugatory. They have observed that if the tenant makes a deposit 588 with a condition that it shall not be paid to the landlord until the suit is decided it would be a conditional deposit. They have found that in the present case the deposit was not conditional merely because while depositing the amount inclusive of rent at the rate of Rs. 360 per mensem as claimed in the plaint the respondent had contended in the written statement that the rent is Rs. 125 per mensem and not Rs. 360 per mensem and that pleading in the written statement that the rent is Rs. 125 per mensem and not Rs. 360 per mensem does not make the deposit conditional. In that view the learned Judges allowed the civil revision petition and dismissed the suit with costs in both the courts. The findings dated 19.7.1975 recorded by the learned District Judge on the preliminary issue holding that he had jurisdiction to entertain the suit is not available in the records produced in this Court. Therefore, it is not known for what reason the learned District Judge held that he had jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The appellant came forward with the suit for recovering possession of the premises together with arrears of rent and mesne profits on the allegation that the tenancy under the rent note (paper No. 18A) was for a period of only 11 months and that it had come to an end by efflux of time and the premises was intended for use as a factory and the Act is not applicable thereto. On the other hand, the respondent 's defence was that the property was situate within three kilo metres of Ferozabad municipal limits and is governed by the provisions of the Act and that the civil suit for recovery of possession of the property is not maintainable. The learned District Judge accepted the respondent 's contention on the question of applicability of the provisions of the Act to the premises in question on the ground that it is located within two kilo metres of Ferozabad municipal limits. section 20(1) of the Act lays down that save as provided in sub section (2), no suit shall be instituted for eviction of a tenant from a building, notwithstanding the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time or on the expiry of a notice to quite or in any other manner. The present suit is not based on any of the grounds mentioned in s.20 (2) of the Act and though the respondent is alleged to have been in arrears of rent to the extent of Rs. 3, 960/ there is no allegation in the plaint that he is in arrears of rent for not less than four months and had failed to pay the same to the appellant within one month from the date of service upon him of a notice of demand, which is the ground mentioned in clause (a) of s.20(2) of the Act. In these 589 circumstances, the learned District Judge should have normally dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction in view of s.20(1) of the Act on his finding that the Act is applicable to the premises. It is not known why he did not do so, but on the other hand proceeded to hold that the deposit by the respondent is not unconditional as required by s.20(4) of the Act and ordered his eviction on that basis. We entirely agree with the learned Judges of the High Court that the deposit of the amount on the first hearing date, made up of rent at the rate of Rs. 360 per mensem as claimed in the plaint and interest and costs could not be said to be not unconditional merely because the respondent had contended in the written statement that the rent was only Rs. 125 per mensem and he did not succeed in proving it at the trial. It is not possible to construe s.20(4) in the manner done by the learned District Judge as that would amount to foreclosure of any defence regarding the quantum of rent even in cases where the amount alleged by the landlord is more than the real rent agreed between the parties. In this connection Mr. Kacker, learned Counsel appearing for appellant relied strongly upon the following observation made by Balakrishna Eradi, J, speaking for himself and Pathak and Venkataramiah, JJ. in Mangal Sen vs Kanchhid Mal : 'The provisions of sub section (4) will be attracted only if the tenant has, at the first hearing of the suit, unconditionally paid or tendered to the landlord the entire amount of rent and damages for use and occupation of the building due from him together with interest thereon at the rate of nine per cent per annum and the landlord 's costs of the suit in respect thereof, after deducting therefrom any amount already deposited by him under sub section (1) of section 30. There is absolutely no material available on the record to show that the alleged deposit of Rs. 1,980 was made by the tenant on the first date of hearing itself and, what is more important, that the said deposit was made by way of an unconditional tender for payment to the landlord. The deposit in question is said to have been made by the appellant on January 25, 1974. It was only subsequent thereto 590 that the appellant filed his written statement in the suit. It is noteworthy that one of the principal contentions raised by the appellant defendant in the written statement was that since he had stood surety for the landlord for arrears of sales tax, there was no default by him in the payment or rent. In the face of the said plea taken in the written statement, disputing, the existence of any arrears of rent and denying that there had been a default, it is clear that the deposit, even it was made on the date of the first hearing, was not an unconditional tender of the amount for payment to the landlord. Further, there is also nothing on record to show that what was deposited was the correct amount calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 20(4). In these circumstances, we hold that the appellant has failed to establish that he has complied with the conditions specified in sub section (4) of Section 20 and hence he is not entitled to be relieved against his liability for eviction on the ground set out in clause (a) of sub section (2) of the said Section.' The above principle cannot apply to the facts of the present case, for in that case it was not clear whether the deposit of the correct amount was made within the time fixed in s.20(4) of the Act whereas in the present case it has been found by the learned District Judge that the arrears of rent at the rate claimed in the plaint together with interest and costs had been deposited within the time mentioned in section 20 (4) of the Act. Mr. Kacker next drew our attention to the language used in s.20(4) and s.39 of the Act and submitted that whereas the provisions of s.39 are mandatory the Rent Controller has a discretion in s.20(4) in lieu of passing a decree for eviction on the ground of failure to deposit the arrears, interest and costs within the period mentioned in s.20(4) to pass an order relieving the tenant against his liability for eviction on that ground and that the High Court exercising revisional jurisdiction under section 115 C.P.C. should not have interfered with the discretion exercised by the learned District Judge in ordering eviction and set aside that order especially in view of the fact that the respondent had failed to prove that the rent was only Rs. 125 per mensem and not Rs. 360 per mensem. We do not agree. The Act is a social piece of legislation which leans in favour of tenants. Merely because 591 the tenant had failed to prove his case that the rent was only Rs. 125 per mensem and not Rs. 360 per mensem, the discretionary relief could not be denied to him even though he had deposited the arrears of rent at the rate claimed by the landlord in the plaint together with interest and costs within the time mentioned in s.20(4) of the Act. It is not possible to lay down any broad and general proposition that the discretionary relief should be denied to the tenant in all cases where he fails to prove his case regarding the quantum rent even though he had deposited the rent at the rate claimed by the landlord in the plaint together with interest and costs within the time as required by s.20(4) of the Act. For the reasons mentioned above we are of the opinion that no interference with the decision of the High Court is called for in this case. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. N.V.K. Appeal dismissed. By virtue of Entry 36 of the First Schedule in the 'footwear and parts thereof' in or on relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power, is chargeable to excise duty, the rate of duty being 10% ad valorem in respect of 'footwear' and 15% ad valorem in respect of 'parts of footwear'. By a Notification dated July 24, 1967, issued In exercise of the powers conferred by sub rule (1) of rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, the Central Government exempted, with effect from the 26th May, 1967, footwear falling under item No. 36 of the First Schedule to the , of which the value did not exceed Rs. 5 per pair from the whole of the duty of excise leviable thereon. During the year 1967 and 1968, Bata Shoe Company was manufacturing certain items of footwear of which the wholesale price was Rs. 6.25 per pair. The contention of the company that since the assessable value of such items of footwear calculated in terms of section 4 of the Act, as it stood at the relevant time was only Rs. 4.94 and thus less than Rs. 5 per pair were qualified for exemption under the Notification was negatived by the department on the ground that while computing the value of the articles for the purpose of judging the applicability of the exemption, the duty element of the cost structure could not be deducted from the wholesale price and on such calculation the value of such footwear would exceed Rs. 5 per pair. Three Writ Petitions were, therefore, filed in the High Courts of Patna, Calcutta and the Punjab & Haryana, since the company had three manufacturing establishments attracting the jurisdictions of these Courts. The Patna High Court allowed the writ petition accepting the contention of the company and granted certificate of appeal to the department. The High Court of Calcutta 961 dismissed the petition and accepted the stand of the Department that the expression 'value' occurring in the Notification dated July 24,1967 is not the deemed 'value' calculated according to the provisions of section 4 of the Act, but is the real and actual 'value' of the goods after the payment of the duty. The High Court of Punjab & Haryana dismissed the petition in limini on the ground of laches. Both these two High Courts, however, granted certificate of appeal to the company. Hence the three appeals by certificates. Allowing the appeals of the company and dismissing the State appeal, he Court, ^ HELD 1.1 While computing the 'value' of the articles of footwear for the purposes of testing the availability of the exemption granted under the Notification dated July 24,1967 section 4 of the gets attracted. Section 4 is comprehensive in its coverage and it lays down the procedure to be followed for determination of 'value' of any article in every case where the article is chargeable with duty at a rate dependent on the value of the article. [966H, 967A] 1.2 While the notification makes it clear that the effect of the Notification is to render the changeability or otherwise to duty of excise of footwear falling under item 36 of the First Schedule is made wholly dependent upon the 'value' of the article of footwear; in case such 'value' exceeds Rs. 5 per pair, duty will be chargeable at the rate of 10%. whereas if the value does not exceed Rs.5 per pair, no duty will be chargeable on such items of footwear, that is the rate of duty will be nil. Thus entry 36 read along with the Notification dated July 24, 1967 clearly shows that the changeability to duty in respect of any article of footwear is made dependent upon its value in tho sense that the chargeability to duty of excise will arise only if the 'value' of the article does not exceed Rs. 5 per pair. [966D E, 967A B] 1.3 Before determining the question of availability of the exemption under the Notification dated July 24, 1967, the first essential step, therefore, is to determine the 'value' of the article in the manner prescribed in section 4 of the Act. The fact that on such a computation the article may ultimately be found to be exempted from excise duty does not have any bearing on the question of applicability of section 4 of the Act for determining the ' 'value' for purpose of duty. [967B D] 1.4 The expression 'I`or the purpose of duty' occurring in section 4 has a wide import. For all purposes connected with the determination of chargeability and levy of duty the provisions of the section are to be applied for computation of the 'value' of the article. Under the Explanation to section 4, it is mandatory that in determining the price of an article both trade discount as well as the amount of duty calculated as payable on the wholesale cash price payable at the time of removal of the article based on the wholesale cash price referred to in clause (a) are to be deducted from such wholesale price. [967D E] In the instant case, in as much as the value of the articles of footwear in 962 question calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Act did note exceed Rs.5 per pair, the articles in question were exempted from the charge to duty of excise under the Notification dated July 24, 1967 and the company is entitled, forthwith, to a refund of the amounts of duty illegally realised by the Department. [967G H] The Collector of Central Excise, Patna & Ors. vs The Bata Shoe Company (P) Ltd. AIR Patna approved. The Bata Shoe Company (P) Ltd. vs The Collector of Central Excise & Ors., Calcutta, AIR Calcutta : The Bata Shoe Company (P) Ltd. vs The Collector of Central Excise & Ors., AIR Pun jab & Haryana reversed.

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 208 of 1973. From the Judgment and order dated the 25th September, 1973 of the Patna High Court in Election Petition No. 4 of 1972. K. K. Prasad, K. K. Sinha and section K. Sinha for the appellant. K. P. Varma, D. P. Mukherjee and D. Goburdhan for respondent No. 1. U. section Prasad for respondent No. 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA, J. Election from 168 Katoria Bihar Legislative Assembly Constituency took place in March, 1972. The poll was held on March 11, 1972 and the votes were counted on March 12, 1972. Respondent No. 1 herein, an independent candidate, was declared elected having secured 16649 votes as against 16074 polled by the appellant, a nominee of Indian National Congress (R). There were three other candidates (Respondents 2 to 4) who secured 2347, 8001 & 1542 votes respectively. The votes rejected as invalid, were 1219. On April 14, 1972, the appellant filed an election petition under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 challenging the election of the returned candidate on the ground that several irregularities and illegalities were committed in the counting of votes. The petition was resisted by the returned candidate. The High Court framed issues, recorded the evidence produced by the parties and held that the allegations had not been substantiated. It declined the request for a recount and dismissed the petition. Hence this appeal by the petitioner. Mr. Prasad, learned Counsel for the appellant contends that the following irregularities/illegalities in the counting had been established: (1) Four unauthorised persons, viz., Ajudhya Prasad Singh, Q. M. Zaman, Parvez Ahmed and Radhey Sham Sah were allowed to work as Counting Supervisors at tables 4, 5, 7 and 9 in breach of the rules, and this had vitiated the counting. (2) In the first round of counting at table No. 4 in the box relating to polling station No. 74, Madhopur U.P. School, 50 unsigned ballot papers were found in excess of those actually polled. When this was detected and brought to the notice of the Assistant Returning officer, he, in violation of Rule 93(1) of the Conduct of Election Rules (for short, called the Rules) and to cover up the irregularity, opened that packet and inspected those unused ballot papers. (3) The detailed result sheet which was inter alia prepared tablewise, in accordance with the instructions of the Election Commission, has been deliberately suppressed to prevent detection of mistakes and manipulations made in the counting. (4) About 600-700 uncounted ballot papers in bundles were kept below his table by the Assistant Returning Officer. In the final round of counting, despite protest, 600 votes were counted twice, in favour of Respondent No. 1. That was why the petitioner who at the end of the third round was leading by a margin of 2205 votes, was shown having lost by 575 votes to Respondent No. 1, notwithstanding the fact that in the last round there were only 3800 ballot papers to be counted. Before dealing with these contentions, we may recall, what this Court has repeatedly said, that an order for inspection and recount of the ballot papers cannot be made as a matter of course. The reason is two-fold. Firstly such an order affects the secrecy of the ballot which under the law is not to be lightly disturbed. Secondly, the Rules provide an elaborate procedure for counting of ballot papers. This procedure contains so many statutory checks and effective safeguards against trickery mistakes and fraud in counting, that it can be called almost fool proof. Although no hard and fast rule can be laid down, yet the broad guidelines, as discernible from the decisions of this Court, may be indicated thus: The Court would be justified in ordering a recount of the ballot papers, only where: (1) the election petition contains an adequate statement of all the material facts on which the allegations of irregularity or illegality in counting are founded; (2). On the basis of evidence adduced such allegations are prima facie established, affording a good ground for believing that there has been a mistake in counting and (3) the Court trying the petition is prima facie satisfied that the making of such an order is imperatively necessary to decide the dispute and to do complete and effectual justice between the parties. The contentions advanced in this case are to be tested in the light of these principles. Since, on the whole, we agree with the findings and the conclusion of the court below, we will confine the discussion to the broad features timeline of key events in the case?",

Thakkar and section section Khanduja for the Appellant. B.V. Patel, section P. Nayar and M. N. Shroff for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the; Gujarat High Court dated February 17, 1977 in Special Criminal Application No. 1 of 1977 filed under Articles 140 226 and 227 of the Constitution whereby the High Court reversed the order of the learned Sessions Judge, Broach in Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 1975 and sent the matter back to the learned Sessions Judge for passing an appropriate order in regard to the question as to whether the entire seized stock of exercise books of the appellant or part thereof should be confiscated under section 6A of the . The question raised in the appeal is whether exercise books are covered by the item 'paper' occurring in section 2(a) (vii) of that Act as also in Entry 13 of Schedule I to the Gujarat Essential Articles Dealers ' (Regulation) order, 1971 ? The question arises in these circumstances: The appellant Maharaja Book Depot is a partnership firm dealing in books and stationery articles at Rajpipla, District Broach. Its shop was inspected and searched by the Mamlatdar of Rajpipla on July 4, 1975 when certain alleged irregularities came to light. During the search 78 gross exercise books of controlled variety and 97 gross exercise books of non controled variety were seized on the ground that the appellant had committed breaches of Clauses 3, 9 and 11 of the Gujarat Essential Articles Dealers ' (Regulation) order 1971 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation order'), in that the appellant (a) did not display at any conspicuous part of the premises the opening stock of the exercise books, (b) did not write the names of the customers on the bills issued to them for the sale of the exercise books and (c) did not keep a register showing the stock of controlled and non controlled exercise books. A notice under section 6B of the (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act ') was served by the Collector, Broach, calling upon the appellant to show cause why the seized stock of exercise books should not be confiscated and after taking into consideration the explanation offered by the appellant the Collector by his order dated September 17, 1975 held that the appellant firm was guilty of the breaches of Clauses 3, 9 and 11 of the, Regulation order and directed that the entire seized stock be confiscated to the State Government under section 6A of the Act. The appellant preferred an appeal to the Sessions Court at Broach being Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 1975 and the learned Sessions Judge by his judgment and order dated October 16, 1976 allowed the appeal and set aside the order of confiscation on the ground that the Act and the Regulation order did not apply to the exercise books inasmuch as an exercise book which is a distinct commodity did not fall within the item 'paper' enlisted as an essential commodity in section 2(a) (vii) of the Act and in Entry 13 of Schedule I to the Regulation order. This order was challenged by the State of Gujarat in Special Criminal Application No. 1 of 1977 under article 227 of the Constitution. The High Court by its judgment and order dated February 17, 1977 took the view that the 141 item 'paper' as enlisted both in section 2(i) (vii) of the Act and Entry 13 A in Schedule I to the Regulation order was wide enough to cover an exercise book which was nothing but collection of papers stitched together by a piece of string or pinned with pins of stappler and quashed the order of the learned Sessions Judge but instead of straightaway confirming the Collector 's confiscation order it remanded the appeal back to the Sessions Judge for passing an appropriate order after deciding the question as to whether the entire seized stock or a part thereof should be confiscated under section 6A of the Act. The appellant has challenged the legality and or validity of the view taken by the High Court in this appeal. In order to appreciate properly the submissions of counsel for the appellant on the construction of the expression 'paper' occurring in the concerned legislations it will be necessary to set out the purpose and the relevant provisions thereof. The Act was put on the Statute Book, as its preamble will show, with a view to provide, in the interests of the general public, for the, control of production, supply and distribution of, and trade and commerce in certain commodities defined and enlisted as 'essential commodities' in section 2, which enlistment has been enlarged from time to time by Central Government Notifications. In other words, the obvious purpose of the enactment is to control the production, supply and distribution of certain commodities which are essential for the society at large with a view to ensure that the common man gets them at fair prices without let or hindrance on the part of the trade. Section 3 confers powers on the Central Government to regulate or prohibit the production,, supply and distribution of essential commodities and trade and commerce therein by issuance of orders in that behalf for maintaining or increasing supplies of such commodities or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices etc. while under section 5 the Central Government can delegate its powers in that behalf to an officer or authority subordinate to it or to any State Government. It appears that on December 8, 1971 in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) read with cls. (d), (e), (i) and (j) of sub section (2) of section 3 of the Act read with the order of the Government of India, Ministry of Commerce No. so 1844 dated June 18, 1966, and the order of that Government in the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Community Development and Co operation (Department of Food) No. G.S.R. 1111 dated July 24, 1971, the State of Gujarat passed its order called 'The Gujarat Essential Articles Dealers (Regulation) order, 1971', for the purpose of maintaining supplies of essential articles and for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices. Now, the Act as also the Regulation Order contain an enlistment of items which are regarded as 'essential commodities ' or '. essential articles '; section 2(a) of the 142 Act defines 'essential commodity ' as meaning any of the classes of commodities enlisted in its various sub clauses and sub cl. (vii) refers to the item 'paper' while cl. (v) of the Regulation order defines 'essential article ' as meaning any of the articles specified in Schedule I and item 13 in that Schedule relates to 'paper' but at both the places the item has been described in identical manner, viz: 'Paper, including newsprint, paper board and strawboard'. It seems that the enlistment of the item 'paper' in the above manner in section 2(a) (vii) of the Act has not been amended, altered or changed but its enlistment in the Regulation order has undergone a change, for by a Notification dated July 10, 1975, the Schedule I of the Regulation order was recast and more items were added. Schedule I so amended by the said Notification now includes the item 'paper' at sl. No. 14 which runs thus: '14. Paper' including news print, paper board, straw board and exercise note books. ' In other words, by the Notification dated July 10, 1975 exercise note books have come to be specifically added to the item 'paper'. The main question is whether exercise books are covered by the item 'paper' as described in section 2 (a) (vii) of the Act and in Item 13 in Schedule I to the Regulation order as it stood before its amendment by the Notification dated July 10, 1975. Counsel for the appellant raised two or three contentions before us in support of this appeal. He emphasized the fact that on July 4. 1975 when the stock of exercise books was seized from the appellant 's shop by the Mamlatdar both in section 2(a) (vii) of the Act as well as under Entry 13 in Schedule I to the Regulation order the item 'paper' as an essential commodity was described in a particular manner without the addition of 'exercise note books' which was made in the Regulation order after the seizure had been effected. On construction of the item 'paper' he first contended that the expression 'paper' ordinarily means a sheet or sheets of paper and an exercise book being a distinct commodity was excluded from that item. Secondly, he urged that this would be. so because even while providing for an inclusive description of the item the legislation has included only news prints, paper boards and straw boards within it but not exercise books and, therefore, the expression 'paper' should be construed as excluding exercise books. Thirdly, he urged that so far as the Gujarat Regulation order is concerned the very fact that by Notification dated July 10, 1975 Item 14 in Schedule I was enlarged so as to include specifically exercise note books within the expression 'paper' clearly shows that 143 the legislative intent was to exclude exercise books from the expression 'paper' under Item 13 in Schedule I as it stood prior to that date. Lastly, he urged that since the provisions of the Act as well as the Regulation order were penal in character, the item 'paper' should be construed narrowly in favour of the person proceeded against and as such the view taken by the learned Sessions Judge should be upheld. In support of these submissions counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in State of Bihar vs Bhagirath Sharma and Another,(1) where this Court, having regard to the legislative history and penal character of the concerned order took the view that the item like 'component parts and accessories of automobile', though of wide import did not cover tyres and tubes of motor cars and motor cycles. According to him, therefore, the learned Sessions Judge was right in his view that the expression 'paper' did not cover exercise book and that the seized exercise books were not liable to be confiscated under section 6A of the Act. The question thus centres round the proper construction of the item 'paper' as described in section 2(a) (vii) of the Act and item No. 13 of Schedule I to the Regulation order. On this question the object or purpose of the Act and the Regulation order as well as the manner in which 'essential commodity ' or 'essential article has been defined therein will have considerable bearing. As stated earlier, the object or purpose of both the pieces of legislation is to control the production, supply and distribution of essential commodities or essential articles with view to ensure that the common man gets them at fair prices without any let or hindrance on the part of the trade and it is with this object that the item 'paper' has been enlisted as an essential commodity or essential article in the Act and take Regulation order. Further though section 2(a) of the Act and Cl. 2(v) of the Regulation order purport to define 'essential commodity ' or 'essential article ' that expression has no meaning of its own and in substance both under section 2 (a) (vii) of the Act and Cl. 2 (v) of the Regulation order an enumeration or enlistment has been made of several items as constituting essential commodities or essential articles for the purposes of the Act and the Regulation Order and it will appear clear that items have been enumerated or enlisted under broad general heads and some of the items are stated to include certain things which may not in ordinary parlance fall within the broad general head. The item 'paper' will have to be considered in the light of this position which emerges clearly on a consideration of several items enlisted as essential commodities or essential articles. The item 'paper' is described thus: 'Paper including news print, paper board and straw board'. (1) ; 144 According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary paper means 'A substance used for writing, printing, drawing, etc. made of interlaced fibres of rags, straw, wood, etc. ' In Webster 's New World Dictionary (1962 Edn.) the meaning of the word 'paper' is given as follows: 'Paper thin flexible material in sheets or leaves, made from rags, wood pulp., or other fibrous decorate etc.' In Black 's Law Dictionary (Revised Fourth Edition 1968) the expression 'paper' is explained thus: 'Paper a manufactured substance composed of fibres (whether vegetable or animal) adhering together in forms consisting of sheets of various sizes and of different thicknesses, used for writing or printing or other purposes to which flexible sheets are applicable.' In substance, therefore, paper, whether lined or blank, means a material on which writing, printing, drawing etc. can be done. In light of this meaning of the expression 'paper' the question is whether an exercise book would be covered by that expression or not ? It cannot be disputed that an exercise book is nothing but a collection of sheets of paper (blank or lined) stitched together by a piece of string or pinned together with pins of a stappler and is a substance used for writing and, therefore, would clearly fall within the item 'paper'. The test would be whether because of stitching or pinning them together such a collection of sheets looses its identity as paper ? The answer must be in the negative. Looked at from this angle it is difficult to accept the contention that an exercise book is a distinct commodity other than paper. It is true that an inclusive description has been given of the item 'paper' in section 2(a) (vii) of the Act and Item 13 in Schedule I to the Regulation order, but if the inclusive part is carefully scrutinised it will appear clear that the things mentioned in the inclusive part may not ordinarily be regarded as paper and, therefore, by the inclusive part an extended meaning or description is given to the expression 'paper'. Since an exercise book (which is nothing but a collection of sheets of paper intended to be used for writing) squarely falls within the dictionary meaning of the word 'paper' there was no necessity to mention it in the inclusive part of the description. On a true and proper construction, therefore, we are clearly of the view that within its normal dictionary meaning the item 'paper' as described in section 2(a) (vii) of the Act and Item 13 in Schedule I to the Regulation order covers an exercise book. 145 Moreover, such a construction would be in consonance with and carry out effectively the object or purpose of the Act and the Regulation order. Counsel for the appellant undoubtedly relied upon the fact that so far as the Gujarat Regulation order is concerned it was by notification dated July 10, 1975 that the description of item 'paper' (being item No. 14 in the recast Schedule I) was enlarged so as to include specifically 'exercise notebooks ' and, according to counsel, this clearly shows that initially the legislative intent was to exclude exercise book from the expression 'paper' under Item 13 in Schedule I to the said order as it originally stood. It is not possible to infer such legislative intent from the mere fact that the item 'paper' has been amended and enlarged so as to include within it exercise books by means of the subsequent Notification. In fact, as discussed earlier, since an exercise book squarely falls within the dictionary meaning of the expression 'paper' we have held that it was unnecessary to mention it in the inclusive part of the description as it originally stood and in that inclusive part such things had been mentioned as could not in ordinary parlance be regarded as 'paper'. In our view the amendment and enlargement of the item 'paper' so as to include specifically exercise books was made ex majore cautela to make things abundantly clear and, therefore, no inference as regards the initial legislative intent of the type suggested can be drawn. Counsel also contended that since the Act as well as the Regulation order contain penal provisions, the item 'paper' should he construed strictly and narrowly in favour of the appellant firm which was being proceeded against under the said pieces of legislation. The true rule of construction in that behalf has been set out in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edn.) at page 246 where the following passage occurs: 'The effect of the rule of strict construction might be sum med up by saying that, where an equivocal word or ambiguous sentence leaves a reasonable doubt of its meaning which the canons of interpretation fail to solve, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the subject and against the legislature which has failed to explain itself. If there is no ambiguity, and the act or omission in question falls clearly within the mischief of the statute, the construction of a penal statute differs little, if at all, from that of any other. ' It would thus appear clear that it is only when there is some equivocation or ambiguity about a word or provision that the rule of strict construction or narrow construction in favour of the subject is to be applied 146 but if there is no ambiguity and the act or omission falls clearly within the mischief of statute then the construction of a penal statute will not differ from that of any other. Applying this principle to the facts of the present case it is clear that there is no ambiguity or equivocation of the item 'paper ' occurring in section 2(a) (vii) of the Act and Item 13 of Schedule I of the Regulation order and since an exercise book squarely falls within the dictionary meaning of 'paper' as used in the said provisions, there will be no question of construing that item narrowly so as to exclude exercise book therefrom and in favour of the appellant firm. That takes us to the decision of this Court in State of Bihar vs Bhagirath Sharma and Anr. (supra) on which the appellant firm strongly relied. In that case the question was whether Motor Tyres and Motor Tubes were covered by the item 'Component parts and accessories of automobiles' occuring in Item No. 1 in Schedule I to the Bihar Essential Commodities Act other than Foodgrains Prices and Stocks (Display and Control) order 1947 and this Court undoubtedly took the view that though the said item I was widely worded it did not include Motor Tyres or Motor Tubes and that no interference was called for in the order passed by the High Court acquitting the respondents of the charge that they had failed to display the price list and the stock position of the Motor Tyres anywhere in their shop in contravention of Cl. (4) of the said order. In our view, the decision is clearly distinguishable on the ground that the drafting precedents furnished by several Notifications that obtained there warranted such a conclusion. From the inception along with Item 1 (component parts and accessories of automobiles) there was in the concerned Prices and Stocks (Display and Control) order, 1947 another item being Item 5 which ran thus: 'Cycle tyres and tubes (including cycle rickshaw tyres and tubes)' which suggested that where 'Tyres and Tubes' were intended to be included as the Item in the Schedule these had actually been expressly so stated as distinct from the 'component parts and accessories or automobiles'; further, by a Gazette Notification (No. GSR 82) dated September 18, 1970 published in the Bihar Government Gazette (Extra ordinary) four items were added, one of them being Item No. 11, Which ran thus: 'Tyres and tubes of cars, buses, jeeps, vans, trucks automobiles of any category whatsoever, tractors and tractor trollies. ', even the Central Government had issued three Notifications a Notification dated 11 January, 1968 (No. S.O. 218) issued by the Ministry of Commerce, in which 'Tyres and Tubes of Scooters' were expressly mentioned as essential commodities distinct from the component parts and accessories of automobiles; a Notification dated 22 August, 1968 (No. s o. 2878) in which 'Tyres and Tubes of Cars etc.' were. 147 specifically mentioned as essential commodity and a Notification dated A 3rd January, 1969 (No. S.O. 25) in which 'Tyres and Tubes of Cars ' were mentioned in the manner almost similar to the one found in the Bihar Government Gazette Notification No. GSR 82 dated 18 September, 1970. It was in the back ground of these drafting precedents furnished by such Notifications that this Court took the view that the draftsman did not intend the scheduled item No. 1 in the Order as in force in May, 1969 to cover 'Tyres and Tubes of Motor cars'. In the instant case before us there are no such drafting precedents of the type which obtained in the aforementioned case. As stated earlier, the Item 'paper' in s.2 (a) (vii) in the Act has all along remained the same without any modification, alteration or enlargement and it is only the item No. 13 in the Schedule to the Regulation order (a subordinate piece of legislation) that has undergone a change and the item has been amended so as to include specifically 'exercise notebooks'. We have no doubt in our minds that the said amendment to the item 'paper' is declaratory or clarificatory in nature. In the circumstances, in our view, the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the exercise books of the appellant firm that were seized were liable to confiscation and the remand order made by the High Court was proper. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. N.V.K. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 124 of 1959.\nAppeal by special leave from the Award dated February 8, 1957, of the Additional Industrial Tribunal, Delhi, in Misc.\nI. D. Case No. 422 of 1956.\nJawala Prasad Chopra and J. K. Haranandani, for the appellants.\nC. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General of India, H. J. Umrigar, M. K. Ramamurthi, V. A. Seyid Muhamad and M. R. Krishna Pillai, for the respondent.\nMarch 22.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.\nThis appeal by special leave is directed against the order passed by the Additional Industrial Tribunal, Delhi, directing the appellant, M/s. New India Motors Private Ltd., to reinstate its former employee, K. T. Morris, the respondent, in his original post as field service representative and to pay him his back wages from the date of his dismissal till the date of his reinstatement.\nThis award has been made on a complaint filed by the respondent against the appellant under section 33A of the XIV of 1947 (hereinafter called the Act).\nIt appears that before joining the appellant the respondent was working with a firm in Calcutta; prior to that he was field service representative of M/s. Premier Automobiles Ltd., Bombay.\nThe respondent joined the services of the appellant sometime in May 1954 as Works Manager.\nBefore he joined the services of the appellant he had been told by the appellant by its letter dated March 27, 1954, that the appellant would be willing to pay him Rs. 350 per month and something more by way of certain percentage on business.\nHe was, however, asked to interview the 352 appellant; an interview followed and the respondent was given a letter of appointment on May 6, 1954.\nBy this letter he was appointed as Workshop Manager in the appellant 's firm on three months ' probation subject to the terms and conditions specified in the letter of appointment (exhibit W 2).\nThe respondent continued in this post till February 28, 1955, when he was given the assignment of the appellant 's field service organiser with effect from March 1, 1955.\nA letter of appointment given to him on 28 2 1955 set forth the terms and conditions of his new assignment.\nIt appears that on April 18, 1956, the management of the appellant called for an explanation of the respondent in respect of several complaints.\nAn explanation was given by the respondent.\nIt was, however, followed by another communication from the appellant to the respondent setting forth specific instances of the respondent 's conduct for which explanation was demanded.\nThe respondent again explained and disputed the correctness of the charges.\nOn June 30, 1956, the respondent 's services were terminated on the ground that the appellant had decided to abolish the post of field service representative.\nIt is this order which gave rise to the respondent 's complaint under section 33A of the Act.\nThe complaint was filed on July 18, 1956.\nThe respondent invoked section 33A because his case was that at the time when his services were terminated an industrial dispute was pending between the appellant and 7 of its employees and the respondent was one of the workmen concerned in the said industrial dispute.\nThe said industrial dispute had reference to the termination of the services of the said 7 employees who were working with the appellant as apprentices.\nOn their behalf it was alleged that their termination of service was improper and illegal and that was referred to the industrial tribunal for its adjudication on August 20, 1955.\nThe said dispute was finally decided on January 2, 1957.\nWith the merits of the said dispute or the decision thereof we are not concerned in the present appeal.\nAccording to the respondent, since he was a workman concerned in the said dispute section 33(1)(a) applied and it was not open to the appellant to terminate his 353 services save with the express permission in writing of the authority before which the said dispute was pending.\nIt was on this basis that he made his complaint under section 33A of the Act.\nBefore the tribunal the appellant urged that the respondent was not a workman as defined by the Act, and on the ' merits it was contended that the appellant had to abolish the post of the field service organiser owing to the fact that a part of the agency work of the appellant had been lost to it.\nOn the other hand, the respondent contended that he was a workman under the Act and the plea made by the appellant about the necessity to abolish his post was not true and genuine.\nHis grievance was that his services were terminated solely because he had taken interest in the complaint of the 7 apprentices which had given rise to the main industrial dispute and had in fact given evidence in the said dispute on behalf of the said apprentices.\nThe tribunal has found that the respondent is a workman under the Act, that there was no evidence to justify the appellant 's contention that it had become necessary for it to abolish the respondent 's post, and that it did appear that the respondent had been discharged because the appellant disapproved of the respondent 's conduct in supporting the 7 apprentices in the main industrial dispute.\nAs a result of these findings the tribunal has ordered the appellant to reinstate the respondent.\nThe question as to whether the respondent is a workman as defined by section 2(s) of the Act is a question of fact and the finding recorded by the tribunal on the said question, after considering the relevant evidence adduced by the parties, cannot be successfully challenged before us in the present appeal.\nThe respondent has given evidence as to the nature of the work he was required to do as field service organiser.\nThe letter of appointment issued to him in that behalf expressly required, inter alia, that the respondent had, if need be, to check up and carry out necessary adjustments and repairs of the vehicles sold by the appellant to its customers and to obtain signatures of responsible persons on the satisfaction 354 forms which had been provided to him.\nThe respondent swore that he looked after the working of the workshop and assisted the mechanics and others in their jobs.\nHe attended to complicated work himself and made the workmen acquainted with Miller 's special tools and equipment needed for repairs and servicing of cars.\nHe denied the suggestion that he was a member of the supervisory staff.\nOn this evidence the tribunal has based its finding that the respondent was a workman under section 2(s), and we see no reason to interfere with it.\nThen, as to the appellant 's case that it had to abolish the post of the respondent as it had lost the agency of DeSoto cars from Premier Automobiles, there is no reliable evidence to show when this agency was actually lost.\nBesides, the fact that the appellant has appointed a Technical Supervisor after discharging the respondent is also not without significance.\nFurthermore, the appellant is still the agent for Plymouth and Jeeps and the tribunal is right when it has found that it still needed a field representative to look after servicing of sold cars at outside stations.\nOn the other hand, the evidence of the respondent clearly shows that he supported the case of the 7 apprentices and that provoked the appellant to take the step of terminating his services.\nThe process of finding fault with his work appears to have commenced after the appellant disapproved of the respondent 's conduct in that behalf.\nWe are, therefore, satisfied that the tribunal was right in coming to the conclusion that the dismissal of the respondent is not sup ported on any reasonable ground, and in fact is due to the appellant 's indignation at the conduct of the respondent in the main industrial dispute between the appellant and its 7 employees.\nIf that be the true position the industrial tribunal was justified in treating the dismissal of the respondent as mala fide.\nIt has, however, been urged before us by the appellant that the complaint made by the respondent under section 33A is not competent.\nIt is common ground that a complaint can be made under section 33A only if section 33 has been contravened, and so the appellant 's argument is that B. 33(1)(a) is inapplicable because the respondent 355 was not a workman concerned in the main industrial dispute, and as such his dismissal cannot be said to contravene the provisions of the said section.\nIndeed the principal point urged before us by the appellant is in regard to the construction of section 33(1)(a) of the Act.\nWas the respondent a workman concerned with the main industrial dispute ? That is the point of law raised for our decision and its decision depends upon the construction of the relevant words used in section 33(1)(a).\nSection 33(1)(a) as it stood prior to the amendment of 1956 provided, inter alia, that during the pendency of any proceedings before a tribunal, no employer shall alter to the prejudice of the workmen concerned in the said dispute the conditions of service applicable to them immediately before the commencement of the said proceedings, save with the express permission in writing of the tribunal.\nSection 33 has been modified from time to time and its scope has been finally limited by the amendment made by Act 36 of 1956.\nWith the said amendments we are, however, not con cerned.\nThe, expression \"the workmen concerned in such dispute\" which occurred in the earlier section has not been modified and the construction which we would place upon the said expression under the unamended section would govern the construction of the said expression even in the amended section.\nWhat does the expression \"workmen concerned in such dispute\" mean ? The appellant contends that the main dispute was in regard to the discharge of 7 apprentices employed by the appellant, and it is only the said 7 apprentices who were concerned in the said dispute.\nThe respondent was not concerned in the said dispute, and so the termination of his services cannot attract the provisions of section 33(1)(a).\nPrima facie the argument that \"workmen concerned in such dispute\" should be limited to the workmen directly or actually concerned in such dispute appears plausible, but if we examine the scheme of the Act and the effect of its material and relevant provisions this limited construction of the clause in question cannot be accepted, 356 Let us first consider the definition of the industrial dispute prescribed by section 2(k).\nIt means, inter alia, any dispute or difference between employers and workmen which is connected with the employment or non employment, or the terms of employment, or with the conditions of labour, of any person.\nIt is well settled that before any dispute between the employer and his employee or employees can be said to be an industrial dispute under the Act it must be sponsored by a number of workmen or by a union representing them.\nIt is not necessary that the number of workmen of the union that sponsors the dispute should represent the majority of workmen.\nEven so, an individual dispute cannot become an industrial dispute at the instance of the aggrieved individual himself It must be a dispute between the employer on the one hand and his employees acting collectively on the other.\nThis essential nature of an industrial dispute must be borne in mind in interpreting the material clause in section 33(1)(a).\nSection 18 of the Act is also relevant for this purpose.\nIt deals with persons on whom awards are binding.\nSection 18(3) provides, inter alia, that an award of a tribunal which has become enforceable shall be binding on (a) all parties to the industrial dispute, (b) all other parties summoned to appear in the proceedings as parties to the dispute unless the tribunal records the opinion that they were so summoned without proper cause, and (c) where a party referred to in cl.\n(a) or cl.\n(b) is composed of workmen all persons who were employed in the establishment or part of the establishment, as the case may be, to which the dispute relates on the date of the dispute, and all persons who subsequently become employed in that establishment or part.\nIt is thus clear that the award passed in an industrial dispute raised even by a minority union binds not only the parties to the dispute but all employees in the establishment or part of the establishment, as the case may be, at the date of the dispute and even those who may join the establishment or part subsequently.\nThus the circle of persons bound by the award is very much wider than the parties to the industrial dispute.\nThis aspect of the 357 matter is also relevant in construing the material words in section 33(1)(a).\nIn this connection the object of section 33 must also be borne in mind.\nIt is plain that by enacting section 33 the Legislature wanted to ensure a fair and satisfactory enquiry of the industrial dispute undisturbed by any action on the part of the employer or the employee which would create fresh cause for disharmony between them.\nDuring the pendency of an industrial dispute status quo should be maintained and no further element of discord should be introduced.\nThat being the object of section 33 the narrow construction of the material words used in section 33(1)(a) would tend to defeat the said object.\nIf it is held that the workmen concerned in the dispute are only those who are directly or immediately concerned with the dispute it would leave liberty to the employer to alter the terms and conditions of the remaining workmen and that would inevitably introduce further complications which it is intended to avoid.\nSimilarly it would leave liberty to the other employees to raise disputes and that again is not desirable.\nThat is why the main object underlying section 33 is inconsistent with the narrow construction sought to be placed by the appellant on the material words used in section 33(1)(a).\nEven as a matter of construction pure and simple there is no justification for assuming that the workmen concerned in such disputes must be workmen directly or immediately concerned in the said disputes.\nWe do ' not see any justification for adding the further qualification of direct or immediate concern which the narrow construction necessarily assumes.\nIn dealing with the question as to which workmen can be said to be concerned in an industrial dispute we have to bear in mind the essential condition for the raising of an industrial dispute itself, and if an industrial dispute can be raised only by a group of workmen acting on their own or through their union then it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that all those who sponsored the dispute are concerned in it.\nAs we have already pointed out this construction is harmonious with the definition prescribed by section 2(s) and with the provisions contained in section 18 of the Act.\nTherefore, 46 358 we are not prepared to hold that the expression \"workmen concerned in such dispute\" can be limited only to such of the workmen who are directly concerned with the dispute in question.\nIn our opinion, that expression includes all workmen on whose behalf the dispute has been raised as well as those who would be bound by the award which may be made in the said dispute.\nIt appears that the construction of the relevant clause had given rise to a divergence of opinion in industrial courts, but it may be stated that on the whole the consensus of opinion appears to be in favour of the construction which we are putting on the said clause.\nIn Eastern Plywood Manufacturing Co. Ltd. vs Eastern Plywood Manufacturing Workers ' Union (1) the appellate tribunal has referred to the said conflict of views and has.\nheld that the narrow construction of the clause is not justified.\nThe High Court of Madras appears to have taken the same view (Vide: Newtone Studios Ltd. vs Ethirajulu (T.R.) (2) ).\nOn the other hand, in The New Jehangir Vakil Mills Ltd., Bhavnagar vs N.L. Vyas & Ors.\n(3), the Bombay High Court has adopted the narrow construction ; but for reasons which we have already explained we must hold that the Bombay view is not justified on a fair and reasonable construction of the relevant clause.\nIn the result the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed,.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 4742 43 of 1984. a Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and order dated the 9th August, 1984 of the Calcutta High Court in FMAT No. 2139 of 1984 and 2023 of 1984. K. Parasaran, Attorney General, V. J. Francis, Chandrasekharan, N.M. Popli and Miss Savitha Sharma for the Appellant. F. section Nariman, D. N. Gupta and Harish Salve for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHlNNAPPA REDDY, J. It is indeed a great pity and, we wish we did not have to say it but we are afraid;we will be signally failing in our duty if we do not do so some courts, of late, appear to have developed an unwarranted tendency to grant interim orders interim orders with a great potential for public mischief for the mere asking. We feel greatly disturbed. We find it more distressing that such interim orders, often ex parte and non speaking, are made even by the High Courts while entertaining writ petitions under article 226 of the Constitution, and in the Calcutta High Court, on oral application too. Recently in Samaries Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. vs section Samuel & Ors(l). we had occasion to condemn and prohibit this practice of entertaining oral applications under article 226 and passing interim orders thereon. In several other cases, Siliguri Municipality vs Amelendu Das(2), Titagur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. State of Orissa,(3) Union (1) ; (2) (3) 193 Of India vs Oswal Woollen Mills Ltd(l). , Union of India vs Jain Shubh A Vanaspati Ltd.(a), this Court was forced to point out how wrong it was to make interim orders so soon as an application was but presented, when a second thought (or a second 's thought) would expose the impairment of the public interest and often enough the existence of a suitable alternative remedy. Despite the fact that we have set our 8 face against interfering with interim orders passed by the High Courts and made it practically a rigid rule not to so interfere, we were constrained to interfere in those cases. In Siliguri Municipality vs Amalendu Das, (supra) A. P. Sen and M. P. Thakkar, JJ. had to deal with an interlocutory order passed by the Calcutta High Court restraining the Siliguri Municipality from recovering a graduated consolidate rate on the annual value of buildings in terms of the amended provisions of the Bengal Municipal Act. We reiterate the following observations made therein: \"We are constrained to make the observations which follows as we do feel dismayed at the tendency on the part of some of the High Courts to grant interlocutory orders for the mere asking. Normally, the High Court should not, as a rule, in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution grant any stay of recovery of tax save under very exceptional circumstances. The grant to stay in such matters, should be an exception and not a rule.\" \"It is needless to stress that a levy or impost does not become bad as soon as a writ petition is instituted in order to assail the validity of the levy. So also there is no warrant for presuming the levy to be bad at the very threshold of the proceedings. The only consideration at that juncture is to ensure that no prejudice is occasioned to the rate payers in case they ultimately succeed at the conclusion of the proceedings. This object can be attained by requiring the body or authority levying the impost to give an undertaking to refund or adjust against future dues, the levy of tax or rate or a part thereof, as the case may be, in the event of the entire levy or a part thereof being ultimately held (l) t (2) C, A. No. 11420 of 1983 194 to be invalid by the court without obliging the tax payers to institute a civil suit in order to claim the amount already recovered from them. On the other hand, the Court cannot be unmindful of the need to protect the authority levying the tax, for, at that stage the Court has to proceed on the hypothesis that the challenge may or may not succeed. The Court has to show awareness of the fact that in a case like the present a municipality cannot function or meet its financial obligations if its source of revenue is blocked by an interim order restraining the municipality from recovering the taxes as per the impugned provision. And that the municipality has to maintain essential civic services like water supply, street lighting and public streets etc., apart from cunning public institutions like schools, dispensaries, libraries etc. What is more, supplies have to be purchased and salaries have to paid. The grant of an interlocutory order of This nature would paralyze the administration and dislocate the entire working of the municipality. It seems that these serious ramifications of the matter were lost sight of while making the impugned order\". In Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. vs S/ate of Orissa A. P. Sen E. section Venkataramiah and R. B. Misra, JJ. held that where the statute itself provided the petitioners with an efficacious alternative remedy by way of an appeal to the Prescribed Authority, a second appeal to the Tribunal and there after to have the case stated to the High Court, it was not for the High Court to exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution ignoring as it were, the complete statuary machinery. That it has become necessary, even now, to as to repeat this admonition is indeed a matter of tragic concern to us. Article 226 is not meant to short circuit of circumvent statutory procedures. It is only were statutory remedies are entirely ill suited to meet the demands of extraordinary situations, as for instance where the very vires of thee statute is in question or where private or public wrongs are so inextricably mixed up and the prevention of public injury and the vindication of public justice require it that recourse may be had to article 226 of the Constitution. But then the Court must have good and sufficient reason to by pass the alternative remedy provided by statute. Surely matters involving the revenue where statutory remedies are available are not such matters. We can also take judicial notice of the fact that the vast 195 majority of the petitions under article 226 o the Constitution are filed . solely for the purpose of obtaining interim orders and there after prolong the proceedings by one device or the other. The practice certainly needs to be strongly couraged. In Union of India vs Oswal Woollen Mills Ltd., we had occasion to consider an interim order passed by the Calcutta High Court in regard to a matter no part of the cause of action relating to which appeared to arise within the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. In that case the interim order practically granted the very prayers in the writ petition. We were forced to observe, \"It is obvious that the interim order is of a drastic character with a great potential for mischief. The principal prayer in the writ petition is the challenge to the order made or proposed to be made under Clause 8 of the Import Control order. The interim order in terms of prayers (j) and (k) has the effect of practically allowing the writ petition at the stage of admission without hearing the opposite parties. While we do not wish to say that a drastic interim order may never be passed without hearing the opposite parties even if the circumstances justify it, we are very firmly of the opinion that a statutory order such as the one made in the present case under Clause 8 B of the Import Control order ought not to have been stayed without at least hearing those that made the order. Such a stay may lead to devastating consequences leaving no way of undoing the mischief. Where a plentitude of power is given under a statute, designed to meet a dire situation, it is no answer to say that the very nature of the power and the consequences which may ensue is itself a sufficient justification for the grant of a stay of that order, unless, of course, there are sufficient circumstances to justify a strong Prima facie inference that the order was made in abuse of the power conferred by the statute. A statutory order such as the one under Clause 8 B purports to be made in the public interest and unless there are even stronger grounds of public interest an expert interim order will not be justified. The only appropriate order to make in such cases is to issue notice to the respondent and make it returnable within a short period. This should particularly be so where the offices of the principals respondents and relevant records 196 lie outside the ordinary jurisdiction of the court. To grant interim relief straightaway and leave it to the respondents to move the court to vacate the interim order may kindise the public interest. It is notorious how if an interim order is once made by a court, parties employ every device and tactic to ward off the final hearing of the application. It is, therefore, necessary for the courts to be circumspect in the matter of granting interim relief, more particularly so where the interim relief is directed against orders or actions of public officials acting in discharge of their public duty and in exercise of statutory powers. On the facts and circumstance of the present case, we are satisfied that no interim relief should have been granted by the High Court in the terms in which it was done\", We repeat and deprecate the practice of granting interim order which practically give the principal relief sought in the petition for no better reason than that a prima facie case has been made out, without being concerned about the balance of convenience, the public interest and a host of other relevant considerations. Regarding the practice of some clever litigants of resorting to filing writ petitions in the far away courts having doubtful jurisdiction, we had this to observe: \". . Having regard to the fact that the registered office of the Company is at Ludhiana and the principal respondents against whom the primary relief is sought are at New Delhi, one would have expected the writ petition to be filed either in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana or p in the Delhi High Court. The writ petitioners however, have chosen the Calcutta High Court as the forum perhaps because one of the interlocutory reliefs which is sought is in respect of a consignment of beef tallow which has arrived at the Calcutta Port. An inevitable result of the filing of writ petitions elsewhere than at the place where the concerned offices and the relevant records are located is to delay prompt return and contest. We do not desire to probe further into the question whether the writ petition was filed by design or accident in the Calcutta High Court when the office of the Company is in the State of Punjab and all the principal respondents are in Delhi. But we do feel disturbed that such writ petitions are of ten deliberately 197 filed in distant High Courts, as part of a manoeuvre in a legal battle, so as to render it difficult for the officials at Delhi to move applications to vacate stay where it becomes necessary to file such applications\". In Union of India vs Jain Shudha Banaspati Ltd. (supra), Chandrachud, CJ., A. P. Sen, R. N. Misra, JJ. allowed an appeal against an interim order making the following observations: \"After hearing learned counsel for the rival parties, we are of the opinion that the interim order passed by the High Court on November 29, 1983 is not warranted since it virtually grants to the respondents a substantial part of the relief claimed by them in their writ petition. Accordingly, we set aside the said order\". We have come across cases where the collection of public revenue has been seriously kindised and budgets of Governments and Local Authorities affirmatively prejudiced to the point of precariousness consequent upon interim orders made by courts. In fact instances have come to our knowledge where Governments have been forced to explore further sources for raising revenue, sources which they would rather well leave alone in the public interest, because of the stays granted by courts. We have come across cases where an entire Service is left in a stay of flutter and unrest because of interim orders passed by courts, leaving the work they are supposed to do in a state of suspended animation. We have come across cases where buses and lorries are being run under orders of court though they were either denied permits or their permits had been canceled or suspended by Transport Authorities. We have come across cases where liquor shops are being run under interim orders of court. We have come across cases where the collection of monthly rentals payable by Excise Contractors has been stayed with the result that at the and of the year the contractor has paid nothing but made his profits from the shop and walked out. We have come across cases where dealers in food grains and essential commodities have been allowed to take back the stocks seized from them as if to permit them to continue to indulge in the very practices which were to be prevented by the seizure. We have come across cases where land reform and important welfare legislations have been stayed by courts. Incalculable harm has been done by such interim orders. All this is not to say that interim orders may never be 198 made against public authorities. There are, of course, cases which demand that interim orders should be made in the interests of justice. Where gross violations of the law and injustices are perpetrated or are about to be perpetrated, it is the bounden duty of the court to intervene and give appropriate interim relief. In cases where denial of interim relief may lead to public mischief, grave irreparable private injury or shake a citizen 's faith in the impartiality of public administration, a Court may well be justified in granting interim relief against public authority. But since the law presumes that public authorities function properly and bonafide with due regard to the public interest, a court must be circumspect in granting interim orders of far reaching dimensions or orders causing administrative, burdensome inconvenience or orders preventing collection of public revenue for no better reason than that the parties have come to the Court alleging prejudice, inconvenience or harm and that a prima facie case has been shown. There can be and there are no hard and fast rules. But prudence, discretion and circumspection are called for. There are several other vital considerations apart from the existence of a prima facia case. There is the question of balance of convenience. There is the question of irreparable injury. There is the question of the public interest There are many such factors worthy of consideration. We often wonder why in the case indirect taxation where the burden has already been passed on to the consumer, any interim relief should at all be given to the manufacturer, dealer and the like ! There is just one more thing that we wish to say. In Siliguri vs Amalendu Das, the Court was put to the necessity of pointing out the following: \"We will be failing in our duty if we do not advert to feature which causes us dismay and distress. On a previous occasion, a Division Bench had vacated an interim order passed by a learned single Judge on similar facts in a similar situation. Even so when a similar matter giving rise to the present appeal came up again, the same learned judge whose order had been reversed earlier, granted a non speaking interlocutory order of the aforesaid nature. This order was in turn confirmed by a Division Bench without a speaking order articulating reasons for granting a stay when the earlier Bench had vacated the stay. We 199 mean no disrespect to the High Court in emphasizing the necessity for self imposed discipline in such matters in obeisance to such weighty institutional considerations like the need to maintain decorum and comity. So also we mean no disrespect to the High Court in stressing the need for self discipline on the part of the High Court in passing interim orders without entering into the question of amplitude and width of the powers of the High Court to grant interim relief. The main purpose of passing an interim order is to evolve a workable formula or a workable arrangement to the extent called for by the demands of the situation keeping in mind the presumption regarding the constitutionality of the legislation and the vulnerability of the challenge, only in order that no irreparable injury is occasioned. The Court has therefore to strike a delicate balance after considering the pros and cons of the matter lest larger public interest is not kindized and institutional embarrassment is eschewed\". We desire to add and as was said in Cassel and Co. Ltd. vs Broome(l) we hope it will never be necessary for us to say so again that 'in the hierarchical system of Courts ' which exists in our country, 'it is necessary for each lower tier ', including the High Court, 'to accept loyally the decisions of the higher tiers '. \"It is inevitable in a hierarchical system of Courts that there are decisions 11 of the Supreme appellate tribunal which do not attract the unanimous approval of all members of the judiciary. . . But the judicial system only works if someone is allowed to have the last word and that last word, once spoken, is loyally accepted\"(2). The better wisdom of the Court below must yield to the higher wisdom of the Court above. That is the strength of the hierarchical judicial system. In Cassel vs Broome, commenting on the Court of Appeal 's comment that Rookes vs Barnard(3) was rendered per incuriam Lord Diplock observed, \"The Court of Appeal found themselves able to disregard the decision of this House in Rookes vs Barnard by applying to it the label per incuriam That label is relevant only to the right of an appellate court to decline to (1) ; (2) (See observations of Lord Hailsham and Lord Dipock in Broome vs Cassell). (3) [1984] A.C. 1129. 200 follow one of its own previous decisions, not to its right to disregard a decision of a higher appellate court or to the right of a judge of the High Court to disregard a decision of the Court of Appeal. \" It is needless to add that in India under Act. 141 of the Constitution the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India and under article 144 all authorities, civil and judicial in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme Court. Now coming to the facts of the present case, the respondent, Dunlop India Limited is a manufacturer of types, tubes and various other rubber products. By a notification dated April 6, 1984 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue) in exercise of the powers conferred by Rule 8 (1) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, types, falling under item No. 16 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, were exempt from a certain percentage of excise duty to the extent that the manufacturers had not availed themselves of the exemption granted under certain other earlier notifications The Department was of the view that the Company was not entitled to the exemption as it had cleared the goods earlier without paying central excise duty, but on furnishing Bank Guarantees under various interim orders of courts. The Company claimed the benefit of the exemption to the tune of Rs. 6.05 crores and filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court and sought an interim order restraining the central excise authorities from the levy and collection of excise duty. The learned single judge took the view that a prima facie case had been made out in favour of the Company and by an interim order allowed the benefit of the exemption to the tune of Rs. two crores ninety three lakhs and eighty five thousand for which amount the company was directed to furnish a Bank Guarantee, that is to say, the goods were directed to be released on the Bank Guarantee being furnished. An appeal was preferred by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise under clause 10 of the Letters Patent and a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court confirmed the order of the learned single Judge, but made a slight modification in that the Collector of Central Excise was given the liberty to encash 30% of the Bank Guarantee. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise has preferred this appeal by special leaue. By our interim order dated November 15, 1984, we vacated the orders granted by the learned single Judge 201 as well as by the Division Bench. We gave two weeks ' time to the A respondent Company to file a counter No. counter has, however been filed. Shri F.S. Nariman, learned counsel, however appeared for the respondent. We do not have the slightest doubt that the orders of the learned single judge as well as Division Bench are wholly unsustainable and should never been made. Even assuming that the company had established a prima facie case, about which we do not express any opinion, we do not think that it was sufficient justification for granting the interim orders as was done by High Court. There was no question of any balance of convenience being in favour of the respondent Company. The balance of convenience was certainly in favour of the Government of India. Governments are not run on mere Bank Guarantees. We notice that very often some courts act as if furnishing a Bank Guarantee would meet the ends of justice. No governmental business or for that matter no business of any kind can be run on mere Bank Guarantees. Liquid cash is necessary for the running of a Government as indeed any other enterprise. We consider that where matters of public revenue are concerned, it is of utmost importance to reales that interim orders ought not to be granted merely because a prima facie case has been shown. More is required. The balance of convenience must be clearly in favour of the making of an interim order and there should not be the slightest indication of a likelihood of prejudice to the public interest. We are very sorry to remark that these considerations have not been borne in mind by the High Court and interim order of this magnitude had been granted for the mere asking. The appeal is allowed with costs. E N.V.K. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 756 of 1965. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 9, 1965 of the Mysore High Court in Civil Revision Petition No. 1044 of 1962. section K. Venkatarangaiengar G. L. Sanghi, J. B. Dadachanji O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the appellant. Mirle N. Lakshminaraynappa O. P. Malhotra, section section Khanduja Ganpat Rai, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Mysore in Civil Revision Petition No. 1044 of 1962, filed under section 17 of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Act, 1951 (Mysore Act 30 of 1951)hereinafter referred to as the Act whereby the High Court set aside the order passed by the III Additional District Judge, Bangalore. The III Additional Judge had set aside the order of the First Munsiff, Bangalore, who had directed the eviction of the tenant from the premises in dispute. The appellant before us, Padmanabha Setty, hereinafter referred to as the tenant, was the tenant of a non residential premises No. 281, Old Tharagupet, Bangalore City. The tenant had installed some machinery in the premises. The respondent, K. P. Papiah Setty, is the landlord. He had purchased the premises for his own use and occupation, namely, for the purpose of shifting his business which he was carrying on in a rented building to the premises in dispute. The landlord tiled an application under s.8(3)(a)(ii) of the Act for the eviction of the tenant on the ground that he required the premises in dispute for his own use and occupation. It is not necessary to give the other allegations made in the application as both the First Munsiff, Bangalore, and the III Additional District Judge, Bangalore, have found that the landlord required the premises for his bonafide use and occupation, namely, for shifting his business from the rented premises to the premises in dispute. The III Additional District Judge, however, held that under section 8(3)(a)(ii) the landlord was not entitled to possession of the premises in dispute unless and until he was prepared to vacate the shops in which he was trading at the time. This finding of the learned Additional Judge was contrary to the decision of the Mysore High Court in section G. Narayanappa and Bros. vs A. N. Narasimhiah(1). The landlord then filed a revision petition under section 17 of the Act, and the High Court, following the decision in section G. Naravanappa and Bros. vs A. N. Narasimhiah(1) set aside the order of the Additional District Judge. The tenant having obtained special leave, the matter is now before us. Two points are raised before us: (1) that the construction put upon section 8(3)(a) (ii) of the Act by the Mysore High Court is erroneous and the construction put upon a similar provision by the Madras High Court in V. Thanappa Chetty vs Arcot Govindaswami Naicker(2) is correct; and (2) that the High Court was not right in setting aside the order of the Additional District Judge in a revision under section 17 of the Act. (1) (2) A.I.R, 1952 Mad. The Act was passed to regulate the letting of residential and non residential houses and to control the rents of such houses and to prevent unreasonable eviction of tenants therefrom in the State of Mysore. The word 'tenant' is defined as follows in sub section (9) of section 2 of the Act: 'tenant' means any person by whom or on whose account rent is payable for a house and includes the surviving spouse or any son or daughter of a deceased tenant who had been living with the tenant in the house as a member of the tenant's family up to the death of the tenant and a person continuing in possession after the termination of the tenancy in his favour, but does not include a person placed in occupation of a house by its tenant or a person to whom the collection of rents or fees in a public market, cart stand or slaughter house or of rents for shops has been farmed out or leased by a local authority. There is no doubt that the definition of the word 'tenant' is wider than the ordinary meaning of the word and includes a person ,continuing in possession after the termination of the tenancy in his favour. Section 4 deals with the determination of fair rent and section 5 with lawful increase of or addition to or reduction in fair rent. Section 6 prohibits the landlord from claiming or receiving anything in excess of fair rent or agreed rent. Section 7 deals with issue of receipts for rent. Sections 7A and 7 B deal with the right of tenant to deposit rent in certain cases and time for deposit and savings. Section 7 C deals with eviction of tenant in occupation of a house under an allotment order. Section 8 deals with eviction of tenants and provides that ,a tenant shall not be evicted whether in execution of a decree or otherwise except in accordance with the provisions of s.7 C or of this section. Sub section (2) provides the circumstances in which a landlord would be entitled to seek eviction of a tenant in possession. For instance, a landlord is entitled to evict a tenant if the tenant has not tendered or paid the rent due by him in respect of the premises within the time fixed in the agreement of tenancy with the landlord on in the absence of any such agreement, by the last day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable; if he has transferred his right under the lease or sublet the entire premises or any portion thereof; or used the premises for the purpose other than that for which they were leased; or if the tenant has committed such acts of waste as are likely to impair materially the value or utility of the house; or if the tenant has without the landlord 's consent in writing erected on the house or any portion thereof any permanent structure; or if the tenant or any person residing with the tenant has been guilty of such acts and conduct as amounts to nuisance or annoyance to the adjoining or neighbouring occupiers or has been using the house or allowing the house to be used for immoral or illegal purposes; or that the house is reasonably and bona fide required by the landlord for carrying out repairs or reconstruction which cannot be carried out without the house being vacated; or that the house has not been used without reasonable cause for the purpose for which it was let for a continuous period of three months immediately preceding the date of application; or that the tenant, after the commencement of the Act, has built, acquired vacant possession of or been allotted a suitable house. We have set out these conditions in detail because it would be relevant to consider whether in view of these conditions a tenant can be said to have a right to possession of the premises of which he is a tenant. Then we come to sub section (3) (a) which reads as follows: '(3)(a) A landlord may, subject to the provisions of clause (d) apply to the court for an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the house (i)in case it is a residential building, if the landlord requires it for his own occupation or for the occupation of a member of his family and if he or such member, as the case may be, is not occupying a residential building of his own in the city, town or village concerned; (ii)in case it is a non residential building, if the landlord requires it for a business which he or a member of his family is carrying on and if for the purposes of the said business is not in occupation of a non residential building which is owned by or to the possession of which the landlord or such member, as the case may be, is entitled whether under this Act or otherwise. ' It is not necessary to set out the Explanation or the first proviso but the second proviso is relevant and runs thus: 'Provided further that where a landlord has obtained possession of a house for his own use or occupation or for the use or occupation of a member of his family under this clause he shall not be entitled to apply again under this clause (ii)for possession of another non residential building of his own, for himself or for the same member of his family, in case he has obtained possession of a nonresidential building.' The Madras High Court held in V. Thannappa Chetty vs Arcot Govindaswami Naicker (1) that the tenant under the Madras Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act (Madras Act 15 of 1946) had a right to possession unless and until he was evicted under the provisions of the Madras Act, and, therefore, the landlord would not be entitled to possession of a non residential building if he was in possession of another non residential building as a tenant, for in such a case he would be entitled to possession of those premises. The reasoning of Subba Rao, J., then a Judge of the High Court of Madras, was as follows: 'It will, therefore, be seen that the relationship between the landlord and tenant even in cases in which such relationship terminated under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, continues subject to the provisions of the Act. The rights of the tenants as well as the landlord are defined. The tenant under the Act has a right to possession unless and until he is evicted under the provisions of the Act. Under the provisions of the Act, a landlord will not be entitled to the possession of his non residential buildings, if he obtains an order for eviction against another tenant in respect of another non residential building, or if he is in possession of another non residential building as a tenant; for in either case he is entitled to possession of that premises. The words used in the section, viz., 'to the possession of which he is entitled' are wide and I do not see any reason why the latter category should be excluded from the express words used which in their ordinary meaning take in that class.' 'It was argued that a statutory immunity is different from a right to possession. But in my view a statutory immunity is not inconsistent with a right to possession. The statutory immunity itself creates a right in him to continue in possession till he is evicted under the provisions of the Act. ' The Mysore High Court dissented from this decision of the Madras High Court, and the reasoning of Ahmed Ali Khan, J., in section G. Narayanappa and Bros. vs A. N. Narasimhiah(1) is as under: 'After a careful consideration of the arguments advanced before me, I am of the opinion that the provision of the Act on the strength of which a tenant may resist the landlord 's claim to evict him cannot be described as a right to possession, but only as a statutory immunity from eviction, as observed by the Federal Court in the case Kai Khushrao vs Bai Jerbai (2). It appears that his Lordship in the Madras case distinguished the said observations in the said case of the Federal Court by stating that a statutory immunity is not inconsistent with the right to possession and that such immunity may itself create a right. The right to immunity from eviction involves a negative element in it. In other words it restricts the right of possession of the landlord. Hence, it cannot be construed to have an effect of creating a right of possession to a tenant. Though the statutory immunity from eviction may not be consistent with the right to possession, the fact remains in view of the inherent element involved in both the rights, that the immunity from eviction cannot be equated to the right to possession. Therefore, with great respect, I am of the view that we will not be justified in adopting the strict view while interpreting the words which occur in section 8(3) (a)(ii) of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Act, as taken in the Madras ruling cited above. ' In our opinion, with great respect to Subba Rao, J., Ahmed Ali Khan, J., arrived at the correct conclusion. A tenant who can be evicted under the conditions prescribed in section 8(2) of the Act cannot be said, in our view, to be entitled to the possession of the premises of which he is a tenant. No doubt he cannot be evicted till one or more of the conditions prescribed by the section are fulfilled, but it is difficult to equate his right to stay in the premises till he is evicted to an entitlement of the possession of the premises. Section 8(3)(a)(ii) deals with two types of cases; first where the landlord is in occupation of a non residential building which is owned by him, and secondly, a non residential building of which he is in occupation not as a landlord but otherwise. The object of the Act is to prevent unreasonable evictions of tenants. Can it be said that the Legislature is considering it to be unreasonable for a landlord to shift to his own premises while he is in occupation of tenanted premises over which he has not an absolute right of possession but only a right to remain in possession till one of the conditions in section 8(2) is satisfied, and over one of which he has no control. For instance, the landlord may require the premises for repairs or reconstruction or the neighbours may complain that the tenant is guilty of nuisance or annoyance, or the landlord may think that the tenant has committed some acts of waste as are likely to impair materially the value or utility of the house. If any of these conditions is proved, he is liable to be evicted. In our view, in the context the words 'entitled to possession' have a more positive content and are more akin to the right of possession which an owner has in respect of the building owned and occupied by him. In conclusion we are of the view that the High Court was right in holding that the Additional District Judge erred in not following the decision of the Mysore High Court in section G. Narayanappa and Bros. vs A. N. Narasimhiah.(1) There is no force in the second point raised by the learned counsel of the tenant. It is true that the jurisdiction of a High Court under provisions similar to section 17 of the Act is limited, but we cannot say that the High Court was wrong in holding that the Additional District Judge acted with material irregularity in not following the decision of the Mysore High Court when that decision had been rendered in a case arising from an earlier order of the same Additional District Judge. It may be that this decision was not pointed out to the Additional District Judge but we cannot, in exercise of our jurisdiction under article 136 of the Constitution, say that the High Court should not have set aside the order of the Additional District Judge on this ground. In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. The tenant is granted two months' time from today to vacate and deliver possession of the premises in dispute to the landlord. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 497 of 1971. Appeal by certificate from the Judgment and Decree dated 2.5.1969 of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, (Indore Bench) in Civil First Appeal No. 91 of 1962. V.A. Bobde, S.D. Mudaliar and A.G. Ratnaparkhi for the appellants. G.L. Sanghi, D.N. Misra and section Sukumaran for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN, J. This appeal on certificate is directed against a judgment and decree of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dated May 2, 1969 substantially reversing the judgment and decree passed by the third Additional District Judge, Indore dated June 18/19,1962 and dismissing the plaintiffs' suit for partition and separate possession of their half share of the suit properties detailed in Schedule 'A' appended to the plaint except with respect to a house and the agricultural lands at Ujjain. During the course of the hearing the parties have come to a settlement and the terms of the compromise have been recorded. Nevertheless, the correctness of the judgment delivered by the High Court is open to serious doubt and as it involves a question of general importance, we proceed to record our views. The facts giving rise to the appeal are as follows. The report of the Inam Commissioner discloses that in 1837 the late Maharaja Harihar Rao Holkar made a grant of an inam of a garden known as Rambag in Kasba Indore admeasuring 15.62 acres to Abaji Ballal, the priest of the Holkar family on his representation that he was in service of the Huzur Darbar for a long period but had no garden at Kasba Indore and was therefore finding it difficult in getting tulsi leaves and flowers for making offerings to the deities. The grant of inam to him was on Putra Pautradi Vansh Parampara condition by way of parvarish. It appears from the report that Abaji Ballai had only one son named Laxman and he also had only one son named Raghunath Rao. After the death of Abaji Ballal be was succeeded by Laxman. It appears that Laxman represented in the year 1886 that he was entitled to hold as inam an area of 15.62 acres in Kasba Indore while the land in his possession was only 5.91 acres, the remaining area having been acquired by the Durbar and prayed for a grant of an area of 9.72 acres in exchange. An inquiry was thereupon held and the claim was found to be true. By Durbar Order No. 9 dated December 14, 1888 the inamdar was given 9.72 acres of land in Mauja Palashiya Hana. It also appears that the family built residential houses at Indore presumably out of the income of the inam and also acquired immovable properties at Ujjain consisting of a house and some agricultural lands. After the death of Laxman Rao, his son Raghunath Rao was recognized to be the inamdar. The common ancestor Raghunath Rao had three sons, Madhav Rao, Sadashiv Rao and Gopal Rao. Of these, Madhav Rao and Sadashiv Rao had predeceased their father Raghunath Rao. Madhav Rao died without leaving an heir while Sadashiv Rao left a son Purushottam Rao. The third son Gopal Rao disappeared about an year before the death of his father Raghunath Rao and his whereabouts were not known till the news of his death in 1932 at the Secunderabad was received, after the death of Raghunath Rao in 1928. On the death of Raghunath Rao, the last Purushottam Rao being the sole survivor of the eldest male line of holder became the inamdar and also the karta of the joint Hindu family. The suit out of which this appeal arises was instituted by the three appellants Anant, Govind and their mother Smt. Laxmi Bai being the legal heirs and successors of Gopal Rao, as plaintiffs on December 12, 1955 for partition and separate possession of their half share in the joint family property described in Schedule 'A' appended to the plaint against respondents 1 and 2 Purushottam Rao and his mother Smt. Rama Bai being defendants 1 and 2, impleading Krishna Rao, the eldest son of Gopal Rao as defendant 3 because he failed to join them as a plaintiff in the suit. The case of the plaintiffs was that defendant No. 1 Purushottam Rao in his capacity as the karta of the joint Hindu family was in possession and management of the joint family property, including the inam lands at Kasba Indore and Mauja Palashiya Hana. The plaintiffs' claim was contested by defendants 1 and 2 Purushottam Rao and Smt. Rama Bai. They pleaded inter alia that the plaintiffs' predecessor in interest Gopal Rao had separated from the family by taking his share in the year 1917-18 and therefore the plaintiffs had no kind of right or title in the suit properties that the inam lands and the properties acquired from out of the inam being impartible in nature, the succession to which was governed by the rule of lineal primogeniture, the properties exclusively belonged to defendant No. 1 Purushottam Rao; and that the conferral of bhumiswami rights on respondent 1 under section 158(1)(b) of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1959 made the suit lands his separate and exclusive property and it was not part of the joint estate of the undivided family. Incidentally, the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1959 was brought into force w.e.f. October 1, 1959 which had the effect of changing the nature of the tenure. The point in controversy in this appeal is now limited to the inam lands and the houses and other properties built from out of the income of the inam lands at Kasba Indore and Mauja Palashiya Hana. The learned Additional District Judge held that the inam lands together with the properties acquired from the income of the inam were ancestral impartible estate since the same had devolved by survivorship by the rule of lineal primogeniture and therefore constituted joint family property and that the rule of impartibility and the special mode of succession by the rule of lineal primogeniture were nothing but incidents of the inam which stood extinguished by section 158(1)(b) of the Code by virtue of which the inam lands became bhumiswami, the succession to which was governed by the personal law of the parties. The learned Additional District Judge accordingly held that the inam lands at Kasba Indore and Mauja Palashiya Hana constituted joint family property of the parties and decreed the plaintiffs' claim for partition and separate possession to the extent of their half share in the properties described in Schedule 'A' to the plaint and to mesne profits thereof. On appeal, the High Court reversed the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge with regard to the inam lands and the houses and other property acquired at Indore out of the income of the inam holding that they constituted a special grant regulated by the Jagir Manual of the Holkar State. According to the High Court, the plaintiffs who were the junior members of the family had no kind of right or title to the inam lands except perhaps the right of maintenance and that too up to a certain degree and subject to its determination by the State. Accordingly the High Court held that defendant No. 1 Purushottam Rao, the inamdar for the time being, became the bhumiswami of the suit lands under section 158(1)(b) of the Code which constituted his separate property. The High Court however maintained the decree of the learned Additional District Judge with regard to partition and separation of the plaintiffs' share of immovable properties at Ujjain. The short and narrow question involved in this appeal is whether the inam lands which became bhumiswami lands under section 158(1)(b) of the Code were the self acquired property of the inamdar and defendant No. 1 Purushottam Rao was entitled to remain in full and exclusive possession and enjoyment thereof, or the conferral of bhumiswami rights in respect of such inam lands on him must enure to the benefit of the members of the joint Hindu family and therefore the bhumiswami lands were liable to be partitioned like any other coparcenary property. It is common ground that the inam lands were impartible, the succession to which was governed by the rule of lineal primogeniture. That must be so because the Jagir Manual of the Holkar State by r. 134 provides that the rule which refers to jagirs will apply to inams also except to the extent modified by any Darbar Order or circular. Chapter II, r. 2 provides: '2. A Jagir grant shall be indivisible and impartible property.' R. 3 provides for the rule of lineal primogeniture and it follows: '3. Every Jagir grant, which is not a purely lifegrant, shall descend in the order of primogeniture i.e. to the eldest male line of the last holder e.g. If a grantee has descendants as shown in the following pedigree table: A (Grantee) | | B C D | | | | | | G H I | | | | J E F | | | N | | K L M The Jagir will after A's death descend to B. After B it will descend to E to K.' Proviso to r.3 preserves the right of maintenance of the junior members of the family and it reads: 'Provided that the right of the members of the junior branches, claiming descent from the original grantee to a share in the income of the Jagir or maintenance according to the custom of the family or orders of the Government, shall not be affected thereby.' Although the original sanad granted to Abaji Ballal in 1837 is not forthcoming, the report of the Inam Commissioner discloses that the grant of inam to him was on Putra Pautradi Vanash Parampara condition by way of parvarish i.e. maintenance. Thus the grant of the inam lands was for maintenance of the members of the joint family and was also heritable. There is ample evidence on record to show that the inam lands although impartible were always treated by members of the family as part of the joint family properties and the succession to the inam was by the rule of survivorship as modified by the rule of lineal primogeniture. It is also clear that the junior members were in joint enjoyment of the inam lands and that was because the proviso to r. 3 expressly recognized their rights of maintenance. Further, the evidence shows that the properties acquired by the inamdar for the time being from out of the income of the inam such as the two houses at Indore and other properties were always dealt with as part of the joint family property. There is on record, an application for mutation made by defendant No. 1 Purushottam Rao on December 15, 1928 (exhibit P 6) wherein he had stated that his grand father had died on August 8, 1928 and therefore he prayed for substitution of the names of the legal heirs in the inam register, the material portion of which reads: 'I am his son's son i.e. his grandson and as such his heir. (A) Besides me the sons of my uncle i.e. (1) Krishna Rao (2) Anant Rao and (3) Govind Rao are also his heirs, Besides us no other person is his heir (A).' The prayer was that the names of all these heirs be substituted. There is also an affidavit of Purushottam Rao dated December 7, 1928 (exhibit P 5) regarding the death of his grand father Raghunath Rao and it mentions that he had three sons viz, Madhav Rao, Sadashiv Rao and Gopal Rao. It was averred that Madhav Rao who was the eldest had already expired leaving no issue and his wife had also died and that the whereabouts of Gopal Rao were not known since 3 1/2 or 4 years. It was stated that Gopal Rao had three sons viz. Krishna, Anant and Govind and all the three of them were minors. It then recites: 'All the three minor sons of Gopal Rao were living jointly with me.' Purushottam Rao examined as DW 24 has stated that the whereabouts of Gopal Rao were not known when his grand father Raghunath Rao was operated upon resulting in his death in the hospital. When confronted with portion marked 'AA' in exhibit P 6 he unequivocally admitted that he could not deny the statement made therein. He however went on to assent that the expenditure incurred by him on the plaintiffs by way of maintenance was not incurred by reason of their being the members of the joint family but because they had no resources of their own and it was necessary to give them maintenance allowance under the Inam Rules. It is quite apparent from the course of dealings that the inam lands at Kasba Indore and Mauja Palashiya Hana and other inam properties in the hands of the common ancestor Raghunath Rao which devolved upon defendant No. 1 Purushottam Rao were nothing but an ancestral impartible estate. Under the scheme of the Code there was a drastic change brought about not only in the nature of the tenure of inam lands but also in the mode of succession. S.158(1)(b) of the code provides: '158. Bhumiswami (1) Every person who at the time of coming into force of this Code, belongs to any of the following classes shall be called a Bhumiswami and shall have all the rights and be subject to all the liabilities conferred or imposed upon a Bhumiswami by or under this code, namely: (a) ** ** ** ** ** (b) every person in respect of land held by him in the Madhya Bharat region as a Pakka Tenant or as a Muafidar, Inamdar, or Concessional Holder, as defined in the Madhya Bharat Land Revenue and Tenancy Act, Samvat 2007(66 of 1950)'; The plain language of s.158(1)(b) effected a complete extinction of the inam rights followed by simultaneous conferral of bhumiswami rights. Every person, in respect of the land hold by him in the Madhya Bharat region as an inamdar, at the time of the coming into force of the code, became a bhumiswami thereof, and acquired all the rights and became subject to all the liabilities of a bhumiswami under the Code. The words 'in respect of land held by him' appearing in s.158(1)(b) refer to the status and character of the tenure holder in relation to the holding on the appointed day. The accrual of the status of bhumiswami by such person was automatic and he acquired all the rights and became subject to all the liabilities conferred or imposed upon a bhumiswami by or under the Code. As a necessary corollary, he became subject to the provisions of s.164. S.164 provides that subject to his personal law, the interests of a Bhumiswami shall, on his death, pass by inheritance, survivorship or bequest, as the case may be. On a combined reading of ss.158(1)(b) and 164, the legal consequence that ensued was that the incident of impartibility and the special mode of succession by the rule of primogeniture which were terms of the grant of inam lands under the Jagir Manual of the Holkar State, stood extinguished. After the conferment of bhumiswami rights, the incidents and character of the tenure became transformed and the restrictions placed thereon disappeared, and such lands became capable of being held in joint ownership like any other coparcenary property. It must logically follow that the conferral of bhumiswami rights on the holder for the time being under s.158(1)(b) of the Code in respect of ancestral inam lands must necessarily enure to the benefit of all the members of the joint family. In our judgment, the view expressed by the High Court that the inam lands and the two houses constructed at Indore and other properties acquired from out of the inam exclusively belonged to defendant No. 1 Purshottam Rao, the holder for the time being at the time when the Code was brought into force, can hardly be sustained. Since the decision of the Privy Council in Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kumari Debi and ors(1). it must taken as well settled that an estate which is impartible by custom cannot be said to be the separate or exclusive property of the holder of the estate. Where the property is ancestral and the holder has succeeded to it, it would be part of the joint estate of the undivided Hindu family. In the following illuminating passage Sir Dinshaw Mulla observes: 'The keynote of the whole position, in their Lord ships view, is to be found in the following passage in the judgment in the Tipperah(1) case: 'Where a custom is proved to exist, it supersedes the general law, which however, still regulates all beyond the custom.' 'Impartibility is essentially a creature of custom. In the case of ordinary joint family property, the members of the family have (1) the right of partition; (2) the right to restrain alienations by the head of the family except for necessity, (3) the right of maintenance and (4) the right of survivorship. The first of these rights cannot exist in the case of an impartible edate, though ancestral from the very nature of the estate. The second is incompatible with the custom of impartibility as laid down in Sartaj Kumari's case(2) and the first Pittapur case(3) and so also the third as held in the second Pittapur case(4). To this extent the general law of the Mitakshara has been superseded by custom, and the impartible estate though ancestral is clothed with the incidents of self acquired and separate property. But the right of survivorship is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibility. This right, therefore, still remains and this is what was held in Baijanth's case(6). To this extent the estate still retains its character of joint family property, and its devolution is governed by the general Mitakshara law applicable to such property. Though the other rights which a coparcener acquired by birth in joint family property no longer exist, the birthright of the senior member to take by survivorship still remains, Nor is this right a mere succession is similar to that of a reversioner succeeding on the death of a Hindu widow to her husband's estate. It is a right which is capable of being renounced and surrendered. Such being their Lordship's view, it follows that in order to establish that a family governed by the Mitakshara in which there is an impartible estate has ceased to be joint it is necessary to prove an intention, express or implied, on the part of the junior members of the family to renounce their right of succession to the estate.' The incidents of impartible estate laid down in Shiba Prasad Singh's case and the law there stated have been reaffirmed in the subsequent decisions of the Privy Council and of this Court. It is not necessary to refer to them as they have all been dealt with in a recent judgment of this Court in Nagesh Bisto Desai vs Khando Tirmal Desai(1). Impartibility is essentially a creature of custom. Here it is a term of the grant. The junior members of a joint family in the case of ancient impartible joint family estate take no right in the property by birth and therefore have no right of partition having regard to the very nature of the estate that it is impartible. The only incidence for joint property which still attaches to the joint family property is the right of survivorship which, of course, is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibility. The incident of impartibility attached to inam lands no longer exists by reason of s.158(1)(b) of the Code aa they have now become bhumiswami lands. The right of junior members of the family for maintenance is governed by custom and not based upon any joint right or interest in the property as owners. In case of inams in the Holkar State such right was again a condition of the grant. In view of the authorities cited in Nagesh Bisto Desai's case, supra, it must be held that the inam lands though impartible were nevertheless joint family properties of the parties. The impartibility of the tenure governed by the Jagir Manual of the Holkar State and the rule of lineal primogeniture governed by the Jagir Manual, Chapter II, rr.2 and 3 did not per se destroy its nature as joint family property or render it the separate property of the last holder so as to destroy the right of survivorship; the estate retained its character of joint family property and its devolution was governed by the rule of lineal primogeniture. To establish that a family governed by the Mitakshara in which there is an impartible estate has ceased to be joint, it is necessary to prove an intention, express or implied on the part of the junior members of the family to renounce their succession to the estate. The learned Additional District Judge during the course of his judgment has held on consideration of the evidence that there was no partition in the joint family as alleged by defendants 1 and 2 and that finding has not been reversed by the High Court in appeal. The learned Additional District Judge has referred to several well known decisions of the Privy Council dealing with the incidents of an impartible estate, including that of Shiba Prasad Singh's case, supra, but the High Court surprisingly did not refer to any one of them. He has also particularly referred to the nature and incidence of a protected thekedari under s.102 of the C.P. Land Revenue Act, 1917 and relied upon the decision of the Privy Council in Thakur Bhagwan Singh vs Darbar Singh '(1) and also to several decisions of the Nagpur and Madhya Pradesh High Courts and in particular to Mani Ram vs Ram Dayal(2) and Smt. Pilanoni Janakram vs Anandsingh Sakharam(3) where a similar question arose. He further felt that the principles laid down by the Bombay High Court in Lingappa Rayappa Desai vs Kadappa Bapurao Desai(4) dealing with the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 holding that watan lands stand in the same footing as ancestral impartible estate in a joint Hindu family passing by survivorship from one line to another according to primogeniture, must govern the case. The High Court declined to follow the long line of decisions of the Nagpur and Madhya Pradesh High Courts dealing with the protected the kedari tenure under section 109 of the C.P. Land Revenue Act, 1917 saying that they were 'inapplicable' to the case of jagir and inam properties which at no time were considered to be joint family properties but constituted a 'special kind of grant' regulated by the terms of the grant or the rules governing the same. It also declined to follow the decision of the Bombay High Court in Lingappa's case, supra, because it did not 'appeal' to the Court as it distinguished the decision of the Madras High Court in Sri Pavu Janardhana Krishna Ranga Rao Bahadur vs The State of Madras 'for reasons which did not appear to be sound'. It is difficult to sustain both on principle and precedent the view of the High Court that inam lands being impartible in nature, the succession to which was governed by the rule of lineal primogeniture, the two houses constructed at Indore and other properties acquired from out of the inam exclusively belonged to defendant No. 1 Purushottam Rao, the holder for the time being and constituted his separate property. In the former State of Madhya Pradesh, the existence of such and impartible tenure was not unknown. The nature and incidence of a protected thekedari tenure under s.109 of the C.P. Land Revenue Act, 1977 came up for consideration before the Privy Council in Bhagwan Singh's case, supra. The Privy Council observed that though the tenure of a protected thekedari was impartible and descended by primogeniture and was made inalienable, and it was provided that only one person at a time shall be entitled to succeed to such status, at the same time: 'The Act recognises that leasehold interests, though impartible, may nevertheless be joint family property of the thekedar and his family.' This was in consonance with the view expressed by Sir Bipin Krishna Bose, Addl. J.C. in Fagwa vs Budhram(1) that the grant of a protected thekedari tenure to the eldest male member of a family did not make the property his separate property. In Narayan Prasad vs Laxman Prasad(2) J. Sen, J. hold that where protected thekedari rights in respect of a village were acquired out of joint family funds, the village would be joint family property and a member of the joint family would be entitled to a share in the theka and to be maintained out of it. In Chandanlal vs Pushkarraj(3), Kaushalendra Rao, J. speaking for the Court observed: 'It has always been the accepted view that the grant of protected status to a thekedar did not make the theka the exclusive property of the person on whom the protected status is conferred.' The learned Judge then referred to the decision of the Privy Council in Bhagwan Singh's case and rejected the contention that the conferral of the protected status on one of the members destroyed the pre existing rights of the other members of the family. In Sukhanboi & Anr. vs Ramsharan Doma Sao and Ors(4). Mudholkar, J. tried to draw a distinction between the present tights and future rights of the members of the family and held that while the junior members have future or contingent rights such as a right of survivorship, they have, apart from custom or relationship, no present rights as, for instance, a right to restrain alienation or to claim maintenance. The decision of Mudholkar J. in Sukhambai's case taking a narrow and restricted view of the rights of the members of a joint Hindu family to participate in the present enjoyment and management of a protected thekedari tenure was however reversed on appeal by B.P. Sinha, C.J. and Hidayatullah, J. in Shiv Prasad Sao vs Sukhan Bai (Letters Patent Appeal No. 19 of 1449 decided on December, 30, 1954) observing that if there was a family arrangement for the joint enjoyment of the theka in the past, it would bind not only the protected thekedar for the time being but the whole family and so long as the family arrangement is not rescinded by the family itself, it must continue. The learned Judges considering the implications of s.109(1)(a) of the Act observed: 'The conferral of protected status does not disturb the rights of the members inter se though they may not be recognised by the State. As between members the rights of any particular member under the arrangement must continue.' As regards the validity of arrangements made by the co sharers in a theka dividing the property between themselves for beneficial enjoyment of the thekedar, they said: 'From the year 1881 when all existing arrangements were to continue, down to this day when private partitions and family arrangements have been recognised as binding on the family, there is an underline/current of recognition of joint family status. Most of these villages, when they were acquired, belonged, to a joint family and the intention in conferring protection was not to disturb arrangements but to recognise one member as a Thekedar and to restrain transfers and impose impartibility and primogeniture. Even though the Act of 1917 enacted about private partitions and arrangements, the law was merely declaratory of family custom as is apparent from a perusal of the various Settlements Reports.' The learned Judges then added a word of caution: 'Under the C.P. Land Revenue Act, a protected status could be conferred not only upon Hindus but also upon Muslims and others. The rules of impartible estates as understood in Hindu law cannot, therefore, be made applicable and the analogy is apt to be misleading.' Similar question arose in Mani Ram vs Ram Dayal, supra, and Smt, Pilanoni Janakram vs Anandsingh Sakharam, supra. The decision in Mani Ram's case is of some importance. Here, T.C. Shrivastava, J. had to consider the impact of s.39(1) of the M.P. Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1951 which provided that where the proprietary rights held by a protected thekedar vest in the State under section 3, the Deputy Commissioner may reserve to such proprietor the rights of an occupancy tenant in the whole or part of the home farm land and shall determine the rent thereon. section 39(2) there of provided that any person becoming an occupancy tenant under sub s(1) shall be a tenant of the State. The contention on behalf of the protected thekedar who brought the suit was that by virtue of such settlement he became the full and exclusive tenant thereof. The learned Judge after referring to the decision of the Privy Council in Bhagwan Singh's case, supra, and the aforesaid decision of the High Court in Shiv Prasad Sao's case, supra, reiterated that although section 109(1)(a) of the C.P. Land Revenue Act, 1917 provided that protected thekedari rights would descend by the rule of primogeniture and the theka was impartible in nature, the rights of the other members of the joint Hindu family in the theka continued though they could not obtain a partition of the lands in the theka or claim to be in possession of any lands pertaining to the theka. He referred to the observations made in Shiv Prasad Sao's case set out above and observed that it was open to the protected thekedar to come to an arrangement with his co sharers to divide the lands attached to the theka and such a family arrangement would be binding on the co sharers. Repelling the contention based on section 39 (1) of that Act he held that after the abolition of the proprietary rights in 1950, the rights of protected thekedars had completely disappeared and the statutory bar of impartibility and inalienability removed and therefore the lands which were joint family lands subject to statutory restrictions assumed the character of normal joint family property free from the statutory restrictions. In Smt. Pilanoni's case, supra, K.L. Pandey, J. held that although under cl.(5) of the Sarangarh State Wazib ul erz there was no right of partition given to a thekedar gaontia, but it permitted joint and divided management of the bhogra lands attached to the theka among the members of the family and though the State had reserved to itself under cl.(15) the right to induct a new thekedar who became entitled to the entire bhogra lands in the village, the effect of the two provisions was that the State could not be bound by a partition effected among the members of the family by way or a family arrangement but it would be binding on the members or the family, including the new thekedar who may have succeeded to the status of a thekedar gaontia. As to the settlement of such bhogra lands with the thekedar in raiyati rights under s.54(1) of the M.P. Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1951, the Court held that such settlement must enure to the benefit of the bhogra holders under a family arrangement since the lands continued to be impressed with the character of being joint family property. The point in controversy really stands concluded by the recent decision of this Court in Nagesh Bisto Desai's case, supra. There, the question was whether the plaintiff being the holder for the time being of the Kundgol Deshgat estate which was an impartible estate, the succession to which was governed by the rule of lineal primogeniture, was entitled to remain in full and exclusive possession and enjoyment of the watan lands resumed under section 3(4) of the Bombay Pargana & Kulkarni Watans (Abolition) Act, 1950 and section 4 of the Bombay Merged Territories Miscellaneous Alienations Abolition Act, 1955 which had been regranted to him as an occupant thereof under sections 4 and 7 of the Acts respectively. It was held that the plaintiff's contention ran counter to the scheme of the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 and was against settled legal principles, and that the Watans Act was designed to preserve the pre existing rights of the members of the joint Hindu family. The submission based on the alleged impartibility of watan property and the applicability of the rule of lineal primogeniture regulating succession to the estate was rejected on the ground that it could not prevail as these being nothing more than the incidents of the watans stood abrogated by section 3(4) of the 1950 Act and section 4 of the 1955 Act. It was held that the effect of the non obstante clause in section 3(4) of the 1950 Act was to bring about a change in the tenure or character of the holding as watan lands but did not affect the other legal incidents of the property under the personal law and if the property belonged to the joint Hindu family, then the normal rights of the members of the family to ask for partition were not in any way affected and therefore the re grant of the lands to the watandar under section 4(1) of the 1959 Act and section 7 of the 1955 Act must ensure to the benefit of the entire joint Hindu family. That precisely is the position here. Although under the Bombay Pargana & Kulkarni Watans (Abolition) Act, 1950 and the Bombay Merged Territories Miscellaneous Alienations Abolition Act, 1955 there was at first an abolition of watans and resumption of watan lands, followed by re grant of such lands to the watandar as an occupant under the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, that hardly makes a difference in principle. The only difference is that under section 158(1)(b) of the M.P. Land Revenue Code, there was a simultaneous extinction of the inams resulting in conferral of bhumiswami rights on every person holding inam lands on the date on which the Code was brought into force. The result therefore is that the appeal must succeed and is allowed. The judgment and decree passed by the High Court are reversed and those of the learned Additional District Judge decreeing the plaintiff's suit for partition and separate possession of their half share in the properties described in Schedule 'A' to the plaint are restored. The decree shall be drawn in terms of the compromise arrived at. There shall be no order as to costs. N.V.K. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 766 of 1964. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order, dated September 19, 1963 of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeal No. 268 of 1963. section P. Sinha and Shaukat Husain, for the appellant. Niren De, Additional Solicitor General, K. C. Chawla and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Satyanarayana Raju, J. This appeal, by special leave, is against the judgment of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court which affirmed the judgment of a Single Judge of that Court. The facts giving rise to this appeal may be shortly stated as follows. The appellant had been in the service of North Eastern Railway holding the substantive post of Travelling Ticket Examiner. The post of Travelling Ticket Inspector, which is the next higher post, is a selection post. Selection is made by a Selection Board in accordance with the Promotion and Selection Rules (Non Gazetted) framed under para 158 of the Indian Railway Establishment Code, Volume I (hereinafter referred to as the rules). Every year, an assessment of the number of vacancies that are likely to occur during that year is made. The Chief Commercial Superintendent is the appointing authority for the posts of Ticket Inspectors. In accordance with r. 8(7), eligible staff, up to four times the number of anticipated vacancies, shall be called up for written and viva voce tests. After the examination and the interview, the Board prepares a panel and promotions are made from the said panel. In the year 1959, a Selection Board for preparing a panel for the ex Muzaffarpur region was constituted. There were, during that year, eight existing vacancies which were to be filled up immediately. In addition, a panel of six was required to be drawn up. It was also expected that there would be nine more vacancies on account of upgrading of posts but this did not actually materialise. But, due to an incorrect assessment of the anticipated number of vacancies, 92 persons were called up for examination, whereas 56 persons should have been called up for written and viva voce tests. There was a written examination on February 22, 1959 and March 31, 1959, and thereafter the Selection Board interviewed the candidates. As a result of the examination and the viva voce test, the Selection Board prepared a panel of fourteen persons and the appellant was given the twelfth rank in the panel. He was posted as officiating Travelling Ticket Inspector on or about July 28, 1960. The final list of persons brought on the panel was published in the Railway Gazette on January 1, 1961 and the appellant was shown at serial No. 13 in that panel. But a note was appended to the notification stating that the selection of the appellant and five others was provisional. By a letter, dated September 29, 1961, the Chief Commercial Superintendent, North Eastern Railway, Gorakhpur, under the orders of the General Manager, the prescribed authority, deleted the name of the appellant and five others who were shown at serial numbers 9 to 14 in the panel. On November 28, 1961, the appellant filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ of certiorari, impugning the validity of the order dated September 29, 1961 in and by which his name had been removed from the panel. He contended that the deletion of his name from the panel indefinitely postponed his right of promotion and therefore amounted to a reduction in rank. The respondents contested the petition. They averred that the name of the appellant was deleted from the panel in accordance with rules, that he had no subsisting right to the post merely by reason of the fact that his name was included in the panel, that the appellant and five other persons were called up for examination on an incorrect assessment of the number of vacancies. It was also contended for the respondents that the provisions of article 311 were not attracted. By judgment, dated March 14, 1963, the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant. He held that the deletion of the appellant's name from the panel did not amount to reduction in rank under article 311 and that therefore he was not entitled to the notice prescribed by that article. The learned Judge also held that the appellant had not established that the decision of the respondent amounted to a violation of any constitutional provision or statutory rule. The appellant preferred an appeal which was summarily dismissed by a Division Bench. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was also rejected. Thereupon, the appellant obtained special leave from this Court. In support of the appeal, it is contended for the appellant by Mr. section P. Sinha, that the deletion of the appellants name from the panel amounted to a reduction in rank and that the order was bad in law for the reason that the appellant was not given an opportunity to explain or defend himself before his name was deleted from the panel. Now, as has been explained by this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs The Union of India(1) the expressions 'dismissal', 'removal' or 'reduction in rank' are technical words taken from the service rules where they are used, to denote the three major categories of punishments. The question for determination is whether the deletion of the appellant's name from the panel amounts to a reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311. Mention has already been made of the fact that the panel was prepared under the rules. Rule 8 lays down the procedure to be followed by the Selection Board. Sub rule (7) of that rule reads: 'Eligible staff up to 4 times the number of anticipated vacancies as defined below shall be called up for written and/or viva voce test.' Under the above rule, eligible staff up to four times the number of anticipated vacancies should be called for written and viva voce test. The vacancies to be filled up were 8 and in addition a panel of 6 was required to be drawn up; thus for the 14 persons to be included in the panel, 56 eligible staff were to be called. On account of an incorrect assessment of the anticipated vacancies, 92 persons were called to take the promotion examination. The appellant's number in the eligible staff was after 56 and, but for the mistake, he would not have been called for the examination. Rule 11 Provides that panels for selection posts framed by a duly constituted Selection Board and approved by the competent authority shall not be cancelled or amended without reference to an authority next above the one that approved the panel. Now, the panel was prepared by the Chief Commercial Superintendent, Gorakhpur, who was subordinate to the General Manager, North Eastern Railway. The panel, as originally drawn, was subsequently amended by the Chief Commercial Superintendent under instructions from the General Manager. This was in accordance with rule 11. In the final list of the personnel included in the panel, the names of Sahai and Ramanand were included. The name of the first of them was included by reason of the fact that his marks were not correctly totaled up and the second was included by reason of the fact that he belonged to the Scheduled Caste. The complaint made by the appellant is that by reason of the inclusion of the said two persons in the final panel of Travelling Ticket Inspectors there was no post in which he could be kept and he was therefore reverted till another vacancy occurred, that by reason of the deletion of his name from the panel it would be necessary for him to appear before another Selection Board and until his name was again brought into the panel he would have no chance of being promoted to the post of Travelling Ticket Inspector. It is to be noted that in the panel prepared by the Selection Board the word 'provisional' was specifically noted against the name of the appellant which clearly shows that he did not acquire a right to the post. The deletion of his name from the panel therefore does not attract the provisions of article 311. If a civil servant has a right to a particular rank, then the very reduction from that rank will operate as a penalty, for he will then lose the emoluments and privileges of that rank. If, however, he has no right to the particular rank, his reduction from an officiating higher rank to his substantive lower rank will not ordinarily be a punishment: vide Dhingra's Case(1). It is no doubt true that in the said case it has been held that when reversion entails penal consequences, it would be reduction in rank, but the instant case is not one in which penal consequences have been visited on the appellant. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the decision of a Single Judge of the High Court of Calcutta as supporting his contention that the deletion of the appellant's name from the panel would amount to a reduction in rank. That decision is reported as Dineshwar vs Chief Commercial Superintendent, Eastern Railway(2). At p. 211, the learned Judge observed: 'The question is whether the striking of the petitioner's name from the panel, has affected his future right of promotion. In my opinion, the escapable conclusion is that it has so affected the petitioner. As I have mentioned above, promotion from Class III post to a Class II post is to be done according to the recommendations made by Selection Boards. Where there is such a list or a panel, then a person not in the list cannot hope to be promoted... It is implied, that in order to have a chance of promotion the petitioner would have to be in the selection list, that is to say, in the panel. But with regard to the second contention, viz., that the striking out of his name from the panel affected his chances of future promotion, it is a point of substance and must be upheld. What the authorities should have done before striking out the name of the petitioner from the panel was to give him an opportunity of showing cause as to why his name should not be struck off from the panel and the order could only be made after giving the petitioner an opportunity of being heard.' We are of opinion that this is not a correct statement of the law, in view of the decision of this Court in High Court, Calcutta vs Amal Kumar Roy(1). There the facts were these. The respondent was a Munsif in the West Bengal Civil Service (Judicial). When the cases of several Munsifs came up for consideration before the High Court for inclusion of names in the panel of officers to officiate as Subordinate Judges, the respondent's name was excluded. He was told by the Registrar of the Court, on a representation made by him, that the Court had decided to consider his case after a year. As the result of such exclusion, the respondent, who was then the senior most in the list of Munsifs, lost eight places in the cadre of Subordinate Judges before he was actually appointed to act as an Additional Subordinate Judge. He filed a suit praying that a declaration might be made that he occupied the same position in respect of seniority in the cadre of Subordinate Judges as he would have done if no supersession had taken place. His case, in substance, was that as a result of the High Court's order he was reduced by eight places in the list of Subordinate Judges, and that in law amounted to reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311(2) of the Constitution. This Court held at p. 453 as follows: 'In our opinion, there is no substance in this contention because losing places in the same cadre, namely, of Subordinate Judges does not amount to reduction in rank, within the meaning of article 311(2). The plaintiff sought to argue that 'rank', in accordance with dictionary meaning, signifies 'relative position or status or place'. According to Oxford English Dictionary, the word 'rank' can be and has been used in different senses in different contexts. The expression 'rank' in article 311(2) has reference to a person's classification and not his particular place in the same cadre in the hierarchy of the service to which he belongs. Hence, in the context of the Judicial Service of West Bengal, 'reduction in rank' would imply that a person who is already holding the post of a Subordinate Judge has been reduced to the position of a Munsif, the rank of a Subordinate Judge being higher than that of a Munsif. But Subordinate Judges in the same cadre hold the same rank, though they have to be listed in order of seniority in the Civil List. Therefore, losing some places in the seniority list is not tantamount to reduction in rank. Hence, it must be held that the provisions of article 311(2) of the Constitution are not attracted to this case.' This decision has established the following principle, viz., the expression 'rank' in article 311(2) has reference to a person's classification and not his particular place in the same cadre in the hierarchy of the service to which he belongs and therefore losing some places in the seniority list is not tantamount to reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311(2) of the Constitution. It is perhaps true that the hopes of the appellant were raised by reason of the inclusion of his name in the panel. It is also true that the respondent made an incorrect assessment of the anticipated number of vacancies, but the fact remains that his inclusion in the panel was expressly stated to be provisional. The appellant cannot therefore complain of any infraction of the guarantee given by the Constitution to Government servants. The appeal fails and is dismissed. In all the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 1527 of 1974. Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment & Order dated the 14th December, 1973 of the Delhi High Court in Civil Writ No. 1678 of 1967. F. section Nariman, Addl. Gen. of India, D. N. Mukherjee and R. N. Sahthey, for the Appellants. N. A. Palkhiala, Ravinder Narain, J. B. Dadachanji, O. C. Mathur, K. J. John and K. R. Jhaveri, for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Goswami, J. This appeal is by special leave from the judgment of the Delhi High Court in a writ application there under article 226 of the Constitution. The respondent manufactures various other items hot rolled finished steel products in rectangular cross section of thickness varying between 1.7 mm and 6.55 mm and width varying between 16.2 mm and 311.2 mm and rolled in coils which it supplies to the Indian Tube Company Limited at Jamshedpur for making tubes and also to others. This article is subjected to Central Excise Duty under the (hereinafter called the Act). The dispute between the respondent and the appellants is that while the former describes the said manufactured product as strip the appellants classify it as skelp. This difference in classifying the product differently results in fiscal misfortune to the respondent since skelp is subjected to a higher Central Excise Duty than strip. It may be stated that during the period from April 24, 1962 to February 28, 1964, the respondent described its product as skelp and it was subjected then to a lower rate of duty. From February 19, 1964, the respondent claimed that the aforesaid product be classified as strip since there had been a levy of higher duty for skelp. The Assistant Collector, Central Excise, Jamshedpur, who is the primary taxing authority, the Collector of Central Excise, Patna, in appeal, and the Central Government in revision rejected the contention of the respondent by successive orders, each authority upon its own test of the definition of the product as skelp. That led to the successful writ application of the respondent in the High Court resulting in this appeal. In the forefront of his argument the learned Additional Solicitor General for the appellants relying upon two decisions of this Court, namely, The Collector of Customs, Madras vs K. Ganga Setty and V. V. Iyer of Bombay vs Jasjit Singh, Collector of Customs and Another, submitted that 'it is primarily for the taxing authorities to determine the heads or entry under which any particular commodity fell; but that if in doing so, these authorities adopted a construction which no reasonable person could adopt i.e., if the construction was perverse then it was a case in which the Court was competent to interfere. In other words, if there were two constructions which an entry could reasonably bear, and one of them which was in favour of Revenue was adopted, the Court has no jurisdiction to interfere merely because the other interpretation favourable to the subject appeals to the Court as the better one to adopt'. On the other hand with equal emphasis Mr. Palkhivala for the respondent submitted that an assessment without the application of an identifiable test is nothing but perverse and arbitrary. He submits that in the present case there was no identifiable test before the taxing authorities by which the respondent could be held to be skelp and not strip subjecting the respondent to a heavier duty. According to the learned counsel there is no difference between skelp and strip, the two items being interchangeable. It may be noted for our purpose that under section 3 of the Act Central excise Duties are leviable on all excisable goods which are produced or manufactured in India at the rates set out in the First Schedule. Item No. 26AA in that Schedule relates to iron and steel products and mentions in sub item (iii) therein flats, skelp and strips showing the rate of duty in the third column. Under rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, made under section 37 of the Act, the Central Government may from time to time by notification in the official gazette exempt, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the notification, any excisable goods from whole or any part of the duty leviable on such goods. In exercise of the power under this rule the Central Government has made such exemptions in the rates of duty as have made it higher on skelp than on strip. Before we proceed further we may notice how the various Excise authorities dealt with the matter at different stages. The first order is that of the Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Jamshedpur, which was on June 17, 1964. According to him 'skelp is the name used in reference to a plate of wrought iron or steel used for making pipe or tubing by rolling the skelp into shape and lap welding or brevetting edges together and strip is a term used to describe a flat rolled product of smaller cross section than sheet or bar.' He accordingly adopted the definition given in Marymen's Dictionary of Metallurgy. The order of the Collector of Central Excise in appeal made on October 24/29, 1964, shows that the authority noted the definition of strip as follows: 'Hot or cold rolled finished steel product in rectangular cross section of thickness below 5 mm and of width below 800 mm and supplied in straight length'. This definition is substantially in conformity with the one given by the Indian Standards Institution (ISI). The appellate authority held that 'since the products have not satisfied the above specifications, they have been correctly classified as 'skelp' by the Assistant Collector. Then comes the order in revision of the Central Government of August 18, 1967. Inter alia it was held that 'the product does have bevel edge, peculiar to skelp and not found in strips. Under the circumstances, there is no doubt whatever that the product in question is correctly classified as skelp'. From the above three orders it is clear that the authorities were not at all certain about a uniform definition of 'skelp' distinguishing it from 'strip. Extensive arguments were advanced at the bar with regard to the definitions of these two words. We may, therefore, look at the various definitions to which our attention has been drawn.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 178 of 1967. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 5, 1967 of the Madras High Court in Criminal Appeal Nos. 34 to 38 of 1965. R. N. Sachthey, for the appellant. H. R. Gokhale, M. K. Ramamurthi, Vineet Kumar and Shyamala Pappu, for respondent No. 1. A. V. Rangam, for respondent No. 6. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Dua, J. A complaint under section 6 of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1947 dated 24th February, 1964 was presented by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, New Delhi in the court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Madras against (1) K. T. Kosalram, Director in charge of Messrs Dina Seithi Ltd., Madras, (2) K. T. Janakiram, Director, Messrs Dina Seithi Ltd., (3) K. Natarajan, Manager, Messrs Mohan Ram Press, Madras, (4) Messrs Dina Seithi Ltd., Madras, (5) Sri T. N. Ramachandran son of section Natesa lyer, Madras and (6) T. Natarajan, Manager, Messrs Dina Seithi Ltd., Madras. According to the broad allegations in the complaint, on November 28, 1959 accused No. 4 (hereafter called the Company) was registered under the , as a public limited company with the Registrar of Companies, Madras. Accused nos. 1 and 2 who are brothers were both directors of the Company, accused No. 1 being the Director in charge attending to its day to day management and administration. He was also authorised to operate its accounts with the banks. The primary object of the Company was publication of a Tamil daily newspaper 'Dina Seithi'. Accused No. 3 was the Manager of Messrs Mohan Ram Press located in the same building in which the Company was located. Srimati Gomati Devi, wife of accused No. 1 was the sole proprietress of this Press. She had given power of attorney to her husband for operating the bank account of her Press. The daily newspaper (Dina Seithi) used to be printed at this press. Accused No. 5 was a broker engaged in the business of negotiating sale and purchase of printing machinery. Between 1949 and 1951 he was working as Chief Salesman of Printers ' House, Madras and before that for about two years he had worked as a salesman with Messrs Standard Printing Machinery Company, Madras. In 1951 he started his independent business as a broker; in addition he also used to work as a correspondent of 'Kerala Kaumudi' belonging to the Company. Accused No. 6 was the Manager of the Company and his wife Smt. Sarojini was one of its Directors. On May 5, 1960 accused No. 1 applied on behalf of the Company to the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, New Delhi, for the grant of an import licence in favour of the Company for importing two secondhand rotary printing presses valued at Rs. 3 lakhs in the category of 'Actual Users'. The Chief Controller of Imports & Exports, on the recommendation of the Committee constituted for the purpose, issued in the first instance aft import licence for Rs. 1,50,000 (exhibit P 12). The number of this licence was A 759626/60/AU/CCI/HO and it was dated September 19, 1960. Later, on the request of accused No. 2 on behalf of the Company, the value of this licence was raised to Rs. 3 lakhs on the recommendation of the Press Registrar of India. The licence was returned to the Company on December 16, 1960. The original period of validity of the licence having expired on June 19, 1961 accused No. 2 requested the Licensing Authority on behalf of the Company to extend the period on the ground that the machinery could not be fixed up by the Company 's Directors. Under the orders of the Controller in charge of the newsprint sale, the validity of the licence was extended upto March 19, 1962. Oil July 2, 1961 accused No. 1 sought permission of the Licensing Authority on behalf of the Company to import two secondhand rotary presses instead of one already permitted within the licence value of Rs. 3 lakhs under the import 51 1 licence exhibit P/12 on the ground that one more printing press was required for the proposed office at Madurai (exhibit P/15). After securing further necessary information about the machinery proposed to be imported the Chief Controller approved the request with the result that the amended licence for two presses was sent to the Company, on August 16, 1961. On December 19, 1961 the Company as per letter sent by accused No. 1, informed the Chief Controller that one rotary printing press had been imported and the other was expected to arrive by January, 1962. It was requested that in the import licence the description of the goods be changed from 'Rotary Press' to 'Rotary Press with Stereo equipment and Turtles'. We find from exhibit P/17 and exhibit P/17(a) that it was represented that the Company was incurring heavy demurrage as the cases were lying on the wharf uncleared for want of the required amendment of the licence. This was described as a purely technical amendment in the licence. This request was granted with the approval of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports. The amended licence was despatched to, the Company on January 3, 1962. According to condition (c) reproduced on the reverse of the import licence the licence holder had to utilise the goods imported only for consumption in his own factory and its sale to or use by other parties was specifically prohibited. The licence holder was further prohibited from pledging the imported goods in whole or in part except with a scheduled bank duly authorised to deal in foreign exchange and that also with prior permission of the Licensing Authority. One Dr. K. G. Thomas owned 'Kerala Dhwani', a daily newspaper of Kottayam having circulation in the State of Kerala. It has started on August 20, 1959 and C. J. Mani was its general business manager ever since its inception. On November 10, 1960 Dr. Thomas applied to the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports on behalf of his firm for importing a rotary printing press under a Customs Clearance Permit. But this was rejected. On October 25, 1961 he sent another application dated October 3, 1961 on behalf of ,the firm requesting for an import licence for importing a secondhand rotary press for the period October March, 1962. But this was also rejected. Still another application dated May 10, 1962 for licence for importing two mono typefacing units was also rejected on April 29, 1963. C. J. Mani, the General Manager of this concern was also independently trying to secure a rotary printing press through various parties and firms. Accused No. 5 was known to C. J. Mani and during the former 's visit to Kottayam in the first quarter of 1961 he learnt that Dr. Thomas was desirous of securing a secondhand rotary printing press. Sometime in April or May, 1961 accused nos. 2 and 5 visited Kottayam and on meeting Dr. Thomas they told him that accused No. 1 was going to have an import licence for two rotary printing presses but he needed only one, with the result that one R. Hoe & Co eight page rotary printing press would be available for sale. After some correspondence and discussion between accused No. 5 and C. J. Mani and Dr. Thomas and after a personal meeting between Dr. Thomas and accused No. 1 (at the instance of accused No. 5) the terms of sale of rotary press to Dr. Thomas were finalised on July 17, 1961. The price was settled at Rs. 2 lakhs ex godown, Madras, The same day Dr. Thomas paid to accused No. 5 Rs. 15,000 by means of a cheque by way of advance money. Accused No. 5 issued a stamped receipt which was also signed by accused No. 1. On July 19, 1961 the photo prints of the press offered for sale were forwarded by accused No. 5 to Dr. Thomas. On the reverse of these prints were the rubber stamp impressions of the Company. On August 2, 1961 a further sum of Rs. 25,000 was paid by Dr. Thomas for which a receipt was given by accused nos. 1 and 5. Between September 23, 1961 and March 17, 1962 the balance of Rs. 1,76,700 (total being Rs. 2,16,700) was paid by Dr. Thomas in instalments towards the price of the rotary press and its accessories. On September 1, 1961 accused No. 1 had 'opened a letter of credit with a nil margin with the Indian Overseas Bank Ltd., Madras on Messrs Universal Printing Equipment Company, ,New York for importing a secondhand rotary press for dollars equivalent to Rs. 1,00, 1 12 against import licence No. A 759626/ 60/AU/CCI/HQ. On October 28, 1961, the Bank received the relevant import documents and on December 13, 1961 it received from the Company the remittance of the amount in cash towards the letter of credit. On October 20, 1961 Messrs Binny & Co., Madras, the agents of the ' Shipping Company Messrs Isthmian Lines Inc., U. section A. had requested the Company to remit Rs. 12,712 being the freight payable at Madras towards the con signment of 19 boxes containing secondhand rotary press due to arrive from New York by s.s. 'Steel Vendor' so as to enable them to cable to their principals at New York to issue the bills of leding to the shippers. A cheque for Rs. 12,712 was accordingly sent by the Company to Messrs Binny & Co., on October 31, 1961. The necessary cable was then sent to New York. The import documents pertaining to the rotary press were sent by accused No. 1 on behalf of the Company to Messrs Natesa lyer & Co., Clearing Agents, Madras for clearing the goods from the Madras Port by the Indian Overseas Bank Ltd., Pursawalakam, Madras. This invoice was issued by the Universal Printing Equipment Company, Lindhurst in the name of Messrs Dina Seithi Ltd., indicating shipment of the goods imported contained in the 19 boxes bearing marks 'Dina Seithi'. The customs duty and the clearance charges were paid by the Company. It is unnecessary to state at length further details of the complaint. Suffice it to 513 started functioning from May 20, 1962. In March, 1962 the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Madras, visited the premises of this newspaper and found the rotary printing Press tallying with the description given in the invoice issued to the Company by R. Hoe & Co., New York/London. The number 458 assigned to the press was also found on its major parts. No rotary press imported by accused No. 1 on behalf of the Company was found at its (the Company 's) premises. The amount received by cheques and drafts from Dr. Thomas were credited to the account of Messrs Mohan Ram Press of which Smt. Gomati Devi, wife of accused No. 1, was the sole proprietress. On these broad avermerits it was prayed in the complaint that accused nos. 1 to 3 and 5 and 6 be proceeded against for offences under section 120 B, I.P.C. read with section 5 of Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 ' Lind also for an offence under section 5 of the said Act. The Company was alleged to be guilty under section 5 of the said Act read with cl. (5), sub cl. (iv) of Imports (Control) Order, 1955. The Chief Presidency Magistrate who tried the complaint acquitted accused No. 6 holding that he had nothing to do with the impugned transaction but convicted the rest. The Company was sentenced to fine only and so were accused nos. 2, 3 and 5; three individual accused persons were directed, in case of default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months on each count. Leniency was shown to accused nos. 2, 3 and 5 because they had acted under the directions given by accused No. 1 who was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six months under each count and also to pay fine and in default to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for three months. The convicted accused appealed to the High Court at Madras and the State applied for enhancement of sentences. The, High Court acquitted all the accused persons with the result that the revision for enhancement necessarily failed. The High Court having declined certificate of fitness under article 1 3 4 ( 1 ) (c) of the Constitution the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports & Exports secured special leave to appeal under article 136 of the Constitution against the order of acquittal by the High, Court. In the High Court, though in the memorandum of appeal several grounds were taken, during arguments the appellant 's counsel confined his submission mainly to the point that condition. (c) of the licence issued to accused No. 4 (exhibit P/ 1 2) related only to raw material or accessories and that as such the sale of printing press which was neither raw material nor accessories, did not contravene that clause. The factum of sale of the printing press, 514 to Dr. Thomas (P. W. 16) was not disputed. The High Court accepting this contention held condition (c) in exhibit P/12 to be inapplicable to printing presses and observed that the Licensing Authority had not applied its mind when this condition was inserted in the licence for importing the printing press in question. On this ground the conviction recorded by the trial court was set aside. The appellant 's learned counsel in this Court has questioned the correctness of this view and has submitted that it is not sustainable on the statutory provisions and has resulted in grave failure of justice. Before dealing with this question we may dispose of a pre liminary objection to the competency of this appeal at the instance of the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, raised by Shri H. R. Gokhale on behalf of the respondents. It has been pointed out that the special leave petition in this Court purports to be filed by the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports & Exports and not by the State. As the State had conducted the prosecution the complainant, it is argued, cannot seek leave nor can he prosecute this appeal. Leave already granted ex parte is, according, to Shri Gokhale liable to be revoked. Reliance has been placed on Management of Hindustan Commercial Bank Ltd., Kanpur vs Bhagwandass(1). There the appellant had secured from this Court ex parte special leave to appeal under article 136 of the Constitution without first moving the High Court for the necessary certificate and this Court, on objection by the respondent, revoked the special leave as being in contravention of O. 13, r. 2 of the Supreme Court Rules. The respondents ' contention before us is that the Public Prosecutor and not the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports & Exports had applied to the High Court for the necessary certificate and, therefore, the Deputy Chief Controller has no locus standi to apply for special leave. Having been granted on an incompetent petition the special leave deserves to be revoked, argues Shri Gokhale. We are unable to uphold this objection. The complaint was filed in the court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate by the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports under section 6 of the Imports and Exports (Control Act, 1947. It is not disputed that this officer was, as stated in para 1 of the complaint, duly authorised to make the complaint within the contemplation of section 6. In the appeals filed by the accused against their conviction the State was impleaded, as represented by the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports (complainant), as the respondent. It is true that in a petition for enhancement of sentence filed in the High Court the Public Prosecutor was shown as the petitioner and similarly the application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the High Court was (1) ; 515 also filed in that Court by the Public Prosecutor. But that, in our view, does not in any way disentitle the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports (the original complainant duly authorised by the statute) to apply for special leave to appeal to this Court and to prosecute the appeal. , Our attention has not been drawn to any provision of law which can be said to deprive the Deputy Chief Controller the lawfully authorised complainant in this case to seek special leave and prosecute this appeal. In any event article 136 of the Constitution and the Supreme Court Rules are wide enough in their language to empower this Court to grant special leave to the Deputy Chief Controller in cases like the present and deal with the appeal on the merits. The preliminary objection must accordingly be repelled. Coming to the merits we may for a while again turn to con dition (c) of the licence which has already been noticed earlier. It may be recalled that this condition expressly provides that the goods would be utilised only for consumption as raw material or accessories in the licence holder 's factory and no portion thereof would be sold to, or, be permitted to be utilised by, any other party. The goods imported are also not to be pledged with any financier other than banks authorised to deal in foreign exchange, provided that particulars of the goods so pledged are reported in advance to the licensing authority. Under section 3 of the Imports and Exports Act , 18 of 1947 the Central Government is empowered to provide by order published in the official Gazette for prohibiting, restricting or otherwise controlling the import, export, carriage or shipment etc., of goods of any specified description and also the bringing into any port or place in India of goods of any specified description intended to be taken out of India without being removed from the ship or conveyance in which they are being carried. The Central Government by Order dated December 7, 1955 made the Import Control Order under sections 3 and 4A of the said Act. Clause (3) of this Order provides for restriction on import of certain goods in these words : 'Save as otherwise provided in this Order, no person shall import any goods of the description specified in Schedule 1, except under, and in accordance with, a licence or a customs clearance permit granted by the Central Government or by any officer specified in Schedule II.' Clause 7 of this Order empowers the Licensing Authority suo motu or on application by the licensee to amend the licences granted under this Order in such manner as may be necessary to make them conform to the aforesaid Act or this Order or any other law in force or to rectify any error or omission in the licence : on the licensee 's request, however, the licence may be 5 1 6 amended in any manner consonant with the Import and Export Control Regulations. Item No. 67(1) in Schedule 1, Part V, which appears to us to be relevant for this case reads : 'Printing and Lithographic material, namely, presses, lithographic plates, composing sticks, chases, imposing tables, lithographic stones, stero blocks, wood blocks, half tone blocks, electrotype blocks, process blocks, roller moulds, roller frames and stocks, roller composition, lithographic nap rollers, standing screw and hot presses, perforating machines, gold blocking presses, galley presses, proof presses, arming presses, copper plate printing presses, rolling presses, ruling machines, ruling pen making machines, lead cutters, rule cutters, slug cutters, type casting machines, type setting and casting machines, paper in rolls with side perforations to be used after further perforation for typecasting, rule bending machines, rule mitreing machines, bronzing machines, stereotyping apparatus, paper fold ing machines, paging machines, but excluding ink and paper and sets of mats when imported as advertising material in connection with composed films.' This item which contains a very large number of various components of a printing press corresponds to item No. 72(2) of the Indian Tariff Act, 1934 which consolidates the law relating to customs duties. Item No. 67(2) in Schedule I speaks of component parts as defined in import tariff item No. 72(3), of machinery specified in cl. (1) excluding those covered by sl. no 6 8 of this schedule. Serial No. 68 refers to rubber blankets for printing presses etc. Item No. 67 (1) would suggest that printing presses are included in the expression 'printing and lithographic material.' Our attention has not been drawn to any other entry either in Schedule I of the Imports Control Order or in the first Schedule of the Indian Tariff Act which would cover the import of printing presses and payment of customs duty on such import. These two statutes forming parts of the Import Control Scheme may appropriately be considered as throwing some light on each other. The principal argument advanced on behalf of the respondents is that cl. (c) of the conditions of the licence does not cover the printing presses in question because the plain language of this clause postulates that goods covered by it should be capable of being utilised for consumption as raw material or accessory in a factory. A complete printing press, it is contended, is neither raw material nor accessories and it cannot be said that by fixing a printing press for running it, the press is utilised for consumption as raw material or accessory. This argument, though attractive on first impression seems to us on a deeper thought to 517 be unacceptable. A close scrutiny of the scheme and language of the relevant provisions of the import and export legislation and of the Import Control Policy formulated by the Government leaves no doubt that the argument is unfounded. Clause (c) reads : ' (c) The goods will be utilised only for con sumption as raw materials or accessories in the licence holders ' factory and that no portion thereof will be sold to or be permitted to be utilised by any other party or pledged with any financier other than Banks authorised to deal in foreign exchange provided that particulars of goods so pledged are reported in advance to the licensing authority.' The respondents have sought assistance for their argument principally from the dictionary meaning of the words 'consumption', 'raw material' and 'utilised' used in this clause. 'Consumption', it is argued, conveys the idea of destruction of the commodity consumed and 'raw material' according to this submission, must be 'utilised' in this sense. In our opinion dictionary meanings, however helpful in understanding the general sense of the words cannot control where the scheme of the statute or the instrument considered as a whole clearly conveys a somewhat different shade of meaning. It is not always a safe way to construe a statute or a contract by dividing it by a process of etymological dissection and after separating words from their context to give each word some particular definition given by lexicographers and then to reconstruct the instrument upon the basis of those definitions. What particular meaning should be attached to words and phrases in a given instrument is usually to be gathered ?from the context, the nature of the subject matter, the purpose or the intention of the author and the effect of giving to them one or the other permissible meaning on the object to be achieved. Words are after all used merely as a vehicle to convey the idea of the speaker or the writer and the words have naturally, therefore, to be so construed as to fit in with the idea which emerges on a consideration of the entire context. Each word is but a symbol which may stand for one or a number of objects. The context, in which a word con veying different shades of meanings is used, is of importance in determining the precise sense which fits in with the context as intended to be conveyed by the author. The words used in the licence (exhibit P/12) have accordingly to be construed in the background of the scheme of the Import Control Order, 1955, the entry No. 67 of Schedule I to this Order and the Import Trade Control Policy. The word 'consumption' as used in cl. (c) in the licence seems to us to convey the idea of using up the goods by L 436 Sup Cl/71 518 fixing them in the factory along with other components. This is clear from the fact that entry No. 67(1) in Schedule 1 of the Import Control Order does not contain any single item denoting a complete printing press and from the fact that the various ;articles mentioned in this item seem as if to have been intended to constitute 'raw material'. This construction fits in with the scheme and policy of the Import Trade Control as we will presently show. The dictionary meaning of the three words in cl. (c) on which the respondent relies also seems, in our opinion to harmo nise with this view. The Government of India (Ministry of Commerce and Industry) has been publishing from time to time Import Trade Control Handbook on rules and procedure providing for the assistance of those interested in imports up to date information as to the manner in which applications for import licences should be made, the appropriate authority to be addressed in each case, the procedure governing the grant of licences for different classes of goods, the validity and use of import licences and other similar matters. In the Handbook of 1956, which is the relevant Handbook for this case which relates to the licence originally granted in 1960, Schedule I commonly known as the ITC Schedule serves broadly to classify the articles that enter into the import trade. Part V of the Schedule covers 'industrial requirements and it is in this part that the printing and lithographic material including and Other items are entered at sl. No. 67(1), already noticed by us. This Handbook emphasises the importance of correct classification with reference to the serial number and part of the ITC Schedule. In Appendix III of the Handbook application forms are prescribed. Form B is the one which was used by the respondents. This form is meant for the import of goods by actual users not borne on the registers maintained by the Industrial Advisers, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, when licence is sought for import of goods (other than those falling under the capital goods licensing procedure) vide : Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry Order No. 17/55 dated 7th December, 1955. It is expressly stated in the respondents ' application exhibit P/ 11 (b) 1 that the raw material was required by them for printing newspaper (Dina Seithi, Tamil Daily) : full particulars of the raw materials required to be imported were given as printing machinery and proforma was attached with the application. ITC number and part was specifically stated to be 67 (1 ) (i), Part V. It was on the basis of this application that the licence exhibit P/12 was granted subject inter alia to condition (c). The Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry also publishes from time to time Import Trade Control Policy 519 for the various licensing periods. in the publication for the licensing period April September, 1960 we find the policy statement, showing the list of items licensable to actual users. At p. 360 in Appendix IV, Part V, items 67 (1) (i) and 67 (2) occur. Item 67 (1 ) (i) reads : 'Printing machinery (for Newspaper Establishments and quality printers).' Item 67 (2) reads : 'Component parts of printing machinery'. It is obvious that in the respondents ' application serial No. 67(1) (i) refers to this item in the Import Trade Control Policy, AprilSeptember, 1960, the period relevant for this case. There is no other item in any one of the lists which covers printing presses as a separate item. This clearly shows that the printing presses are treated by legislative intendment as Printing material or Printing machinery. Form 'B ' used in the present case indicates that the Press intended to be imported was not considered to fall under the Capital Goods Licensing Procedure. It seems that it is for all these reasons that in the licence it was provided that these goods would be utilised only for consumption as raw material or accessories in the licence holder 's factory. The words 'utilised', 'consumption' and 'raw material' have to be fitted into the clearly discernable statutory scheme and this is possible without doing violence to the dictionary meaning of these words. The appropriate dictionary meaning of words possessing variable shades of meanings has not to be arbitrarily selected and mechanically applied without considering the setting in which they are, used and the purpose sought to be achieved. There is another very cogent factor in this case, namely, that the respondents, when they sought licence for the import of printing press expressly represented that the imported goods were required to meet the increasing demand of circulation of their newspaper. This indeed was the sole round for importing the press. The amended licence was. also secured by the respondents so as to enable them to import two printing presses on the ground that one press was required for their Madurai office as well. Licence for both the printing presses was obtained for actual use by them for their newspapers. Had they not complied with the procedure meant for the import of goods by actual users, they might not have secured the necessary licence. Having secured a licence expressly for the import of goods for their use they may not be permitted to ignore the condition of actual user on the plea (which by no means seems to be virtuous) that cl. (c) is inapplicable to actual users. 5 20 The respondents on their own showing clearly knew their dis ability under the conditions imposed by cl. (c) of the licence. Knowing full well the condition prohibiting the transfer of the press to other persons the respondents as the correspondence to which our attention has been drawn shows were actually negotiating for the sale of one of the presses during the period when the procedure in regard to its import was being carried out. On July 2, 1961 amendment of the licence was sought so as to import one more printing press and on July 17, 1961 its resale was actually finalised and a part of the price also received. These facts do not need any comment on the intention and bona fides of the respondents. It is unnecessary to go into the evidence on this point because, as already noticed, it is not disputed that one of the printing presses was actually sold to Dr. Thomas prior to its arrival in India. The amendment of the licence also appears to have been sought with the object of reselling the second press. The only argument urged namely that condition (c) was inapplicable to the present case having been repelled, the appeal, in our view, must succeed and the order of the High Court reversed. The validity of condition (c) in the licence has not been questioned and in our opinion rightly in view of the decision of this Court in M/s. Ramchand Jagdish Chand vs Union of India(1). There is neither any legal nor equitable justification for reselling the printing press. The suggestion faintly thrown that the Company was the holder of the licence and, therefore, the other respondents (accused persons) should not be held liable is also without merit. On the facts found and on the authority of State of West Bengal vs Motilal Kanoria (2 ) all the respondents (the individual accused persons along with the Company) are guilty. The argument that the High Court having acquitted the,res pondents on a possible view this Court should not convert acquittal into conviction under article 136 of the Constitution has not appealed to us. The view of the High Court does not seem to be sustainable on the statutory language and on the Import Control Policy of which the respondents were fully aware. Their own application is proof positive of their awareness of the true position and the breach of the conditions of the licence on their part was deliberate. Indeed, as observed earlier, the permission for the import of the second press was apparently sought with the object of its resale. Breach of conditions for import of goods is a serious matter because it prejudicially affects our country 's national economy. The import licence for the second press having, in our view, been sought on false representation with (1) ; (2) [1966] 3 section C. R. 933. 521 the object and purpose of its resale the breach of the licence was, therefore, fully intended and designed. The respondents are guilty of malpractices and of abuse of the import licence with the object of making money. We, however, think that in view of the fact that this litigation has been pending since a long time, it would meet the ends of justice if we impose merely fine and do not sentence anyone to imprisonment. The final result is that the order of the High Court is set aside and accused nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 are convicted under section 120 B, I.P.C. and section 5 of the Imports & Exports Act, 1947 read with cl. 5 of the Import Control Order, 1955 and each of the accused nos. 2, 3 and 5 are sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/ under each count. Accused No. 1 who is the principal culprit and who was sen tenced by the trial court to imprisonment and fine is sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/ under each count. In default of payment of fine the defaulting accused persons will undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. The Company is convicted only under section 5 of the Imports & Exports Act read with cl. 5 of the Import Control Order and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/ . V.P.S. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 2481 of 1978. Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 10 10 67 of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Civil First Appeal No 18 of 1966 Lal Narain Sinha, E. C. Agarwala, M. M. L. Srivastava, R. Satish and Altaf Ahmed for the Appellant. section N. Andley, B. P. Maheshwari and Suresh Sethi for the Respondent The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J. This is a plaintiffs ' appeal by special leave against a judgment dated 10th October, 1966 of the Jammu & Kashmir High Court dismissing the plaintiff 's suit. 4 The facts of the case lie within a very narrow compass and after hearing counsel for the parties we propose to decide only one point, viz., the question as to whether or not the plaintiffs were entitled to a decree of ejectment against the defendants in respect of the house in question on the ground of personal necessity, and, therefore, we shall narrate only those facts which are germane for this purpose. The property in suit was a four storeyed building situated at Maisuma Lal Chowk, Srinagar and belonged to one Peer Ali Mohammad, the ancestor of the plaintiffs. This building was leased out to the defendants by a registered lease deed dated 1st December 1947 for a period of 10 years. Under the lease the lessor had provided some furniture and crockery to the lessees. Furthermore, it was clearly stipulated that the building was leased out for the purpose of running a hotel by the lessees, and for this purpose the lessees were given the right to make suitable alterations in the same, but were prohibited from making any alteration which may affect the durability or damage the building. On the expiry of the period of the lease, the appellants demanded possession of the building from the respondents and despite certain notices given by the appellants the respondents failed to give possession of the building. Hence the plaintiff 's suit. The plaintiffs had taken three main grounds in support of their contention for ejectment of the defendants from the suit premises. In the first place, the appellants alleged that they required the building in order to extend their business by running a hotel there themselves; secondly, as the lease had expired by efflux of time, the respondents were legally bound to surrender possession. Thirdly, it was averred by the plaintiffs that the Jammu & Kashmir Houses and Shops Rent Control Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) was wholly inapplicable to the premises in dispute, because the yearly income of the defendants far exceeded Rs. 20,000 and that running a hotel did not fall within the purview of section 2(3) of the Act. The suit was resisted by the respondents who took, inter alia, a number of objections to the grant of the relief to the appellants. In the first place, it was pleaded that tho income of the respondents being less than Rs. 20,000/ per year the suit was clearly covered by the Act. Secondly, it was averred that the definition of the word 'house ' in section 2(3) of the Act was wide enough to include a hotel. It was next averred that the plaintiffs had no personal necessity and had filed the suit merely for the purpose of getting a higher rent. Lastly, it was contended that as the plaintiffs required the house for running a hotel, such a purpose did not fall within the ambit of section ll(h) of the Act which applied only to such a case where the landlord required the house for his occupation and, at any 5 rate, having regard to the comparative advantages or disadvantages of the landlord and the tenant, there was no equity on the side of the plaintiffs. The case was tried by the City Judge, Srinagar who accepted the case of the defendants (respondents) and dismissed the plaintiffs ' suit. The plaintiffs thereupon filed an appeal before the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir which held that the plaintiffs had not proved their personal plaintiffs filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court and the same having been refused, they obtained special leave of this Court and hence the appeal before us. In support of the appeal Mr. Lal Narayan Sinha, counsel for the appellants submitted three points. In the first place, he contended that there was sufficient evidence to indicate that the income of the defendants respondents was more than Rs. 20,000/ a year, and, therefore, the provisions of the Act were not applicable and as the leave has expired due to efflux of time, the plaintiffs were entitled to a decree for ejectment straightway. Secondly, it was argued that the word 'house ' used in section 2(3) of the Act cannot include a hotel, and, therefore, the Act was not applicable. Lastly, it was submitted that the High Court committed a grave error of law in holding that the plaintiffs hold not been able to prove personal necessity although the High Court gave a clear finding that the plaintiffs had undoubtedly proved that they had a strong desire to occupy the building for running a hotel. It was argued that the finding of the High Court was not based on a discussion of the evidence and circumstances of the case and the High Court has taken an erroneous view of law on the nature of the need of the appellants as also on the question of the comparative advantages or disadvantages of the landlord and the tenant if a decree for eviction followed. After having heard counsel for the parties we are clearly of the opinion that the appeal must succeed on the third point raised by learned counsel for the appellants, i.e., the question of personal necessity and in this view of the matter we refrain from expressing any opinion on the applicability of the Act to the suit premises as averred by the respondents. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that there was sufficient material before the Court to show that the plaintiffs did not merely have a desire to occupy the building, but they actually needed the same and their need is both genuine and reasonable. In this connection, reliance was placed on the evidence of the witnesses for the plaintiffs which does not appear to have been considered by the High Court. We find that the plaintiffs had clearly mentioned in their plaint 6 that they required the house for the purpose of running the hotel business. On behalf of the plaintiffs P.W. Mohd. Yusuf had made it absolutely clear that they required the lease property for their personal need as they wanted to run the hotel themselves. The witness had further explained that this was necessary, because the plaintiffs could not maintain themselves from the income of the leased property. It is true that the plaintiffs were doing a small business, but the witness had made it clear that their income was very low so much so that they paid income tax of only Rs. 70 to Rs. 80/ per annum. These facts have not been demolished either in the cross examination of the witness or in the evidence of rebuttal given by the defendants. The above evidence of the plaintiffs is corroborated by other witnesses examined by them. P.W. Girdhari Lal has clearly stated that the plaintiffs want to extend their business and want to have the hotel in their own possession to run the same. He has further stated that the plaintiffs are running their business on a small scale, and he categorically stated that he had personally observed that there is very little work at the plaintiff 's shop now a days. That is why they want to run a hotel. The witness is a neighbour of the plaintiffs. shop and was, therefore, competent to depose to the facts mentioned above which have not been shaken in cross examination. P.W. Peer Ahmad Ullah has also stated that now a days people give up other occupations and take up hotel business because hotel business is itself a profitable business. The witness added that the plaintiff also want to extend their business and start a hotel in this building. P.W. Ghulam Nabi Dar also says that although the plaintiffs had a l? Boot shop they also want to run the hotel themselves, because their business has become dull. P W. Ghulam Mohd. whose shop is in front of the shop of the plain tiffs states as follows: \"The plaintiffs require the suit property for their own use, as they have been telling me for the last two or four years Previously, the business at Boot shops was running well but now it has become dull. The plaintiffs intend to run the hotel themselves. . . As for plaintiffs I say that they are in need of the hotel. The plaintiffs require the; hotel in order to extend their business\". Another neighbour of the plaintiffs P.W. Yash Paul states that the plaintiffs say that they will start a hotel in the suit property. He fur 7 ther deposes that there is little work in the shop of the plaintiffs, and, therefore, they want to start a hotel, P.W. Ghulam Mohd. who is the brother in law of P.W. Pir Ali. Mohd., father of the plaintiffs and was looking after his children on the death of P.W. Pir Ali Mohd. has also stated that the plaintiffs want to start business in the shape of a hotel in the house and they also want to run the shop. It is, therefore, proved by the evidence discussed above ( 1 ) that the plaintiffs required the house for their personal necessity in order to augment their income, (2) that as their income from the Boot shop is very small and they are not able to maintain themselves. so they want to run the hotel business in the suit premises. The High Court has not at all discussed this part of the evidence of the plaintiffs, but at the some time being impressed by the fact that the need of the plaintiffs was genuine the High Court gave a finding to at the plaintiffs had a strong desire to occupy the house and use it for commercial purposes. Thereafter the High Court appears to have lost itself in wilderness by entering into a hair splitting distinction between desire and need. Here the High Court has misdirected itself. If the plaintiffs had proved that their necessity was both genuine and reasonable, that the present premises which belonged to them were required for augmenting their income as the income so far received by them was not sufficient for them to make the two ends meet, there could be no question of a mere desire, but it is a case of real requirement or genuine need. In fact the irresistible inference which could be drawn from the facts is that the plaintiffs had a pressing necessity of occupying the premises for the purposes of conducting hotel business so as to supplement their income and maintain themselves property. The Act is a piece of social legislation and aimed at easing the problem of accommodation, protecting the tenants from evictions inspired by profit hunting motives and providing certain safeguards for the tenants and saving them from great expense, inconvenience and trouble. But the Act does not completely overlook the interest of the landlord and has under certain conditions granted a clear right to the landlord to seek eviction on proof of the grounds mentioned in section 11 of the Act. Thus, the Act appears to have struck a just balance between the genuine need of the landlord on the one hand and great inconvenience and trouble of the tenant on the other. It was also not disputed that the defendants had taken the property on lease only for a period of 10 years and now they have been in possession of the same for over 30 years. If the plaintiffs found that their present business had become dull and was not yielding sufficient income to maintain themselves and, therefore, it was necessary to occupy the house so as to run a hotel business, it cannot by any stretch of imagination be said that the plaintiffs had merely a desire rather than 8 a bonafide need for evicting the tenants. We therefore, disagree with the finding of he High Court that the plaintiffs had not proved that they had a bonafide need for occupation of the building in dispute. Moreover section 11(h) of the Act uses the words 'reasonable requirement ' which undoubtedly postulate that there must be an element of need as opposed to a mere desire or wish. The distinction between desire and need should doubtless be kept in mind but not so as to make even the genuine need as nothing but a desire as the High Court has done in this case. It seems to us that the connotation of the term 'need ' or 'requirement should not be artificially extended nor its language so unduly stretched or strained as to make it impossible or extremely difficult for one landlord to get a decree for eviction. Such a course would defeat the very purpose of the Act which affords the facility of eviction of the tenant to the landlord on certain specified grounds. This appears to us to be the general scheme of all the Rent Control Acts, prevalent in other State in the country. This Court has considered the import of the word requirement and pointed out that it merely connotes that there should be an element of need. In the case of Phiroze Ramanji Desai vs Chandrakant N. Patel & Ors. (1) Justice Bhagwati speaking for the Court observed as follows: The District Judge did not misdirect himself in regard to the true meaning of the word 'requires ' in section 13(1) (g) and interpreted it correctly to mean that there must be an element of need before a landlord can be said to 'require ' premises for his own use and occupation. It is not enough that the landlord should merely desire to use and occupy the premises. What is necessary is that he should need them for his own use and occupation. \" Thus, this Court has held that in such cases the main test should be whether it was necessary for the landlords to need the premises for their use or occupation. In the case of B. Balaiah vs Chandoor Lachaiah(2) a Division Bench of the High Court observed as follows: \"As long as such requirement is bona fide, the petitioner can certainly claim for a direction for eviction of the tenant\". It had become necessary for us to enter into the evidence led by the plaintiffs, because the High Court has in a general way made a sweeping obvervation that although the plaintiffs had a strong desire, they (1) [1974] I S.C.C. 661 (2) A.I.R 1965 A.P 435. 9 were not able to prove reasonable requirement and the High Court came to this finding without at all considering the evidence of competent and important witnesses examined by the plaintiffs on this point which has been discussed above. For these reasons, therefore, we are clearly of the opinion that in the instant case the plaintiffs had proved that the requirement for the house for starting a hotel business was both genuine and reasonable and even imperative, because the scanty income of the plaintiffs was not sufficient to maintain them or to afford them a decent or comfortable living. This brings us to the next limb of the argument of the learned counsel for the respondents regarding the interpretation of section 11 ( 1 ) (h) of the Act. Section ll(l)(h) of the Act runs thus: 11(1)(h) . . . . where the house or shop is reasonably required by the landlord either for purposes of building or re building, or for his own occupation or for the occupation of any person for whose benefit the house or shop is held; Explanation: The Court in determining the reasonableness of requirement for purposes of building or rebuilding shall have regard to the comparative public benefit or disadvantage by extending or diminishing accommodation, and in determining reasonableness of requirement for occupation shall have regard to the comparative advantage or disadvantage of the landlord or the person for whose benefit the house or shop is held and of the tenant\". It was submitted by Mr. Andley learned counsel for the respondents that the words used in section ll(l)(h) are \"that the house should be required by the landlord for his own occupation or for the occupation of and person for whose benefit the house or shop is held. \" It was argued that the words `own occupation ' clearly postulate that the landlord must require it for his personal residence and not for starting any business in the house. We are, however, unable to agree with this argument. The provision is meant for the benefit of the landlord and, therefore, it must be so construed as to advance the object of the Act. The word 'occupation ' does not exclude the possibility of the landlord starting a business or running a hotel in the shop which also would amount to personal occupation by the landlord. In our opinion, the section contemplates the actual possession of the landlord, whether for his own residence or for his business. It is manifest that even if the landlord is running a hotel in the house, he is undoubtedly in possession or occupation of the house in the legal sense of the term. 2 817SCI/78 10 Furthermore, the section is wide enough to include the necessity of not only the landlord but also of the persons who are living with him as members or the same family. In the instant case there can be no manner of doubt that the house was required for the personal residence or occupation of all the three plaintiffs who admittedly were the owners of the house. The fact that the plaintiffs wanted to occupy the property for running hotel would not take their case out of the ambit of personal necessity as already indicated above, occupation of a house may be required by the owner for personal purposes. He may choose to reside himself in the house or run a business in the house or use it as a paying guest house and derive income therefrom. In all these cases even though the owner may not physically reside in the house, the house in law would nevertheless be deemed to be in actual occupation of the owner. Having regard, therefore, to the circumstances mentioned above, we are unable to subscribe to the view that the words 'own occupation 'must be so narrowly interpreted so as to indicate actual physical possession of the landlord personally and nothing short of that. We, therefore, overrule the argument of the respondents on this point. The last argument that was advanced before us by Mr. Andley for the respondents was that taking an overall picture of the various aspects of the present case, it cannot be said that the balance of comparative advantages and disadvantages was in favour of the landlord. In this connection, our attention was drawn to the evidence led by the defendants that the main source of their income is the hotel business carried on by them in the premises and if they are thrown out they are not likely to get any alternative accommodation. The High Court has accepted the case of the defendants on this point, but does not appear to have considered the natural consequences which flow from a comparative assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of a landlord and the tenant if a decree for eviction follows. It is no doubt true that the tenant will have to be ousted from the house if a decree for eviction ii passed, but such an event would happen whenever a decree for eviction is passed and was fully in contemplation of the legislature when section ll(l)(h) of the Act was introduced in the Act. This by itself would not be a valid ground for refusing the plaintiffs a decree for eviction. Let us now probe into the extent of the hardship that may be caused to one party or the other, in case a decree for eviction is passed or is refused. It seems to us that in deciding this aspect of the matter each party has to prove its relative advantages or disadvantages and the entire 11 Onus cannot be thrown on the plaintiffs to prove that lesser disadvantages will be suffered by the defendants and that they were remediable. This matter was considered by this Court in an unreported decision in the case of M/s Central Tobacco Co. vs Chandra Prakash(l) where this Court observed as follows: \"We do not find ourselves able to accept the broad pro position that as soon as the landlord establishes his need for additional accommodation he is relieved of all further obligation under section 21 sub section (4) and that once the landlord 's need is accepted by the court all further evidence must be adduced by the tenant if he claims protection under the Act. Each party must adduce evidence to show what hardship would be caused to him by the granting or refusal of the decree and it will be for the court to determine wether the suffering of the tenant, in case a decree was made, would be more than that of the landlord by its refusal. The whole object of the Act is to provide for the control of rents and evictions, for the leasing of buildings etc. and section 21 specifically enumerates the grounds which alone will entitle a landlord to evict his tenant. The onus of proof of this is certainly on the landlord. We see no Sufficient reason for holding that once that onus is discharged by the landlord it shifts to the tenants making it obligatory on him to show that greater hardship would be caused to him by passing the decree than be refusing to pass it. In our opinion both sides must adduce all relevant evidence before the court; the landlord must show that other reasonable accommodation was not available to him and the tenant must also adduce evidence to that effect. It is only after shifting such evidence that the court must form its conclusion on consideration of all the circumstances of the case as to whether greater hardship would be caused by passing the decree than by refusing to pass it\". This case was followed in Phiroze Ramanji Desai vs Chandrakant N. Patel & Ors (supra). In the case of Kelley vs Goodwin(2) Lynskey, J. Observed as follows: \"The next matter one has to consider is whether there was evidence on which the county court judge could come to the conclusion that there would be greater hardship in mak (1) C.A. 1175 of 1969 decided on 23 4 1969. (2) 12 ing the order than not making the order. He has taken into account, in relation to that question, first, the position of the landlord, and, secondly, the position of the tenant. He has taken into account the financial means of the tenant. It is argued before us that he was wrong in doing that. In my view, he was quite entitled, in considering hardship, to have regard to the financial means of the tenant in considering whether he could obtain other accommodation because, by reason of his means, he was in a position, not merely to rent, but to buy a house. It seems to me also that, on this question cf hardship, the judge was entitled to take into account the fact that the tenant had taken no real steps to try and find other accommodation or no real steps to buy a house\". To the same effect is the decision in the case of K. Parasuramaiah vs Pokuri Lakshmamma(1) where a Division Bench of the High Court narrated the mode and circumstances in which the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the landlord and the tenant could be weighed. In this connection, the Court observed as follows: \"Thus the hardship of the tenant was first to be found out in case eviction is to be directed. That hardship then has to be placed against the relative advantages which the land lord would stand to gain if an order of eviction is passed . What is however required is a careful consideration of all the relevant factors in weighing the relative hardship which is likely to be caused to the tenant with the likely ad vantage of the landlord on the basis of the available material on record. '. The proviso however should not be read as if it confers a practical immunity on the tenant from being evicted. That would destroy the very purpose of Sec. 10(3)(c). Likewise the requirement of the land lord in accordance with that provision alone cannot be given absolute value, because that would mean to underestimate the value of the proviso to that section. Keeping in view therefore the purpose of the provision and the necessity of balancing the various factors each individual case has to be decided in the light of the facts and circumstances of that case ' '. In view of our findings it has been established that the landlords have not only a genuine requirement to possess the house, but it is necessary for them to do so in order to augment their income and maintain themselves properly. Being the owners of the house they (1) A.I.R. 1965 A.P.220 13 cannot be denied eviction and be compelled to live below the poverty line merely to enable the respondents to carry on their flourishing hotel business, at the cost of the appellants. This shows the great prejudice that will be caused to the plaintiffs if their suit is dismissed. The plaintiffs have already produced material before the court to show that their income does not exceed more than Rs. 8000 to Rs. 9000/ per year as the yearly income tax paid by them is Rs. 70 to Rs. 80 only. There is no other means for them to augment their income except to get their own house vacated by the defendants so as to run a hotel business. It was vehemently contended by Mr. Andley that there is nothing to show that the plaintiff Mohd. Yusuf or his mother had any experience of running a hotel, and, therefore, it is fruitless to allow them to run the hotel by evicting the respondents. Mohd. Yusuf is admittedly doing shoe business, and has got sufficient experience of business. Nothing has been brought on the record to show that he is incapable of running a hotel in the premises. The building belongs to him and there is Do reason for us to think that he cannot establish a hotel business. On the other hand the defendants have been running the hotel for the last 30 years and must have made sufficient profits. To begin with, the defendants had taken the lease only for 10 years which now by virtue of the statute has been extended to 30 years which is a sufficiently long period for which the plaintiffs have been deprived the possession of the house. There is thus no equity in favour of the respondents for continuing in possession any further. It was then submitted by Mr. Andley, counsel for the respondents that if the respondents are evicted they will be thrown out on the road; that hotel is the only source of their sustenance and they are not likely to get any alternative accommodation on being evicted. If the defendants had proved that they will not be able to get any accommodation any where in the city where they could set up a hotel, this might have been a weighty consideration, but the evidence of all the witnesses examined by the defendants only shows that the defendants may not be get alternative accommodation in that very locality where the house in dispute is situated. There is no satisfactory evidence to prove that even in other business localities there is no possibility of the defendants getting a house. To insist on getting an alternative accommodation of a similar nature in the same locality will be asking for the impossible. The defendants are tenants and had taken the lease only for 10 years but had overstayed for 20 years and they cannot be allowed to dictate to the landlord that they cannot be evicted unless they get a similar accommodation in the very same locality. 14 G. M. Khan the defendant himself has stated that if he is evicted from the house, he cannot get such a place any where. Great stress is laid that he must get a house of the size of the house in dispute. It was suggested to him that if one of the houses of the plaintiffs is given to him that will be sufficient for him, to which he said that the said house situated in Hari Singh High Street is not suitable because he can not run his hotel business there. The witness has further stated towards the end that the defendants cannot get any place for the purpose of running a hotel in this Ilaqa (locality). D.W. Ghani Hajam also says that the defendants cannot get any other building for the purpose of the hotel at this place like the one under dispute. Similarly, D. W. Ghulam Mohd. Khan, another witness for the defendants says that the defendants will not get such a building in this Ilaqa for running a hotel. D.W. Haji Noor Mohd. also endorses the fact that if the defendants are ejected, it is difficult for them to get such a building in this place. D.W. Mohd, Ramzan deposes that if the defendants are ejected from the building, they will not get such a building in this locality for running a hotel. To the same effect is the evidence of D. W. Rasool Dar who says that it is impossible for the defendants to get a house like the suit house for the purposes of running a hotel at the site or nearabout where the suit house is situated. D. W. Ghulam Mohd. has made a similar statement in his deposition when he says that the defendants will not get such a building nor is there any such building vacant in the locality. It is true that there are some witnesses like D. W. Aslam Khan, Ghulam Hassan, Mohd. Abdullah Pandey who has said that the defendants might not get any other place for running a hotel but the evidence is extremely vague and nebulous. D. W. Abdul Kabir however merely says that he had no knowledge that the defendants could get any other house. Thus, what is established from the evidence of the defendants is that if they are ejected, they might not get a house as big as the house in dispute in the very locality where the disputed house is situated. There is no clear evidence in the first place to show that there is no other business locality in the city at all or that if there is any other business locality attempts were made by the defendants but they Were unable to get any house. Furthermore, as indicated above, the plaintiff necessity is imperative and their requirement is undoubtedly reasonable, because the income which they are receiving including the rent of the house which is in the region of Rs. 5000/ per year, is not sufficient to maintain them. Thus, on a careful comparison and assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the landlord and the tenant it seems to us that the scale is tilted in favour of the plaintiffs. 15 The inconvenience, loss and trouble resulting from denial of a decree for eviction in favour of the plaintiffs far outweigh the prejudice or the inconvenience which will be caused to the defendants. The High Court has unfortunately not weighed the evidence from this point of view. Before closing the judgment we would like to observe that normally this Court does not interfere with concurrent findings of facts but as the High Court as also the Trial Court have made a legally wrong approach to this case and have committed a substantial and patent error of law in interpreting the scope and ambit of the words \"reasonable requirement\" and \"own possession\" appearing in section 11 (1) (h) of the Act and have thus misapplied the law and overlooked some of the essential features of the evidence as discussed by us, we had to enter into the merits of the case in order to prevent grave and substantial injustice being done to the appellants. For the reasons given above, the appeal is allowed. The judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside, and a decree for ejectment of the defendants from the house in dispute is hereby passed against the defendants. In the peculiar circumstances of this case, there will be no order as to costs. S.R. Appeal allowed.",

            "judgement": "Appeal No. 107 of 1960. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 21, 1959, of the Mysore High Court, Bangalore, in Misc. Appeal No. 68 of 1959. Purshottam Prikamdas, section N. Andley, J. B. DadaChanji, Rameshwar Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the appellant. 715 K. R. Karanth and Naunit Lal, for the respondent. April 27. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J. The respondent, Pothan Joseph, who was working as the Editor of the Deccan Herald owned and published by the appellant, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd., in Bangalore has filed a suit against the appellant on two contracts executed between the parties on April 1, 1948, and February 20, 1953, respectively, and has claimed accounts of the working of the Deccan Herald newspaper from April 1, 1948, to March 31, 1958, as well as payment of the amount that may be found due to him from the appellant under the provisions of cls. 2(d) and 1(d) of the said contracts. The services of the respondent were terminated by the appellant by its letter dated September 28, 1957, in which the respondent was told that the termination would take effect from March 31, 1958. However, by a subsequent letter written by the appellant to the respondent on March 17, 1958, the respondent was told that his services had been terminated with immediate effect and he was asked to hand over charge to his successor, Mr. T. section Ramachandra Rao. Thereafter on July 14, 1958, the respondent, filed the present suit against the appellant. The appellant contended that the two contracts on which the respondent's claim was based were subject to an arbitration agreement, and so it was not open to the respondent to file the present suit against the appellant. The appellant, therefore, requested the Court under section 34 of the Indian Arbitration Act, (hereinafter called the Act), to stay the proceedings initiated by the respondent and refer the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement between the parties. The learned trial judge who heard the appellant's application, however, exercised his discretion against it and refused to stay the proceedings in the respondent's suit. Thereupon the appellant preferred an appeal in the Mysore High Court but his appeal failed and the High Court confirmed the order passed by the trial court though for different reasons. The High 716 Court, however, thought that the learned trial judge, in dealing with the appellant's application had gone much further than he should have done, and hence it was desirable that the case should be tried by some other judge. The respondent did not object, and so the High Court directed that the suit may be transferred to the file of the Additional Civil Judge, Bangalore. The appellant then applied to the High Court for a certificate. His application was, however, rejected on the ground that the decision under appeal could not be considered as a judgment, decree or final order under article 133(1) of the Constitution; on that view it was thought unnecessary to decide whether on the merits the case was fit to be taken in appeal to this Court. Then the appellant applied for and obtained special leave from this Court. That is how this appeal has come before us; and the substantial point which arises for our decision is whether the courts below were in error in refusing to stay the suit filed by the respondent against the appellant in view of the arbitration agreement between them. Before we deal with the merits of the contentions raised by the parties in this appeal it is necessary to set out briefly the relevant facts leading to the present litigation. The appellant is a printing company and it owns and publishes the Deccan Herald in English and Prajavani in Kannada at Bangalore. By a contract dated April 1, 1948, the appellant engaged the respondent as Editor of the Deccan Herald for a period of five years on terms and conditions specified in the said contract. As provided by el. (5) of the said contract the period of the respondent's employment was extended by another five years by a subsequent contract entered into between the parties on February 20, 1953. As we have already mentioned the services of the respondent came to be terminated abruptly on March 17, 1958. It appears that by his letter dated October 16, 1957, the respondent made certain claims against the appellant under the provisions of the Working Journalists Act. Besides, he demanded 1/10th of the profits made by the Deccan Herald from 1948 up to the date of the termination of his service under the two respective contracts. This claim was denied by the appellant. Correspondence then ensued between the parties but since no common ground was discovered between them the respondent filed the present suit. His case is that the two contracts entitled him to claim 1/10th of the profits made by the Deccan Herald during the period of his employment, and so he claims an account of the said profits and his due share in them. The learned trial judge found that the respective contentions raised by the parties before him showed that there was no dispute as such between them which could attract the arbitration agreement. He also held that an attempt was made by the parties to settle their differences amicably through the mediation of Mr. Behram Doctor but the said attempt failed because the appellant was not serious about it and was just trying to protract, defeat and delay the plaintiff's moves. According to the learned trial judge a plea of limitation would fall to be considered in the present suit and it was desirable that the said plea should be tried by a competent court rather than by arbitrators. He was, however, not impressed by the respondent's contention that his character had been impeached by the appellant and so he should be allowed to vindicate his character in a trial before a court rather than before the arbitrators. In dismissing the appellant's claim for stay of the suit the learned judge observed that if the accounts of the Deccan Herald had not been separately maintained it would be competent for a qualified accountant to allocate expenses and capital expenses among the different activities of the appellant and then very little would be left for arbitrators to decide. He had no doubt that the contract by which the respondent was entitled to claim 1/10th share in the profits of the Deccan Herald necessarily postulated that the accounts of the Deccan Herald would be separately maintained. On these considerations the trial judge refused to stay the suit. When the matter went in appeal the High Court held that the dispute between the parties did not fall within the arbitration agreement. The High Court also considered the other points decided by the trial court; it held that Mr. Behram Doctor had not been appointed as an arbitrator between the parties and that the proceedings before him merely showed that the parties were exploring the possibility of having an arbitration. It observed that the appellant company was a big concern and referred to the respondent's apprehension that it was in a position to dodge the respondent's claim. However, the High Court was not impressed by these apprehensions, and it was not inclined to find fault with the conduct of the appellant in the trial court. It was also not satisfied that the question of limitation which would arise in the suit as well as the question of interpreting the contracts could not be properly tried by arbitration. It recognised that there had been a complete change of front on the part of the appellant in regard to the pleas raised by the appellant under the arbitration agreement when the matter was discussed before Mr. Behram Doctor, and when it reached the court in the form of the present suit. The High Court then considered other facts which it thought were relevant. It stated that there was great deal of bad blood between the parties and there was no meeting ground between them. The appellant's plea that recourse to arbitration may help an early disposal of the dispute did not appeal to the High Court as sound, and so, on the whole, the High Court thought that the order passed by the trial court refusing to stay the proceedings in suit should be confirmed. The appellant contends that the reasons given by the High Court in refusing to stay the suit are not convincing and that the discretion vesting in the High Court in that behalf has not been properly or judiciously exercised. Section 34 of the Act confers power on the court to stay legal proceedings where there is an arbitration agreement subject to the conditions specified in the section. The conditions thus specified are satisfied in the present case, but the section clearly contemplates that, even though there is an arbitration agreement and the requisite conditions specified by it are satisfied, the court may nevertheless refuse to grant stay if it is satisfied that there are sufficient reasons why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the arbitration agreement. In other words, the power to stay legal proceedings is discretionary, and so a party to an arbitration agreement against whom legal proceedings have been commenced cannot by relying on the arbitration agreement claim the stay of legal proceedings instituted in a court as a matter of right. It is, however, clear that the discretion vested in the court, must be properly and judicially exercised. Ordinarily where a dispute between the parties has by agreement between them to be referred to the decision of a domestic tribunal the court would direct the parties to go before the tribunal of their choice and stay the legal proceedings instituted before it by one of them. As in other matters of judicial discretion, so in the case of the discretion conferred on the court by section 34 it would be difficult, and it is indeed inexpedient, to lay down any inflexible rules which should govern the exercise of the said discretion. No test can indeed be laid down the automatic application of which will help the solution of the problem of the exercise of judicial discretion. As was observed by Bowen, L. J., in Gardner vs Jay (1) that discretion, like other judicial discretion, must be exercised according to common sense and according to justice. In exercising its discretion under section 34 the court should not refuse to stay the legal proceedings merely because one of the parties to the arbitration agreement is unwilling to go before an arbitrator and in effect wants to resile from the said agreement, nor can stay be refused merely on the ground that the relations between the parties to the dispute have been embittered or that the proceedings before the arbitrator may cause unnecessary delay as a result of the said relations. It may not always be reasonable or proper to refuse to stay legal proceedings merely because some questions of law would arise in resolving the dispute between the parties. On the other hand, if fraud or dishonesty is alleged against a party it may be open to the party whose character is impeached to claim that it should be given an opportunity to vindicate its character in an open trial before the court rather than before the domestic tribunal, and in a proper case the court may consider that fact as relevant for deciding whether stay should be granted or not. If there has been a long delay in making an application for stay and the said delay may reasonably be attributed to the fact that the parties may have abandoned the arbitration agreement the court may consider the delay as a relevant fact in deciding whether stay should be granted or not. Similarly, if complicated questions of law or constitutional issues arise in the decision of the dispute and the court is satisfied that it would be inexpedient to leave the decision of such complex issues to the arbitrator, it may, in a proper case, refuse to grant stay on that ground; indeed, in such cases the arbitrator can and may state a special case for the opinion of the court under section 13(b) of the Act. Thus, the question as to whether legal proceedings should be stayed under section 34 must always be decided by the court in a judicial manner having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each case. Where the discretion vested in the court under section 34 has been exercised by the trial court the appellate court should be slow to interfere with the exercise of the said discretion. In dealing with the matter raised before it at the appellate stage the appellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion. As is often said, it is ordinarily not open to the appellate court to substitute its own exercise of discretion for that of the trial judge; but if it appears to the appellate court that in exercising its discretion the trial court has acted unreasonably or capriciously or has ignored relevant facts and has adopted an unjudicial approach then it would certainly be open to the appellate court and in many cases it may be its duty to interfere with the trial court's exercise of discretion. In cases falling under this class the exercise of discretion by the trial court is in law wrongful and improper and that would certainly justify and call for interference from the appellate court. These principles are well established; but, as has been observed by Viscount Simon, L. C., in Charles Osenton & Co. vs Johnston (1) the law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by a judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well established, and any difficulty that arises is due only to the application of well settled principles in an individual case. In the present case there is one more fact which has to be borne in mind in dealing with the merits of the controversy before us. The appellant has come to this Court by special leave under article 136; in other words, the appellant is not entitled to challenge the correctness of the decision of the High Court as a matter of right. It is only in the discretion of this Court that it can be permitted to dispute the correctness or the propriety of the decision of the High Court, and so in deciding whether or not this Court should interfere with the order under appeal it would be relevant for us to take into account the fact that the remedy sought for by the appellant is by an appeal which is a discretionary matter so far as this Court is concerned. It is in the light of these principles that we must consider whether or not the appellant's complaint against the High Court's order can be upheld. The first point which calls for a decision relates to the construction of the contracts between the parties. As we have already stated two contracts were executed between them but their terms are substantially the same and so we may deal with the subsequent contract which was executed on February 20, 1953 (P. 2). Under this contract the respondent was engaged as the Editor of the Deccan Herald and his salary was fixed at Rs. 1,500 per mensem under paragraph 1 (a). Paragraph 1(b) and (c) deal with the other amenities to which the respondent was entitled. Clause (d) of paragraph 1 provides that when the newspaper shows a profit in the annual accounts the Editor shall be entitled to 1/10th share of it is on this clause that the respondent's claim in the present proceedings is based. The terms on which the respondent had to remain in the service of the appellant are specified in paragraph 2(a) and (b). Paragraph 3 provides for the renewal of the contract for a further period of five years if it is found that such renewal is for the mutual advantage of the parties. This paragraph also provides that during the continuance of his employment the respondent shall not directly or indirectly be interested in any other newspaper business than that of the appellant or any other journalistic activities in competition with that of the appellant. It also stipulates that if the contract is determined the respondent shall not for a period of three years thereafter be directly or indirectly interested in any newspaper business of the same kind as is carried on by the appellant within the Mysore State. It would thus be seen that this paragraph shows the liability imposed on the respondent as a consideration for the benefit conferred on him by paragraph 1 in general and cl. (d) of the said paragraph in particular. Paragraph 4 contains an arbitration agreement. It provides that if in the interpretation or application of the contract any difference of opinion arises between the parties the same shall be referred to arbitration. The arbitrator can be named by both the parties but if they failed to choose the same person each side will choose an arbitrator and the two will elect another person to complete the panel. Their award shall be final and binding on both the parties. The High Court has held that the present suit is outside the arbitration agreement because neither party disputes the applicability of the terms of the contract in the decision of the dispute. The High Court thought that in the context the words 'application of the contract' meant a dispute as to the applicability of the contract, and since the applicability of the contract was not in question and no dispute as to the interpretation of the contract arose, the High Court held that paragraph 4 was inapplicable to the present suit. Mr. Purshottam, for the appellant, contends that the construction placed by the High Court on the word 'application' is erroneous. According to him, any difference of opinion in regard to the application of the contract must in the context mean the working out of the contract or giving effect to its terms. In our opinion, this contention is well founded. The words 'interpretation or application of the contract' are frequently used in arbitration agreements and they generally cover disputes between the parties in regard to the construction of the relevant terms of the contract as well as their effect, and unless the context compels a contrary construction, a dispute in regard to the working of the contract would generally fall within the clause in question. It is not easy to appreciate what kind of dispute according to the High Court would have attracted paragraph 4 when it refers to a difference of opinion in the application of the contract. Since both the parties have signed the contract the question about its applicability in that form can hardly arise. Differences may, however, arise and in fact have arisen as to the manner in which the contract has to be worked out and given effect to, and it is precisely such differences that are covered by the arbitration agreement. We would accordingly hold that the High Court was in error in coming to the conclusion that the present dispute between the parties was outside the scope of paragraph 4 of the contract. If the High Court had refused to stay the present proceedings only on this ground the appellant would no doubt have succeeded; but the High Court has based its decision not only, nor even mainly, on the construction of the contract. The tenor of the judgment suggests that the High Court considered the other relevant facts to which its attention was invited and the material findings recorded by the trial judge, and though it differed from some of the findings of the trial judge, on the whole it felt no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that there was no reason to interfere with the trial court's exercise of discretion under section 34. That is why, even though the appellant has succeeded before us on the question of the construction of the arbitration agreement, having regard to the limits which we generally impose on the exercise of the jurisdiction under article 136, he must still satisfy us that we would be justified in interfering with the concurrent exercise of discretion by the two courts below, and that would inevitably depend upon the other relevant facts to which both the courts have referred, and on which both of them have relied though in different ways. What then are the broad features of the case on which the trial judge and the High Court have respectively relied? It is clear that the present dispute is not the result of an ordinary commercial transaction containing an arbitration clause. The contract in question is between a journalist and his employer by which the remuneration of the journalist has been fixed in a somewhat unusual manner by giving him a specified percentage in the profit which the Deccan Herald would make from year to year. According to the respondent he was surprised when the General Manager of the paper informed him that 75% of the overall expenditure incurred in the several activities of the appellant was being charged to the Deccan Herald, and that the capital liabilities were charged in the same proportion; he thought that this system of accounting adopted by the appellant was repugnant to the material provisions in his contract. Indeed his case is that after he came to know about this system he protested to the Director, Mr. Venkataswamy, who has been taking active part in the affairs of the appellant, and Mr. Venkataswamy assured him that as from the beginning of 1955 the accounts were being separately maintained. It would appear that the information received by the respondent from the General Manager disillusioned him and that appears to be the beginning of the present dispute, according to the respondent's letter of May 24, 1955, (D. 1). On February 18, 1956, the respondent invoked the arbitration agreement and told Mr. Venkataswamy that Mr. Behram Doctor had agreed to work as arbitrator and give his award (D. 2). Mr. Venkataswamy who was addressed by the respondent as the Managing Director told him by his reply of March 5, 1956, that he was not the Managing Director and added that in his view it was not open to the respondent to invoke cl. 4 of the contract because he was aware that no monies were payable to the respondent under cl. 1(d). It would thus be seen that Mr. Venkataswamy's immediate response to the respondent's request for arbitration was that the respondent could not invoke the arbitration clause (D. 3). It is true that on April 23, 1956, Mr. Venkataswamy attempted to explain this statement by saying that all that he intended to suggest was that no occasion for invoking the arbitration agreement had arisen. That, however, appears to be an unsatisfactory explanation (D. 10). Even so, Mr. Venkataswamy agreed to meet Mr. Behram Doctor and so on March 9, 1956, the respondent gave to Mr. Venkataswamy the address of Mr. Behram Doctor and asked him to see him (D. 5). He informed Mr. Behram Doctor accordingly (D. 6). It appears that subsequently Mr. Behram Doctor met both the respondent and Mr. Venkataswamy on May 9, 1956. The proceedings of this meeting which have been kept by Mr. Behram Doctor and copies of which have been supplied by him to both the parties indicate that Mr. Behram Doctor attempted to mediate between the parties and presumably the parties were agreeable to secure the mediation of Mr. Behram Doctor to resolve the dispute. We ought to add that the copy of the said proceedings produced by the appellant contains a statement that Mr. Venkataswamy at the outset told Mr. Behram Doctor that he had come on an unofficial visit and was speaking without the consent of the other directors. This statement is, however, not to be found in the copy supplied by Mr. Behram Doctor to the respondent. Prima facie it is not easy to understand why Mr. Behram Doctor should have omitted this material statement in the copy supplied by him to the respondent. That, however, is a matter which we do not propose to pursue in the present appeal. It is thus clear that though Mr. Behram Doctor was not appointed an arbitrator and no reference in writing was made to him an attempt was made by the parties to settle the dispute with the assistance of Mr. Behram Doctor, and that attempt failed. Having regard to the facts which have come on the record it may not be unreasonable to infer that the appellant was not too keen to pursue the matter on the lines originally adopted by both the parties before Mr. Behram Doctor. It also appears that for some years the accounts of the Deccan Herald had not been separately kept as they should have been according to the respondent's case. The respondent alleges that they have not been kept separately throughout the ten years; but that is a matter which is yet to be investigated. If the accounts are not separately kept the question of allocating expenditure would inevitably arise and that can be decided after adopting some ad hoc principle in that behalf. A plea of limitation has also been indicated by the appellant and it has been suggested that the first contract having merged in the second it is only under the latter contract that the respondent may have a cause of action. Thus the effect of the two contracts considered together may have to be adjudged in dealing with the question of limitation. It has also been suggested that the respondent knew how the accounts were kept from year to year and in substance he may be deemed to have agreed with the method adopted in keeping the accounts. If this point is raised by the appellant it may involve the decision of the question about the effect of the respondent's conduct on his present claim. The appellant has also suggested that the respondent has adopted an attitude of blackmailing the appellant and the respondent treats that as an aspersion on his character. The relations between the parties have been very much embittered and the respondent apprehends that the appellant, being a powerful company, may delay and seek to defeat the respondent's claim by protracting the proceedings before the arbitrators. It now looks impossible that the parties would agree to appoint one arbitrator, and so if the matter goes before the domestic tribunal the two arbitrators appointed by the two parties respectively may have to nominate a third one to complete the constitution of the domestic tribunal, and that it is said may easily lead to a deadlock. In the trial court attempts were made to settle this unfortunate dispute but they failed and the respondent's grievance is that the appellant adopted an unhelpful and noncooperative attitude. It appears fairly clear that when the parties entered into the present contract and agreed that differences between them in regard to the interpretation and application of the contract should be referred to arbitration they did not anticipate the complications which have subsequently arisen. That is why an arbitration agreement may have been introduced in the contract in question. All these facts have been considered by both the courts, and though it is true that in their approach and final decisions in respect of these facts the two courts have differed in material particulars, they have in the result agreed with the conclusion that the discretion vested in them should be exercised in not granting stay as claimed by the appellant. Under these circumstances we do not think we would be justified in substituting our discretion for that of the courts below. It may be that if we were trying the appellant's application under section 34 we might have come to a different conclusion; and also that we may have hesitated to confirm the order of the trial court if we had been dealing with the matter as a court of first appeal; but the matter has now come to us under article 136, and so we can justly interfere with the concurrent exercise of discretion by the courts below only if we feel that the said exercise of discretion is patently and manifestly unreasonable, capricious or perverse and that it may defeat the ends of justice. Having regard to all the circumstances and facts of this case we are not disposed to hold that a case for our interference has been made out by the appellant. That is why we dismiss this appeal but make no order as to costs throughout. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 190 of 1962. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 27, 1962 of the Punjab High Court in Criminal Revision No. 1172 of 1962. Nanak Chand, for the appellant. Gopal Singh, R.N. Sachthey and R.H. Dhebar, for the respondent. April 10, 1964. The Judgment of Subba Rao and Das Gupta JJ. was delivered by Subba Rao J. Raghubar Dayal, J. delivered a dissenting Opinion. 678 SUBBA RAO, J. This appeal by special leave raises the question of jurisdiction of an appellate court to exercise its power under s.6 of the (Act, No. 20 of 1958), hereinafter called the Act, in respect of an accused who was convicted by the trial court before the Act The facts are not now in dispute. The appellant, a resident of Palwal in Gurgaon District, committed house trespass and tried to outrage the modesty of a girl aged 7 years. He was sent up for trial before the Magistrate, First Class, Palwal. The said Magistrate, on May 31, 1962, convicted him under sections 451 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to six months' rigorous imprisonment under each count and directed that the sentences should run concurrently. He further imposed a fine of Rs. 200/ on the appellant under section 451 of the Indian Penal Code and ordered that, in default of payment of fine, he should undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months. The appellant was 16 years old at the time of his conviction. The Act was extended to Gurgaon District on September 1, 1962 and, therefore, at the time the appellant was convicted by the Magistrate, the Magistrate had no power or duty to make any order under the Act. The appellant preferred an appeal against his conviction and sentences to the Additional Sessions Judge, Gurgaon, who by his judgment dated September 22, 1962, dismissed the appeal. Though by the time the Additional Sessions Judge disposed of the appeal the said Act had come into force, neither the appellant relied upon the provisions of the Act nor did the learned Additional Sessions Judge exercised his power there under. The revision filed in the High Court by the Appellant was dismissed on September 27, 1962. The revision petition was dismissed in limine, but no ground was taken in the revision petition that the Additional Sessions Judge should have acted under s.6 of the Act. After the revision petition was disposed of, it appears that the appellant filed Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 793 of 1962 requesting the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act and to pass orders under sections 3, 4 or 6 thereof. The said application was also dismissed. Unfortunately the said application is not on the record and we are not in a position to know the exact scope of the relief asked for in the application and the reasons for which it was dismissed. The appellant filed a petition in the High Court under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution for a certificate of fitness to appeal to this Court. One of the grounds for seeking such a certificate was that the High Court should have acted under section 11 of the Act and passed orders under sections 3, 4 or 6 thereof. That petition having been dismissed, the appellant has preferred the present appeal to this Court by obtaining special leave. 679 Learned counsel for the appellant contends that, having regard to the admitted facts in the case, the High Court should have acted under section 11 of the Act and released the appellant on probation of good conduct instead of sending him to prison. On the other hand, learned counsel for the State argues that the Act is not retrospective in operation and, therefore, it will not apply to the appellant, as he was convicted before it came into force in Gurgaon District. Further he contends that neither section 11 of the Act nor s.6 thereof, on the basis of the express phraseology used therein, can be invoked in the circumstances of the present case. In any view, he says that the appellant, not having raised this plea till after the revision petition was disposed of by the High Court, is precluded by his default to raise this contention at this very late stage. The Act is a milestone in the progress of the modern liberal trend of reform in the field of penology. It is the result of the recognition of the doctrine that the object of criminal law is more to reform the individual offender than to punish him. Broadly stated, the Act distinguishes offenders below 21 years of age and those above that age, and offenders who are guilty of having committed an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life and those who are guilty of a lesser offence. While in the case of offenders who are above the age of 21 years absolute discretion is given to the court to release them after admonition or on probation of good conduct, subject to the conditions laid down in the appropriate provisions of the Act, in the case of offenders below the age of 21 years an injunction is issued to the court not to sentence them to imprisonment unless it is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offenders, it is not desirable to deal with them under ss. 3 and 4 of the Act. With this short background we shall now read the relevant provisions of the Act. Section 6.(1) When any person under twenty one years of age is found guilty of having committed an offence punishable with imprisonment (but not with imprisonment for life), the Court by which the person is found guilty shall not sentence him to imprisonment unless it is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of the case including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it would not be desirable to deal with him under section 3 or section 4, and if the Court passes any sentence of imprisonment on the offender, it shall record its reasons for doing so. 680 (2) For the purpose of satisfying itself whether it would not be desirable to deal under section 3 or section 4 with an offender referred to in sub section (1) the Court shall call for a report from the probation officer and consider the report, if any, and any other information available to it relating to the character and physical and mental condition of the offender. Section 11. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any other law, an order under this Act may be made by any Court empowered to try and sentence the offender to imprisonment and also by the High Court or any other Court when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, where an order under section 3 or section 4 is made by any Court trying the offender (other than a High Court), an appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of the former Court. (3) In any case where any person under twenty one years of age is found guilty of having committed an offence and the Court by which he is found guilty declines to deal with him under section 3 or section 4, and passed against him any sentence of imprisonment with or without fine from which no appeal lies or is preferred, then, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any other law, the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of the former Court may, either of its own motion or on an application made to it by the convicted person or the probation officer, call for and examine the record of the case and pass such order thereon as it thinks fit. (4) The first question is whether the High Court, acting under section 11 of the Act, can exercise the power conferred on a court under s.6 of the Act. It is said that the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 11(3) of the Act is confined only to a case that has been brought to its file by appeal or revision and, therefore, it can only exercise such jurisdiction as the trial court had, and in the present case the trial court could not have made any order under s.6 of the Act, as at the time it made the order the Act had not been extended to Gurgaon District. On this assumption, the argument proceeds, the Act should not be given retrospective operation, as, if so given, it would affect the criminal liability of a person for an act committed by him before the Act came into operation. In support of this contention a number of decisions bearing on the question of retroactivity of a 681 statute in the context of vested rights have been cited. Every law that takes away or impairs a vested right is retrospective. Every ex post facto law is necessarily retrospective. Under article 20 of the Constitution, no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. But an ex post facto law which only mollifies the rigour of a criminal law does not fall within the said prohibition. If a particular law makes a provision to that effect, though retrospective in operation, it will be valid. The question whether such a law is retrospective and if so, to what extent depends upon the interpretation of a particular statute, having regard to the well settled rules of construction. 'Maxwell On Interpretation of Statutes', 11th edition, at pp. 274-275, summarizes the relevant rule of construction thus: 'The tendency of modern decision, upon the whole, is to narrow materially the difference between what is called a strict and a beneficial construction. All statutes are now construed with a more attentive regard to the language, and criminal statutes with a more rational regard to the aim and intention of the legislature, than formerly. It is unquestionably right that the distinction should not be altogether erased from the judicial mind, for it is required by the spirit of our free institutions that the interpretation of all statutes should be favourable to personal liberty, and this tendency is still evinced in a certain reluctance to supply the defects of language, or to eke out the meaning of an obscure passage by strained or doubtful influences. The effect of the rule of strict construction might almost be summed up in the remark that, were an equivocal word or ambiguous sentence leaves a reasonable doubt of its meaning which the canons of interpretation fail to solve, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the subject and against the legislature which has failed to explain itself. But it yields to the paramount rule that every statute is to be expounded according to its expressed or manifest intention and that all cases within the mischiefs aimed at are, if the language permits, to be held to fall within its remedial influence.' Let us now proceed to consider the question raised in the present case. This is not a case where an act, which was not an offence before the Act, is made an offence under the Act; nor 682 is this a case where under the Act a punishment higher than that obtaining for an offence before the Act is imposed. This is an instance where neither the ingredients of the offence nor the limits of the sentence are disturbed, but a provision is made to help the reformation of an accused through the agency of the court. Even so the statute affects an offence committed before it was extended to the area in question. It is, therefore, a post facto law and has retrospective operation. In considering the scope of such a provision we must adopt the rule of beneficial construction as enunciated by the modern trend of judicial opinion without doing violence to the provisions of the relevant section. Section 11(3) of the Act, on the basis of which the learned counsel for the State advances most of his arguments, has no relevance to the present appeal: the said subsection applies only to a case where no appeal lies or is preferred against the order of a court declining to deal with an accused under s.3 or s.4 of the Act, and in the instant case an appeal lay to the Sessions Judge and indeed an appeal was preferred from the order of the Magistrate. The provision that directly applies to the present case is section 11(1) of the Act, where under an order under the Act may be made any Court empowered to try and sentence the offender to imprisonment and also by the High Court or any other court when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision. The sub section ex facie does not circumscribe the jurisdiction of an appellate court to make an order under the Act only in a case where the trial court could have made that order. The phraseology used therein is wide enough to enable the appellate court or the High Court, when the case comes before it, to make such an order. It was purposely made comprehensive, as the Act was made to implement a social reform. As the Act does not change the quantum of the sentence, but only introduces a provision to reform the offender, there is no reason why the Legislature should have prohibited the exercise of such a power, even if the case was pending against the accused at one stage or other in the hierarchy of tribunals. If the provisions of section 6(1) of the Act were read along with section 11, we would reach the same result. When section 11(1) says that an appellate court or a revisional court can make an order under the Act, it means that it can make an order also under s.6(1) of the Act. If so, 'court' in s.6(1) will include an appellate court as well as a revisional court. If an appellate court or a revisional court finds a person guilty, under that section it shall not sentence him to imprisonment unless the conditions laid down in that section are satisfied. Can it be said that the expression 'the court by which the person is found guilty' does not include the appellate or revisional court? When an appellate court or a revisional court confirms a conviction made by a trial court or sets aside an acquittal made by it and convicts the accused, in either case it 683 finds the accused guilty, for without finding the accused guilty it cannot either confirm the conviction or set aside the order of acquittal and convict him. If the contention advanced by learned counsel for the State, namely, that the Act will apply only to convictions made by the trial court after the Act came into force, be accepted, it would lead to several anomalies; it would mean that the Act would apply to a conviction made by a trial court after the Act came into force, but would not apply to an accused, though his appeal was pending after the Act came into force; it would apply to the accused if the appellate court set aside the conviction and sent back the case to the trial court for fresh disposal, but would not, if the appellate court itself convicted him. On the other hand if the expression 'found guilty' was given the natural meaning, it would take in the finding of guilty made by any court in a pending criminal proceeding in the hierarchy of tribunals after the Act came into force. This view gets support from the judgment of this Court in Ramji Missar vs State of Bihar(1). The facts of that case relevant to the present case were as follows: The Assistant Sessions Judge, Arrah, convicted one Basist under section 307 and section 326 of the Indian Penal Code. As the offences under the said sections were punishable with imprisonment for life, the provisions of the Act were not applicable to Basist and, therefore, the Assistant Sessions Judge sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 6 years under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and for 4 years rigorous imprisonment under section 326 of the said Code and ordered the sentences to run concurrently. But the High Court on appeal found Basist guilty of an offence under s.324 of the Indian Penal Code. It was contended that the High Court could not make an order under s.6(1) of the Act, on the ground that section 11 of the Act did not confer such a power on the High Court. Dealing with this argument, this Court observed: 'It is however possible that the words in section 11(1) 'pass an order under the Act' are not to be construed so strictly and literally, but to be understood to mean 'to exercise the powers or jurisdiction conferred by the Act.' This wide interpretation might perhaps be justified by the scope and object of this section. Section 11 is to apply 'notwithstanding anything in the Code or any other law' to all courts empowered to sentence offenders to imprisonment. To read a beneficial provision of this universal type in a restricted sense, so as to confine the power of these courts to the exercise of the [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 745, 755. 684 powers under sections 3 and 4 alone would not, in our opinion, be in accord with sound principles of statutory interpretation. We are therefore inclined to hold that the Courts mentioned in section 11 be they trial courts or exercising appellate or revisional jurisdiction are thereby empowered to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on Courts not only under sections 3 and 4 and the consequential provisions but also under s.6.' When it was contended that the word 'may' in section 11 of the Act empowers the appellate court or the High Court to exercise the power at its option and the words 'any order under the Act' empower it to make an order without reference to the standards laid down in the Act, this Court rejected both the contentions. It held that the expression 'may' has compulsory force and that the power conferred on the appellate court was of the same nature and characteristic and subject to the same criteria and limitations as those conferred on courts under sections 3 and 4 of the Act. This decision lays down three propositions, namely, (i) an appellate court or a revisional court can make an order under s.6(1) of the Act in exercise of its power under s.11(1) thereof; (ii) it can make such an order for the first time even though the trial court could not have made such an order, having regard to the finding given by it; and (iii) in making such an order it is subject to the conditions laid down in sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Act. The only distinguishing feature between the present case and the said decision is that in the present case the trial court did not make the order as the Act was not extended to the area within its jurisdiction and in the said decision the trial court did not make the order as it could not, on its finding that the accused was guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life. But what is important is that this Court held that the High Court for the first time could make such an order under section 11 of the Act, as such a power was expressly conferred on it by section 11 of the Act. We, therefore, hold that the appellate court in appeal or the High Court in revision can, in exercise of the power conferred under section 11 of the Act, make an order under section 6(1) thereof, as the appellate court and the High Court, agreeing with the Magistrate, found the accused guilty of the offences for which he was charged. The next question is whether this Court can exercise the same power under section 11(1) of the Act. This Court in disposing of an appeal against an order of the High Court would be deciding what the High Court should have held in the revision before it. This Court’s power would also be confined to the scope of the power exercisable by the High Court. This Court, therefore, can either make an order under s.6(1) of the Act or 685 direct the High Court to do so. But whether this Court directly makes an order under s.6(1) or directs the High Court to do so, it is bound to comply with the provisions of s.6 of the Act. A court cannot impose a sentence of imprisonment on a person under 21 years of age found guilty of having committed an offence punishable with imprisonment (but not with imprisonment for life) unless it is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of the case including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it would not be desirable to deal with him under s.3 or s.4 of the Act. For the purpose of satisfying itself in regard to the said action, under sub section (2) of section 6 of the Act the Court shall call for a report from the probation officer and consider the report, if any, and any other information available to it relating to the character and physical and mental condition of the offender. After considering the said material the court shall satisfy itself whether it is desirable to deal with the offender under section 3 or section 4 of the Act. If it is not satisfied that the offender should be dealt with under either of the said two sections, it can pass the sentence of imprisonment on the offender after recording the reasons for doing so. It is suggested that the expression 'if any' in sub section (2) of s.6 indicates that it is open to the court to call for a report or not; but the word 'shall' makes it a mandatory condition and the expression 'if any' can in the context only cover a case where notwithstanding such requisition the Probation Officer for one reason or other, has not submitted a report. Briefly stated the calling for a report from the Probation Officer is a condition precedent for the exercise of the power under s.6(1) of the Act by the Court. We think that in the circumstances of the case the best course is to remand the matter to the High Court to make an order after complying with section 6(1) of the Act. Lastly it is contended that we should not at this very late stage of the proceeding, and especially in view of the observations of the Additional Sessions Judge in sentencing the accused, interfere with the order of the High Court. Ordinarily this Court would be reluctant to allow a party to raise a point for the first time before it. But in this case both the Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court ignored the mandatory provisions of the Act. It is true that the accused did not bring the provisions of the Act to the notice of the court till after the revision was disposed of. But that does not absolve the court from discharging its duty under the Act. The observations made by the Additional Sessions Judge in sentencing the accused were made de hors the provisions of the Act. These observations it cannot be held that the learned Additional Sessions Judge had satisfied himself of the conditions laid down in s.6(1) of the Act. That apart, as we have pointed out, he could not have legally satisfied himself of the matters mentioned in s.6(1) of the Act without complying with the conditions laid down therein. We are satisfied that, as the Act was recently extended to Gurgaon District, its existence had escaped the attention of the Additional Sessions Judge as well as of the High Court and, therefore, it is a fit case for our interference under article 136 of the Constitution. We set aside the order of the High Court and direct it to make an order under s.6 of the Act, or, if it so desires, to remand it to the Sessions Court for doing so. We should also make it clear that we do not intend to question the correctness of the finding of the courts in regard to the guilt of the accused; indeed, the learned counsel for the appellant did not question the said finding. That when a person has been found guilty for the first time of an offence to which the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the (Act No. 20 of 1958), hereinafter called the Act, could apply, and such finding, be it of the trial Court or of the appellate Court, is arrived at before the application of the Act, the Court of appeal or revision cannot take action under section 11(1) of the Act when the case comes before it in appeal or revision. In this case, the trial Court had convicted the appellant prior to the application of the Act in that area and could not take into consideration the provisions of that Act in the passing of the sentences on convicting the appellant. The appellant was convicted by the trial Court on May 31, 1962, prior to the application of the Act to that area. The Act was applied on September 1, 1962, by a Government Notification, when the appellant’s appeal was pending in the Court of the Sessions Judge. The appeal was dismissed on September 22, 1962. The appellant did not draw the attention of the Court to the provisions of the Act. The Court did not consider them. The appellant went in revision to the High Court. The revision was dismissed on September 27, 1962. The High Court also did not refer to the provisions of the Act. On September 28, 1962 the appellant filed a petition praying that under sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Act the petitioner be released or that he be dealt with under section 562(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, hereinafter, called the Code. That application was rejected. Neither this petition nor the order of rejection was mentioned in the petition for special leave to appeal. Reference to these is found in the petition filed in the High Court for leave to appeal to this Court under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution dated October 3, 1962, printed at 687 p. 25 of the appeal record and in the grounds of appeal accompanying it. The petition for special leave filed in this Court sought leave to appeal against the order and judgement dated September 27, 1962 in the main revision case and not against the order rejecting the petition, Criminal Miscellaneous, No. 793 of 1962. It was not a correct statement in paragraph 9 of the special leave petition, to the effect that the petitioner filed an application under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution for grant of certificate of fitness for leave to appeal to this Court, but it was refused on October 19, 1962. The ground, as recorded, prima facie showed that such an application was for leave to appeal against the order in the Criminal Revision, No. 1172 of 1962. In these circumstances, the special leave granted is liable to be revoked. The appellate court sees that the order of the court below, on the material on record is correct or not and has to pass a correct order on that material. If the trial Court could not have taken action under the provisions of the Act which was not in force at the time it found the accused guilty, the appellate Court could not have taken action under those provisions unless the Act specifically provided for those provisions to be applicable to cases which had been decided earlier, prior to its application. There is no such express provision in the Act and I do not find any necessary implication from the provisions of the Act in that regard. It is true that appellate Courts have allowed parties to take advantage of a law enacted during the pendency of the case, but this is done when parties can litigate further in view of the changed law and is done to save multiplicity of proceedings. Such a ground is not available in the present case. Ordinarily, it takes a few years for a case decided by a Magistrate who tries it in the first instance, and the passing of the final order by the High Court in revision. Ordinarily, an appeal lies to the Sessions Judge from the order of the Magistrate and a revision against the Sessions Judge’s order to the High Court. The two proceedings before the Sessions Judge and the High Court do take time. The Act is an all India Act and there would be a very large number of persons convicted by trial Courts prior to the enforcement of the Act. It is too much to suppose that the legislature intended that all the orders of the Magistrates in such cases of conviction against persons under 21 years of age automatically become illegal and liable to correction by the Courts of appeal and revision. Not only would they be liable to be set aside, the setting aside of the Magistrates’ orders about sentences would not have ended the matters but would have led to further proceedings to be taken by the Magistrates or the appellate Courts for the purpose of coming to a conclusion whether action can be taken in accordance with the provisions of sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Act. All those numerous cases would have to be reopened and I cannot believe that the legislature would have intended such a result and would not have expressed itself very clearly if it had really intended so. Section 3 of the Act empowers the Court to release certain offenders after admonition and section 4 empowers the Court to release certain offenders on probation of good conduct. The Court which is to take action under these sections is the Court by which the person is found guilty of the offences in the respective sections and in circumstances specified in the respective sections. Such orders are made instead of sentencing the person found guilty to any punishment which could be awarded to him. It is clear that action under these sections can be taken by the Court which finds a person guilty of the offence for the first time. A person may be found guilty of the respective offence by the trial Court or by appellate Court if it alters his conviction for an offence which did not fall under either of those sections to one which falls under any of them, or by the High Court if it finds the accused person guilty on appeal against acquittal. It is in these circumstances that it can be said that the trial Court or the appellate Court or the High Court has found an accused guilty. A Court of revision cannot convert a finding of acquittal into a finding of conviction and therefore no such case can arise in which a Court of revision for the first time finds an accused guilty of an offence to which the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Act apply. When an appellate Court confirms the conviction of a person it is not the Court which finds him guilty but is the Court which confirms the finding of the trial Court about the person being guilty on forming an opinion that the order of the trial Court is correct. If the expression ‘the Court by which the person is found guilty’ was to include the appellate Court confirming the conviction of a person for the offence which fell under any of the two sections, it would not have been necessary to clothe the appellate Court with a power to take action under these sections, as sub section (1) of section 11 does. This subsection reads: 'Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any other law, an order under this Act may be made by any Court empowered to try and sentence the offender to imprisonment and also by the High Court or any other Court when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision.' It is clear from the language of this sub section that the Court which is empowered to order under the Act in the first instance is the Court which is empowered to try and sentence the offender to imprisonment, i.e., the original trial 689 Court. It is given the power to take action under the Act. Orders under the Act can also be made by the High Court or any other Court when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision. The question is as to in which case the High Court or any other Court, can exercise its power. It can exercise it, when the case in which the trial Court could have exercised the power comes before it. This is to be deduced from the use of the word ‘also’ and from the occasion when the High Court or any other Court can make such an order, it being when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision. It must, therefore, be the case in which the trial Court could take a certain action in which the High Court or any other Court could also take action only when it came before it on appeal or in revision. I do not consider it reasonable to construe the language of sub section (1) to mean that the High Court or any other Court could take action in all cases of appeal or revision before it irrespective of the fact whether the trial Court could have made an order under the Act in those cases or not. The scheme of section 11 seems to support this view sub section (1) mentions the Courts which can make orders under the Act. Sub section (2) provides an appeal where an order under section 3 or section 4 is made by any Court in trying an offender. This means that when a Court trying an offender convicts him and takes action under section 3 or section 4, an appeal in that case will lie. Of course no question of the appellate Court taking action under section 3 or section 4 arises in such appeals because action has already been taken by the trial Court and the appellate Court would only look to the correctness of the conviction and in case it finds action under section 3 or section 4 to be unjustified, may even set aside that order and pass suitable sentence as provided in sub section Sub section (2) makes provision for an appeal and sub section (4) makes provision for the appellate Court to consider the propriety of any order made under sections 3 or 4 of the Act. These provisions in sub section (2) and sub section (4) exhaust the cases in which orders under sections 3 or 4 could be made by the High Court or any other Court. While sections 3 and 4 confer a discretionary power in the Court to make an order under those sections in certain circumstances, sub section (1) of section 6 makes it incumbent on the Court finding a person under 21 years of age guilty of offences punishable with imprisonment not to sentence such person convicted of such an offence to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having regard to the facts mentioned in the sub section that it would not be desirable to deal with him under section 3 or section 4 and in that case it has to record its reasons for sentencing him to imprisonment. Sub section (2) makes it incumbent on the Court to get a report from the Probation Officer and consider it in order to satisfy itself whether it would not be desirable to deal under section 3 or section 4. These provisions of section 6 restrict 690 the discretion of the trial Court for taking action under section 3 and section 4 in regard to persons under 21 years of age and convicted of all offences except offences punishable with imprisonment for life. A Court can, however, sentence such a person to imprisonment only after considering various matters and finally satisfying itself that it would not be desirable to make an order under section 3 or section 4 in regard to that person. A case to which the provisions of section 6 apply is dealt with by sub section (3) of section 11 which provides that when a Court has declined to deal with the person under section 3 or section 4 and has passed a sentence of imprisonment and when no appeal lies or none has been preferred from that order, the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentence of the Court may, suo motu or on an application made to it by the convicted person or the Probation Officer, call for and examine the record of the case and pass such order thereon as it thinks fit. Of course, if the order is appealable, the appellate Court can consider the matter in view of the power conferred under sub section (1), which enables the appellate Court when the case comes before it to make any order under the Act. Action under sub section (3), it is clear, can be taken by the appellate Court only in cases in which the trial Court has declined to take action under section 3 or section 4, that is to say, the trial Court, at the time of conviction and sentencing a person, had the power to make an order under section 3 or section 4 and had felt satisfied that such an order was not desirable. If it has no such power at the time and has passed a non appealable order, or when the convicted person does not appeal, action cannot be taken under sub section (3) because it cannot be said with any propriety that the trial Court had declined to take action under section 3 or section 4. This is a strong indication of the fact that powers conferred on the High Court or any Court of appeal or revision under section 11 are to be exercised in the cases coming before them in which the trial Court itself could have made an order under the Act. Reference may also be made to an incidental matter. An order of admonition under section 3 puts an end of the case it being the final order against the convicted person, subject of course to the orders of the appellate Court in case the convicted person appeals against his conviction. This cannot be said with respect to an order under section 4, an order which would direct that the convicted person be released on his entering into a bond to appear and receive sentence when called upon during such period, not exceeding 3 years, as the Court may direct and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. The passing of the sentence provided for the offence is put off and the convicted person stands the risk of a proper sentence being passed against him in future in 691 certain circumstances. Section 9 provides in case of the convict’s failure to observe the conditions of the bond that he and his sureties be summoned to Court which may remand the accused to custody or grant him bail and, if satisfied that he had failed to observe any of the conditions of the bond, forthwith to sentence him for the original offence and where the failure is for the first time to impose upon him a penalty not exceeding Rs. 50/ without prejudice to the continuance in force of the bond. In case a convicted person has not been able to observe the conditions of the bond, he, in a way, stands to suffer larger punishment than what he would have got in the first instance in case in addition to the sentence which would be passed upon him he had already, for a certain period, observed the conditions of the bond and had also, in view of the provisions of section 5, paid compensation to the victim of the offence and costs of the proceedings which are recovered as fine. The Code does not provide for the payment of costs and provides for the payment of compensation when ordered out of the fine imposed on an accused; vide sections 545 and 546A of the Code. This Court considered certain provisions of the Act in Ramji Missar vs State of Bihar(1) and held that the crucial date for the application of the aforesaid sections viz., sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Act to the case of an accused whose conviction by the trial Court of offences to which those sections do not apply, was altered by the appellate Court to an offence to which the provisions of those sections applied, would be the date of the decision of the trial Court in view of the terms of the section on grounds of logic as well as on the theory that the order passed by an appellate Court was the correct order which the trial Court should have passed. This tends to support the view I have expressed above. It may be mentioned that in that case the trial Court could make an order under section 4 of the Act at the time it convicted one Basist, who was then under 21 years of age, if it had convicted him of the offence to which the provisions of section 4 applied. The High Court altered the conviction to such an offence but held that it was not competent to pass an order under section 6 of the Act. This Court held that it could. In the instant case, the trial Court could not take any action in accordance with the provisions of the Act for the simple reason that the Act was not in force on the day it convicted the appellant. I am, therefore of opinion that the point for determination before us, that is, whether the appellate Court can make an order under the Act in cases in which the trial Court on the date of conviction could not have made an order under the Act did not arise for decision in that case. This question, (1) [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 745, is very different from the question whether an appellate Court can make an order under the Act when it alters the conviction of an appellant to an offence with respect to which an order under the Act could have been made by the trial Edison, as arose in Ramji’s Case(1). I am therefore of opinion that the High Court could not have made an order under the Act in this case and that therefore this appeal should fail. I would accordingly dismiss it. ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority, we set aside the order of the High Court and direct it to make an order under section 6 of the Act, or, if it so desires, to remand it to the Sessions Court for doing so. Appeal allowed. (1) [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 745.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No 797 of 1976. From the Judgment and Order dated 14.7.1972 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal No. 59 of 1971 V.C. Mahajan, Mrs. Subhadra and C.V. Subba Rao for the Appellants. Harish N. Salve, Ravinder Narain, P.K. Ram, D.N. Mishra and K. Sukumaran for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by THAKKAR, J. Whether Section 12(2)1 of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of 1947 (Act) designed to prevent wholesale or partial evasion of repatriation of earnings from export of goods covers only sale proceeds of goods exported 'for sale' as held by the High Court of Calcutta by the judgment under appeal, or to sale proceeds of goods exported 'on sale' in the context of sales completed before export also, as held by the Madras High Court2 and as contended by the appellants is the problem. '12(2) Where any export of goods has been made to which a notification under sub section (1) applies, no person entitled to sell, or procure the sale of the said goods shall, except with the permission of the Reserve Bank, do or refrain from doing anything or take or refrain from taking any action which has the effect of securing that (a) the sale of the goods is delayed to an extent which is unreasonable having regard to the ordinary course of trade, or (b) payment for the goods is made otherwise than in the prescribed manner or does not represent the full amount payable by the foreign buyer in respect of the goods, subject to such deductions if any, as may be allowed by the Reserve Bank, or is delayed to such extent as aforesaid. Provided that no proceedings in respect of any contravention of this sub section shall be instituted unless the prescribed period has expired and payment for the goods representing the full amount as aforesaid has not been made in the prescribed manner.' 2. R. Venkatasubbu and Ors. vs The Director of Enforcement. Enforcement Directorate, New Delhi and Anr., ILR Vol. 3MAD 1968 p.18. 985 The learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court dismissed a Writ Petition instituted by the Respondent Company and refused to quash two show cause notices dated November 5, 1966 issued under Section 12 (2) of the Act as it stood at the material time on taking the view canvassed by the appellants in this appeal. A Division Bench of the High Court however allowed the appeal preferred by the Respondent Company, reversed the order of the learned Single Judge dismissing the Writ Petition, and issued a Writ of Mandamus commanding the competent authorities under the Act (appellants herein) to forbear from giving effect to the said notices and from commencing any proceedings pursuant thereto. The competent authorities under the Act have approached this Court by way of the present appeal by a certificate under Article 133 (1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The hub of the argument addressed by the respondent company, which found favour with the Calcutta High Court, but failed to impress the Madras High Court, is the expression 'no person entitled to sell or procure the sale of the said good' employed by the legislature in the opening part of Section 12(2) of the Act, which to the material extent deserves to be quoted: '12(2) Where any export of goods has been made to which a notification under sub section (1) applies, no person entitled to sell, or procure the sale of the said goods shall, except with the permission of the Reserve Bank, do or refrain from doing anything or take or refrain from taking any action which has the effect of securing that . ' The argument runs thus: Section 12 (2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act 1942, on its plain terms, applies only to 'persons' who are 'entitled to sell or procure the sale of the said goods.' The word 'entitled' governs the word 'sell' as well as the expression 'procure the sale of'. Further, both these expressions are used with respect to the 'said goods' which means the goods which have already been exported. It is in these premises submitted that Section 12(2) applies only to such persons who are entitled to sell or procure the sale of goods which have already been exported. We are not impressed by this submission that the aforesaid expression can be so narrowly construed so as to govern the scope of Section 12 (2) in such a truncated manner which renders it virtually 986 impotent in so far as transactions of 'exports on sale' are concerned. Too much is being read into too little for no more laudable a purpose than to paralyze the provision. It appears to us that this expression does not necessarily induce one to the conclusion that the legislature wanted to prevent abuse in the context of exports for sale ' only. The expression is meaningful, relevant, and can co exist in the context of abuse arising from 'exports on sale ' from completed transactions as well. The expression 'no person entitled to sell, or procure the sale of the said goods' is merely descriptive of the person who is accountable under the said provisions as has been held by the Madras High Court in R. Venkata Subbu 's case, I.L.R. Vol. 3 Madras , which has made a correct meaningful, and purposeful approach with which we unhesitatingly agree. The whole purpose is to 'identify ' the accountable persons to prevent malpractises and ensure compliance. It is conceivable that the exports might be made in the name of or through the agency of a person other than the 'owner of goods ' or the person entitled to sell the goods arising out of an 'export on sale. In our view, Anantaraman, C J, who spoke for the Madras High Court in Venkatasubbu 's case (supra) was right in taking the view that the words 'no person entitled to sell or procure the sale of the goods' are descriptive words which refer to the person in the capacity of the seller of the goods or the person entitled to procure the sale of the goods after the export of the goods has been made and that this expression does not necessarily imply that the export must be to a nominee of the consignor at the other end in pursuance to a contemplated transaction of sale. We are therefore unable to accede to the submission urged on behalf of the Respondent Company (original Writ Petitioner) that Section 12 (2) can apply only to such persons who are entitled to sell or procure the sale of goods which have already been exported for sale and not to the exports made in pursuance to sales which have already been effected to a foreign buyer before the exports. In our opinion, the said expression has been employed by the Legislature merely in order to identify the accountable persons and is merely descriptive in that sense. The said expression does not restrict the operation of the Act to the persons who have not yet sold the goods. One would have to take a quantum jump in order to conclude that persons referred to in Section 12 (2) are the persons who have not yet sold the goods but are entitled to sell the goods in future merely because the expression 'entitled to sell ' has been employed. The persons who have exported the goods to a foreign buyer, in our view, are not sought to be excluded from the operation of section 12 (2). This conclusion is reinforced if clauses (a) and (b) of Section 12(2) are taken into account. Clause (a) in terms adverts to the sale of goods being delayed. Clause (b) of Section 12(2) adverts to payment for the goods, otherwise than in the prescribed manner, and also envisions a case where the payment does not represent the full amount payable by the foreign buyer in respect of the goods. Clauses (a) and (b) are compatible both with transactions of export on sale as also to transactions of export for sale. They are compatible with all transactions pertaining to both types of sales. There is no warrant to assume that the Legislature has not made any provision in order to ensure that the full amount of the sale price is repatriated and foreign exchange earned therefrom is not lost to the Nation regardless of whether it is in respect of export on sale ' or 'export for sale '. The avowed and the evident object of Section 12 is to ensure that that the Nation does not lose foreign exchange which is very much essential for the economic survival of the Nation. The exporter cannot be allowed to syphon away a part of the foreign exchange or to deprive the Nation of the foreign exchange earned by the exports. Such is the philosophy of Sec. 12. To take the view that the legitimate National interest in the sphere of preservation of foreign exchange has relevance only in the context of transactions of exports for sales and that the Legislature exhibited total unconcern for the foreign exchange earned in the context of transactions of completed sales or consignment sales, is to attribute to the Legislature irrationality. And to impute to the Legislature that it did not know its job inasmuch as it has tackled the problem only partially without any rational basis for excluding the transactions of completed sales from the purview of the legislation which would substantially erode or defeat the purpose of the legislation. When it is equally possible to take the view which would be conducive to the conclusion that there is no lacuna in the legislation, it would be unreasonable to take the view that the Legislature has left a lacuna either by negligence or by lack of foresight or because it did not know its job. In order to escape from the clutches of this answer less argument learned counsel for the Respondent Company contended that in so far as completed sales are concerned, they would be governed by Section 10 1and that the lacuna argument would 1. Duty of persons entitled to receive foreign exchange etc. (1) No person who has a right to receive any foreign exchange or to receive from a person resident outside India a payment in rupees shall, except with the general or special permission of the Reserve Bank, do or refrain from doing anything or take or refrain from taking any action which has the effect of securing (a) that the receipt by him of the whole or part of that foreign exchange or payment is delayed, or, (b) that the foreign exchange or payment ceases in whole or in part to be receivable by him. (2) Where a person has failed to comply with the requirements of sub section(1) in relation to any foreign exchange or payment in rupees, the Reserve Bank may give to him such directions as appear to be expedient for the purpose of securing the receipt of the foreign exchange or payment as the case may be.' 988 accordingly lose significance. It is our firm opinion that Sec. 10 has no application in respect of foreign exchange earnings related to export of goods. Section 10 is designed primarily to impose an obligation on persons who have a right to receive any foreign exchange from a person resident outside India. This section has nothing to do with the foreign exchange earned by export of goods. The entire matter pertaining to payments for exported goods and the foreign exchange earnings arising therefrom in our considered opinion, has been dealt with in Section 12 which is a complete Code in itself. It would be an irrational approach to make to hold that while Section 12 deals with payments for exported goods and foreign exchange earnings arising therefrom in all situations, it excludes from its purview one particular situation namely that arising in the context of failure to repatriate the sale proceeds of goods exported pursuant to a completed transaction of sale. Evidently Section 12 has been very carefully designed. Every possible situation has been conceived of and appropriate prophylactic measures to ensure the preservation of foreign exchange and prevention of syphoning off the foreign exchange, which is very much essential to the economic life of the Nation, have been embedded therein. The entire subject of foreign exchange earnings relatable to export of goods has been specifically and specially dealt with in Section 12. It would therefore be futile to search for an alibi in Section 10 merely in order to support the plea that Section 12 does not take within its fold the foreign exchange earnings relatable to transactions of completed sales. Pray what is the reason or the purpose for doing so? Why take care to deal with 'all ' matters pertaining to export of goods and foreign exchange earnings therefrom in Section 12, but even so exclude for eign exchange earnings arising out of completed transaction of sale from its scope and ambit? When there is a specific provision which can reasonably be interpreted to cover this aspect of foreign exchange earnings also, be embodied in Section 12, which appears to us to be a complete Code in itself. why leave this important vital matter of no less importance to be dealt with by section 10 which essentially deals with foreign exchange receivable from individuals and has nothing to do with export of goods? On a plain reading of Section 10, the matter pertaining to the foreign exchange earned by exports in the context of completed sales will not directly fall within the ambit of it. It will have to be strained beyond the point of endurance in order to accommodate this aspect. Section 10 is akin to a complementary provision which deals with preservation of foreign exchange which does not fall within a specific provision like Section 12. What is more, if completed transactions are excluded from Section 12, the purpose of the legislation 989 will not be served, because sub section (6) of Section 121 which has been designed to ensure compliance with the provisions made in Section 12 (1) to Section 12(5) cannot be availed of. In that event, in regard to the persons who syphon off foreign exchange earned out of the transactions in the context of a completed sale or export on sale they cannot be dealt with under Section 12 (6) and no sanction to ensure compliance will be available. The Act will be thus rendered toothless to ensure compliance with evasion in the context of a completed sale. There is accordingly no compulsion of law, logic, or philosophy, to adopt such a view. We accordingly allow this appeal and set aside the order of the High Court quashing the show cause notices impugned in the Writ Petition by the original Writ Petitioner. The matter will now go back to the competent authority for proceeding in accordance with law. The competent authority will extend the time for showing cause to the Respondent Company and after affording a reasonable opportunity of hearing, proceed to pass appropriate orders in accordance with law as may be called for by the relevant records and the material and such materials as may have been produced, before him in the light of the cause shown by the Respondent Company on merits in response to the show cause notice. It will be open to the competent authority to pass appropriate order uninhibited by any observations which may have been made by the High Court touching the facts or merits of the case or in regard to the incidental matters. We issue this direction having regard to the fact that it was in the first instance for the competent authority to form an opinion on merits on the basis of the relevant material in so far as the factual aspect was concerned. Since the High Court was quashing the notice on a jurisdictional issue there was no occasion for making any observation touching the facts of the case or the merits of the other contentions incidental thereto. We also wish to make it clear that the question regarding the validity or otherwise of the views expressed by the High Court in regard to points other than the aforesaid point regarding the applicability of Section 12(2) have been kept open for decision in future as and when an occasion arises. 12(6) 'For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section and any orders or directions made thereunder, the Reserve Bank may require any person making any export of goods to which a notification under sub section (1) applies to exhibit contracts with his foreign buyer or other evidence to show that the full amount payable by the said buyer in respect of the goods has been, or will within the prescribed period be, paid in the prescribed manner.' 990 We should not be understood as having pronounced on these matters one way or the other. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the order passed by the High Court and dismiss the Writ Petition instituted by the Respondents, with liberty to the parties to raise all contentions on facts and law barring the contention that Section 12(2) of the Act is not attracted.

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal Nos. 4180 and 4181 of 1989. From the Judgment and Order dated 20/21/22 7 1988 and 18/298 1988 of the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition Nos. 3313 and 3417 of 1987. N.N. Keshwani and R.N. Keshwani for the Appellants. A.B. Rohatgi, Mrs. Gool Barucha, M.J. Paul, Kailash Vasdev, R. Karanjawala, Mrs.M Karanjawala (NP) and H.S. Anand for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by OJHA, J. Special leave granted. These civil appeals have been preferred against a common judgment of the Bombay High Court dismissing writ petition No. 33 13/87 filed by Arjun Khiamal Makhijani who is the appellant in one of these appeals and writ petition No. 3417/87 by Prithdayal Chetandas and others who are the appellants in the other civil appeal. Jamnadas C. Tuliani who is respondent No. 1 in both these appeals is the owner and tile landlord of the suit premises comprising two bed rooms flat together with a garage on the ground floor and a store room on Bhulabhai Desai Road in the city of Bombay. A suit was instituted by him for ejectment from the said premises against five defendants on the ground that they were tenants of the said premises and were in arrears of rent for a period of more than six months which they had not paid in spite of a notice of demand having been served on them as contemplated by sub section (2) of Section 12 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and were consequently liable for eviction under sub section (3)(a) of the Act as it then stood. Two other grounds were pleaded by the respondent No. 1 namely that the tenants had changed the user of the suit premises and that they had committed breach of terms and conditions of the tenancy. Subsequently, Arjun Khiamal Makhijani aforesaid was impleaded as defendant No. 6 in the suit on the assertion that the tenants had illegally sublet a portion of the suit premises namely the garage to him and were consequently liable to be evicted on this ground also. The suit was contested both by the tenants as well as by defendant No. 6. The Trial Court recorded findings in favour of the landlord in so far as the pleas of default in payment of rent and illegal sub tenancy are concerned. The other two pleas namely that the tenants had changed the user of the suit premises and had also committed breach of terms and conditions of the tenancy were decided against the landlord. On the basis of the findings on the pleas of default in payment of rent and illegal subletting, the suit was decreed. Two appeals were preferred against the judgment of the Trial Court, one by the tenants and the other by defendant No. 6. Both these appeals were dismissed and the tenants and defendant No. 6 aggrieved by the said decree filed two writ petitions in the High Court. Against the common judgment of the High Court dismissing these writ petitions, the present civil appeals have been preferred. Before dealing with the respective submissions made by learned counsel for the parties it may be pointed out that even though the finding that the tenants were defaulters in payment of rent has been upheld by the High Court, the other finding namely that the tenants had illegally sublet the garage of the suit premises to defendant No. 6 has been set aside and it has been held accepting the case of the tenants that the defendant No. 6 was a trespasser. The tenants had also claimed before the High Court the benefit of sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act as substituted by Amendment Act 18 of 1987 which came into force on 1st October 1987. This plea too was repelled. The defendant No. 6 before the High Court on the other hand took up the plea that in view of the finding in the suit that he was an illegal sub tenant of the garage since 1967, he was entitled to the benefit of sub section (2) of Section 15 of the Act as amended by the aforesaid Amendment Act 18 of 1987. The High Court repelled this plea on the finding that he was not a sub tenant but a trespasser and also on the ground that he was not in possession on 1st February 1973, the relevant date mentioned in the said sub section. The High Court also held that benefit of subsection (2) of Section 15 as amended, could not be given to defendant No. 6 in a writ petition, the same being not a proceeding contemplated by Section 25 of the Amendment Act. In order to appreciate the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, it will be useful to extract sub section (3) as it stood at the time when the suit was instituted and sub section (3) as it stands after its amendment. Subsection (3) as it stood when the suit was instituted reads as hereunder: '3(a) Where the rent is payable by the month and there is no dispute regarding the amount of standard rent or permitted increases, if such rent or increases are in arrears for a period of six months or more and the tenant neglects to make payment thereof until the expiration of the period of one month after notice referred to in sub section (2), the Court shall pass a decree for eviction in any such suit for recovery of possession. (b) In any other case no decree for eviction shall be passed in any such suit if, on the first day of hearing of the suit or on or before such other date as the Court may fix, the tenant pays or tenders in Court the standard rent and permitted increases then due and thereafter continues to pay or tender in Court regularly such rent and permitted increases till the suit is finally decided and also pays costs of the suit as directed by the Court.' After its amendment as aforesaid, it reads: '(3) No decree for eviction shall be passed by the Court in any suit for recovery of possession on the ground of arrears of standard rent and permitted increases if, on the first day of hearing of the suit or on or before such other date as the Court may fix, the tenant pays or tenders in Court the standard rent and permitted increases then due and together with simple interest on the amount of arrears of such standard rent and permitted increases at the rate of nine per cent per annum; and thereafter continues to pay or tenders in Court regularly such standard rent and permitted increases till the suit is finally decided and also pays costs of the suit as directed by the Court; Provided that, the relief provided under this sub section shall not be available to a tenant to whom relief against forfeiture was given in any two suits previously instituted by the landlord against such tenant.' Sub section (2) of Section 15, on the other hand, after its amendment as aforesaid runs thus: '(2) The prohibition against the sub letting of the whole of any part of the premises which have been let to any tenant, and against the assignment or transfer in any other manner of the interest of the tenant therein, contained in subsection (1), shall, subject to the provisions of this subsection, be deemed to have had to effect before the 1st day of February 1973, in any area in which this Act was in operation before such commencement; and accordingly, notwithstanding anything contained in any contract or in the judgment, decree or order of a Court, any such sublease, assignment or transfer of any such purported sublease, assignment or transfer in favour of any person who has entered into possession, despite the prohibition in subsection (1), as purported sub lessee, assignee or transferee and has continued in a possession on the date aforesaid shall be deemed to be valid and effectual for all purposes, and any tenant who has sub let any premises or part thereof, assigned or transferred any interest therein, shall not be liable to eviction under clause (e) of sub section (1) of Section 13. The provisions aforesaid of this sub section shall not affect in any manner the operation of sub section (1) after the date aforesaid.' Since considerable emphasis has been placed on Section 25 of the Amendment Act 18 of 1987, the same may also be usefully quoted. It reads: '25. Nothing contained in the principal Act, as amended by this Act, shall be deemed to authorise the re opening of any suit or proceeding for the eviction of any person from any premises to which the principal Act applies as if such proceeding had been finally disposed of before the commencement of this Act. Explanation For the purposes of this section, suit or proceeding, as the case may be, shall not be deemed to have been finally disposed of, if in relation to that suit or proceeding, any appeal or proceeding is pending, or, if the period of limitation for preferring an appeal or proceeding, as the case may be, had not expired before the commencement of this Act.' It has been urged by the learned counsel for the tenants that 14th November 1967 was the first day of hearing of the suit and since in pursuance of an order passed by the Trial Court on that day, the tenants had deposited the entire arrears of rent on 9th January 1968 within the time granted by the Court and continued to deposit the monthly rent thereafter they could not be treated as defaulters in payment of rent even if the amendment made in sub section (3) of Section 12 by the Amendment Act 18 of 1987 was ignored. We, however, find it difficult to agree with this submission. It is not denied that the arrears of rent which were for a period of more than six months and in respect of which a notice of demand had been served on the tenants under sub section (2) of Section 12 of the Act had not been paid by the tenants to the landlord within one month of the service of the notice. It is also not denied that during the said period of one month, no dispute regarding the amount of standard rent or permitted increases was raised by the tenants. On a plain reading of clause (a) of sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act as it stood at the relevant time, the said clause was clearly attracted and the consequence provided therein had to follow namely a decree for eviction against the tenants had to be passed. Clause (b) of sub section (3) on the face of it was not attracted inasmuch as the said clause applied only to a case not covered by clause (a). This is amply borne out by the use of the opening words 'In any other case' of clause (b). In Harbanslal Jagmohandas and Anr. vs Prabhudas Shivlal, [1977] 1 S.C.C. page 576, these clauses (a) and (b) of sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act came up for consideration and it was held that the tenant can claim protection from the operation of the Section 12(3)(a) of the Act only if he makes an application raising a dispute as to standard rent within one month of the service of the notice terminating the tenancy. In the instant case this had not admittedly been done by the tenants. The consequence of non payment of arrears of rent claimed in the notice of demand was, therefore, inevitable. In Jaywant section Kulkarni and Others vs Minochar Dosabhai Shroff and Others, [1988] 4 S.C.C.p.108, clauses (a) and (b) of sub section 3 of Section 12 again came up for consideration. It was held: 'Sub section (3)(a) of Section 12 categorically provided that where the rent was payable by the month and there was no dispute regarding the amount of standard rent or permitted increases, if such rent or increases were in arrears for a period of six months or more and the tenant neglected to make payment thereof until the expiration of the period of one month after notice referred to in subsection (2), the court shall pass a decree for eviction in any such suit for recovery of possession. In the instant case, as has been found by the court, the rent is payable month by month. There is no dispute regarding the amount of standard rent or permitted increases. Such rent or increases are in arrears for a period of six months or more. The tenant had neglected to make payment until the expiration of the period of one month after notice referred to in subsection (2). The Court was bound to pass a decree for eviction in any such suit for recovery of possession.' Faced with this difficulty, learned counsel for the tenants urged that since the Act was a beneficial legislation the tenants having deposited the arrears of rent within the time granted by the Trial Court and having continued to deposit future rent thereafter the decree for their eviction deserves to be reversed by this Court. In so far as this submission is concerned, it may be pointed out that in Ganpat Ram Sharma and others vs Gayatri Devi, [1987] 3 SCC page 576, while dealing with almost a similar Rent Control Legislation it was held: 'But quite apart from the suit being barred by lapse of time, this is a beneficial legislation, beneficial to both the landlord and the tenant. It protects the tenant against unreasonable eviction and exorbitant rent. It also ensures certain limited rights to the landlord to recover possession on stated contingencies. In Ganpat Ladha vs Sashikant Vishnu Shinde, [1978] 2 SCC page 73 while dealing with the scope of clauses (a) and (b) of sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act, it was held: 'It is clear to us that the Act interferes with the landlord's right to property and freedom of contract only for the limited purpose of protecting tenants from misuse of the landlord's power to evict them, in these days of scarcity of accommodation, by asserting his superior rights in property or trying to exploit his position by extracting too high rents from helpless tenants. The object was not to deprive the landlord altogether of his rights in property which have also to be respected. Another object was to make possible eviction of tenants who fail to carry out their obligation to pay rent to the landlord despite opportunities given by law in that behalf. Thus Section 12(3)(a) of the Act makes it obligatory for the Court to pass a decree when its conditions are satisfied as was pointed out by one of us (Bhagwati, J.) in Ratilal Balabhai Nazar vs Ranchhodbhai Shankerbhai Patel, AIR 1968 Guj 172. If there is statutory default or neglect on the part of the tenant, whatever may be its cause, the landlord acquires a right under Section 12(3)(a) to get a decree for eviction. But where the conditions of Section 12(3)(a) are not satisfied, there is a further opportunity given to the tenant to protect himself against eviction. He can comply with the conditions set out in section 12(3)(b) and defeat the landlord's claim for eviction. If, however, he does not fulfil those conditions, he cannot claim the protection of Section 12(3)(b) and in that event, there being no other protection available to him, a decree for eviction would have to go against him. It is difficult to see how by any judicial valour discretion exercisable in favour of the tenant can be found in Section 12(3)(b) even where the conditions laid down by it are satisfied to be strictly confined within the limits prescribed for their operation.' (Emphasis supplied). When the Act contains provisions, some of which fall under the category of beneficial legislation with regard to the tenant and the others with regard to the landlord, the assertion that even with regard to such provisions of the Act which fall under the purview of beneficial legislation for the landlord an effort should be made to interpret them also in favour of the tenant is a negation of the very principle of interpretation of a beneficial legislation on which reliance is placed on behalf of the tenants. The argument indeed is self defeating and only justifies the cynical proverb Head I win tail you lose. It is difficult to countenance the sentimental approach made by learned counsel for the tenants, for the simple reason that as pointed out in Latham vs R. Johnson and Nephew Ltd., (408) sentiment is a dangerous will of the wisp to take as a guide in the search for legal principles. Reliance was placed by learned counsel for the tenants on Vatan Mal vs Kailash Nath, [1989] 3 SCC page 79. In that case provisions of Amending Ordinance No. 26 of 1975 whereby Section 13(a) was inserted in the Rajasthan Premises (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1950, came up for consideration. After pointing out that the object of inserting Section 13(a) was to confer benefit on all tenants against whom suits for eviction on ground of default in payment of rent were pending and to achieve that object, the said Section had been given overriding effect, it was held that the interpretation of Section 13(a) must conform to the legislative intent and the courts should not take narrow restricted view which will defeat the purpose of the Act. In our opinion, in view of the mandatory provisions contained in Section 12(3)(a) of the Act, the decision in the case of Vatan Mal, (supra) is not at all attracted to the facts of the instant case. Clauses (a) and (b) of sub section (3) of Section 12 of Act are calculated to meet entirely different situations and the object of clause (b) was not to defeat the mandatory requirement of clause (a) scope of which has already been discussed above. For the same reason, the decision of this Court in B.P. Khemka Pvt. Ltd. vs Birendra Kumar Bhowmick & Anr., [1987] 2 SCR page 559 on which too reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the tenants is of no assistance to them. It was then urged by the learned counsel for the tenants that notwithstanding the provisions contained in Section 12(3)(a) of the Act, this Court can still grant relief to the tenants in view of the power conferred on it under Article 142 of the Constitution 'for doing complete justice' in the case. Reliance in support of this submission has been placed on Smt. Kamala Devi Budhia and others vs Hem Prabha Ganguli and Others, [1989] 3 SCC page 145. This submission ignores the basic concept that Article 142 does not contemplate doing justice to one party by ignoring mandatory statutory provisions and thereby doing complete injustice to the other party by depriving such party of the benefit of the mandatory statutory provision. In the case of Smt. Kamala Devi Budhia, (supra), the question arose as to whether an application under Section 12 of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act was competent or in the circumstances of the case only a suit under Section 11 thereof could be filed. It was pointed out that it is the same Court before which both a suit under Section 11 and an application under Section 12 are to be filed and it was in this background that it was held: 'If it is assumed that an application under Section 12 of the Act is not maintainable in the facts and circumstances of the present case, in our opinion, the proceeding has to be treated as a suit and the judgment of the learned Munsif as a decree therein. A further question may arise as to the effect of the Judicial Commissioner, Ranchi declining to pass a formal decree of eviction and directing the appellants to make an application under Section 12(3) of the Act for that purpose. Can this Court restore the decree of the trial court in absence of an appeal by the appellants before the High Court? We think that we can and we should. the question does not affect the substantive right of the parties as the controversy was concluded by the first appellate court in favour of the appellants. What was left was only procedural in nature and inconsistent with our decision to treat the proceeding as a suit. The occasion for filing an application under Section 12(3) can arise only where the matter is covered by Section 12, and as we have made an assumption in favour of the respondents that Section 12 has no application to the present case, there is no point in asking the appellants to file such an application. As mentioned in Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this Court may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, and the present case is a most appropriate one for exercise of such power.' (Emphasis supplied) The said decision apparently cannot be applied to the facts of the instant case. Learned counsel for the tenants then urged, relying on Praduman Kumar vs Virendra Goyal (Dead) by L.Rs., [1969] 3 SCR page 950, that at all events the tenants were entitled to be relieved against forfeiture for non payment of rent under Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act benefit of which could be given if deposit of rent was made at any stage of the hearing of the suit. In our opinion, there is no substance in this submission either inasmuch as Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act cannot be applied to a case where the suit for eviction of a tenant has been instituted not on the basis of forfeiture of lease under the Transfer of Property Act but on the basis of statutory provision dealing specifically with the rights and obligations of the landlords and tenants such as Section 12 of the Act. In a case where a tenant renders himself liable to be evicted on the ground of being defaulter in the payment of rent as contemplated by sub sections (2) and (3)(a) of Section 12 of the Act, bar from the way of the landlord in instituting a suit for ejectment of a tenant is removed and he gets a right to have a decree for eviction. Such removal of bar is not in any sense forfeiture of any rights under lease which the tenant held. Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act which provides relief against forfeiture for non payment of rent applies to a case where a lease of immovable property has determined by forfeiture for non payment of rent. Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with various contingencies whereunder a lease of an immovable property determines. Clause (g) contains one of such contingencies being by forfeiture inter alia in case the lessee breaks an express condition which provides that on breach thereof the lessor may re enter. In a case where forfeiture of lease is claimed for non payment of rent, it would, therefore, have to be established that one of the express conditions of the lease provided that on breach of that condition namely on nonpayment of rent the lessor was entitled to re enter. It is only in those cases where such an express condition is contained in the lease and the lessee breaks the said condition and the lessor on his part gives notice in writing to the lessee of his intention to determine the lease that a lease of immovable property determines by forfeiture for non payment of rent. In the instant case, the suit was not based on any such forfeiture of lease under the Transfer of Property Act but was filed for the enforcement of the statutory right conferred on the landlord by subsections (2) and (3)(a) of Section 12 of the Act. Lastly, it was urged by the learned counsel for the tenants that after clauses (a) and (b) of sub section (3) of Section 12 were substituted by the consolidated sub section (3) of the Amendment Act 18 of 1987, the tenants should have been given the benefit of the deposit of arrears of rent on the first day of hearing in pursuance of the order of the Trial Court dated 14th November, 1967, and of the deposits of future rent thereafter and at all events they were entitled to make the necessary deposit after the commencement of the Amendment Act 18 of 1987. In our opinion, the tenants are not entitled even to the benefit of the amended sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act inasmuch as on a plain reading of the sub section it is not possible to give it a retrospective operation. In this connection, it will be useful to notice that while amending sub section (2) of Section 15 of the Act, it was provided by the Amendment Act 18 of 1987 that the provisions which were substituted in the said sub section, shall be deemed to have been substituted on the 1st day of February 1973. No such provision was made with regard to the substitution of sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act. Sub section (3) uses the words 'on the first day of the hearing of the suit or on or before such other day as the Court may fix'. If the deposit of arrears of rent on 9th January 1968 is pleaded as compliance of the deposit contemplated by the amended sub section (3) and even if for the sake of argument this plea is accepted, the said deposit would still not confer on the tenants the benefit of sub BILLsection (3) for the obvious reason that the said sub section contemplates not only the deposit of standard rent and permitted increases then due but also of simple interest on the amount of arrears of such rent and permitted increases at the rate of nine per cent per annum. Such amount of interest was admittedly not deposited by the tenants either on 9th January 1968 or on any date thereafter. We now turn to the submission of the learned counsel for the tenants that the tenants were entitled to make the deposit contemplated by sub section (3) 'on the first day of the hearing of the suit or on such other day as the Court may fix' after sub section (3) being substituted by the Amendment Act 18 of 1987. This argument ignores the difference between the terms 'at the hearing of the suit' as used in Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act and the term 'on the first day of the hearing of the suit'. In the case of former, it may be possible to argue that the deposit can be made at any hearing of the suit either in the Trial Court or the Appellate Court, an appeal being a continuation of the suit but the said argument is not available in the latter case where the words used are 'on the first day of the hearing of the suit'. In the very nature of things it is not possible to contemplate numerous dates all of which may fulfil the requirement of being 'the first day of the hearing of the suit'. In this connection, it would be useful to notice that the words 'on the first day of the hearing of the suit or on or before such other day as the Court may fix' occurring in sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act after its amendment by the Amendment Act 18 of 1987 occurred in clause (b) of the unamended sub section (3) also. In S.D. Chagan Lal vs Dalichand Virchand Shroff and Others, [1968] 3 S.C.R. page 346 while dealing with the clauses (a) and (b) of the unamended sub section (3) of the Section 12 of the Act, it was held that the date fixed for settlement of issues was September 3, 1956 which can be taken to be the date of the first hearing of the suit for the purpose of the Act. The same meaning obviously has to be given to the aforesaid words when they have been repeated in the amended sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act. The date fixed for settlement of issues in a suit cannot be equated with any other date or dates which may be fixed in the suit or the appeal. The words 'on or before such other dates as the Court may fix' occurring after the words 'on the first day of the hearing of the suit' in subsection (3) of Section 12 of the Act were obviously meant to meet a situation where for some inevitable reason the necessary deposit could not be made on the day of the hearing of the suit and the Court extended the time to make such deposit. A deposit made on or before such extended date would also meet the requirement of the subsection. Even Section 25 of the Amendment Act 18 of 1987 would be of no assistance in so far as the interpretation of Section 12(3) of the Act is concerned. The said Section provides for certain exceptions in which a suit or proceeding for the eviction of any person may be reopened. A provision containing exceptions cannot be interpreted so as to enlarge the scope of sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act. The said Section 25 may be applicable to sub section (2) of Section 15 as amended by the Amendment Act 18 of 1987, the amendments whereunder were given retrospective effect as indicated earlier or also to a similar provision. Clause (a) of the unamended sub section (3) of the Section 12 of the Act conferred a substantive right on the landlord to have a decree for eviction in his favour as held by this Court in the case of Ganpat Ladha, (supra) and such a right could be taken away only by a provision which either expressly took away that right or could be interpreted to have taken away that right by necessary intendment We do not find any such indication either in the amended sub section (3) of Section 12 of the Act or even in Section 25 of the Amendment Act 18 of 1987. By taking recourse to the process of reopening of proceedings one cannot put the hands of the clock back and create an artificial date as the 'first day of the hearing of the suit'. No other point has been urged by learned counsel for the tenants and consequently we find no merit in the appeal filed on behalf of the tenants. We now turn to the appeal filed by defendant No. 6 to whom the garage was found by the courts below to have been illegally sublet but who has been found to be a trespasser by the High Court. As seen above, the High Court in its judgment under appeal repelled the claim of defendant No. 6 that he was entitled to the benefit of the amended sub section (2) of Section 15 of the Act on three grounds (i) that he was a trespasser and not a person to whom the garage had been illegally sublet, (ii) that he was not in possession on the relevant date namely 1st February, 1973 and (iii) that the said benefit could be extended only in a suit or proceeding under the Act and not in a writ petition which did not constitute a continuation of a suit or proceeding under the Act but was an independent proceeding under the Constitution. It has been urged by learned counsel for defendant No. 6 that since the finding of the Courts below that the garage had been illegally sublet to the defendant No. 6 was in consonance with the pleading of the landlord in this behalf, the said finding could not be reversed in a writ petition first, because it was not within the competence of the High Court to reverse that finding either under Article 226 or even under Article 227 of the Constitution and secondly, that the landlord was bound by his admission in the pleading. In so far as the submission that the landlord was bound by his admission in the pleading is concerned, it is true that such an admission being a judicial admission under Section 58 of the Evidence Act stands on a higher footing than evidentiary admissions as held by this Court in Nagindas Ramdas vs Dalpatram Ichharam, [1974] 1 SCC page 242 but on the facts of the instant case to which reference shall be shortly made, it is the proviso to Section 58 which comes into play and the rights of the parties had to be determined de hors the said admission. The said proviso contemplates that the Court may in its discretion require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions. The scope of this provision did not fall for consideration in the case of Nagindas (supra). Reverting to the facts of the instant case it would be seen that there was a triangular dispute in this case. After getting the plaint amended the landlord no doubt set up the case that the tenants had illegally sublet the garage to the defendant No. 6. The case of the tenants, on the other hand, was that defendant No. 6 was a trespasser and they had never sublet the garage to him. In so far as the defendant No. 6 is concerned, the plea set up by him was that he came into possession of the garage in pursuance of an agreement entered into between him and Daulat, son of one of the tenants, for a period of six months. As pointed out by the High Court in its judgment under appeal no positive plea of subtenancy, whether lawful or unlawful was raised by defendant No. 6 in the Trial Court. It is in this background that the controversy on the question as to whether the garage had been illegally sublet by the tenants to the defendant No. 6 had to be resolved. First, since the defendant No. 6 himself had disputed the contention of the landlord that the garage had been illegally sublet to him by the tenants and had set up the agreement with Daulat who apparently had no interest whatsoever in the garage apart from being the son of one of the tenants, a finding that the garage had been sublet to the defendant No. 6 illegally could obviously not be given simply on the basis of the case set up by the landlord in this behalf. Even if defendant No. 6 was permitted to take a somersault and set up a plea contrary to his pleadings, admitting the case of the landlord, any finding given on the basis of such admission would not be binding on the tenants who were contesting the plea of the landlord and had set up a case that defendant No. 6 was a trespasser and that the garage had never been sublet by them to him. Such a finding as aforesaid vis a vis tenants would be a finding based on the admission of the landlord in his own favour. To resolve the controversy as between the landlord and the tenants in this behalf, therefore, an independent finding on merits based on evidence and not on the basis of the plea raised by the landlord had to be given. These are the peculiar facts of this case on account of which the proviso to Section 58 of the Evidence Act was clearly attracted and the parties had to be required to prove their respective cases by adducing evidence de hors the admission of the landlord in his plaint. In so far as the submission made by learned counsel for defendant No. 6 that a finding of fact could not be interfered with in a writ petition by the High Court is concerned, by and large no exception can be taken thereto. The rule in this behalf, however, is not inflexible but has exceptions recognised by judicial decisions which being well known are not necessary to be recapitulated. For instance this rule will not apply if a finding is arbitrary or based on no evidence or is such that no one properly instructed in law could have given it the same being in the teeth of some statutory provision or in ignorance of binding precedents. In our opinion, the instant case is one which falls within the exception to the said rule. It is true that the landlord by getting his plaint subsequently amended set up the plea that the garage had been illegally sublet by the tenants to defendant No. 6. It is, however, equally true that the said plea was categorically denied by the tenants and it was specifically asserted by them that they had never sublet the garage to defendant No. 6 and that the defendant No. 6 was a trespasser. As regards the defendant No. 6 himself he pleaded to have come into possession of the garage for a period of six months on the basis of an agreement entered into between him and Daulat, the son of one of the tenants. In the lifetime of his father Daulat could not have the status of a joint tenant and in the eye of law he had no interest in the garage, apart from using it in his capacity as the son of one of the tenants. He was not in a position either to sublet the garage or even to grant a licence thereof. As seen above, the High Court has emphasised in its judgment under appeal that no positive plea of subtenancy, whether lawful or unlawful, was raised by the defendant No. 6 in the Trial Court. That apart, defendant No. 6 in unequivocal terms admitted in his deposition also before the Trial Court that he came in possession by virtue of the agreement with Daulat, the son of defendant No. 1. He further admitted that he did not know that the defendant Nos. 1 to 5 were the tenants of the flat, store room and garage and that he did not make enquiry as to who were the tenants. This being the situation there was no scope for even drawing an inference that taking of possession of the garage for six months by defendant No. 6 in pursuance of the agreement entered into between him and Daulat may have been with the tacit approval of the tenants namely defendant Nos. 1 to 5. Nothing has been brought to our notice to indicate that the case of the landlord was that the tenants had sublet the garage to defendant No. 6 in his presence and he had personal knowledge about the transaction of subletting. The High Court has also pointed out in paragraph 25 of its judgment under appeal that in support of their plea that defendant No. 6 was a trespasser defendant Nos. 1 to 5 had led evidence and that the lower court had no justification to ignore that evidence. It was apparently, therefore, a case where no one properly instructed in law could have come to the conclusion that the tenants had illegally sublet the garage to defendant No. 6. In this state of affairs it cannot obviously be said that the High Court committed any error in holding that defendant No. 6 was a trespasser. This being so, defendant No. 6 indisputably could not derive any benefit out of the amended subsection (2) of Section 15 of the Act. The finding of the High Court that defendant No. 6 was not in possession on the relevant date namely 1st February, 1973 was based on the circumstance that on that date admittedly the garage was in possession of a receiver appointed by the Court and not in possession of defendant No. 6. It has been urged by learned counsel for defendant No. 6 that possession of the receiver would enure to the benefit of defendant No. 6. This proposition has been contested by the learned counsel for the landlord. We, however, do not find it necessary to go into this question in view of our conclusion that the finding of the High Court that the garage had not illegally been sublet to defendant No. 6 and that the said defendant was a trespasser is unassailable. Even if the submission of learned counsel for defendant No. 6 in this behalf is accepted the nature of possession of defendant No. 6 on 1st February 1973 would be in no way better than of a trespasser. For the same reason, we find it unnecessary to go into the correctness or otherwise of the view of the High Court that a writ petition being an independent proceeding was not a proceeding in relation to a suit or proceeding under the Act. It was lastly urged by learned counsel for defendant No. 6 that after the judgment had been delivered by the High Court on 22 July 1988 dismissing the two writ petitions it was not open to the High Court to reopen and hear the writ petitions on 18 August 1988 and 29 August 1988. So far as this submission is concerned it may be pointed out that the very first sentence of the order of the High Court dated 18 August 1988 indicates that the judgment had not been delivered earlier but had only been dictated and the transcript was ready. Listing the matter again for further hearing became necessary inasmuch as while dictating the judgment a factual position was noticed that defendant No. 4 had died and there was nothing to show that his heirs had been brought on record. Learned counsel for the parties appeared on that date and an affidavit was taken on record. They prayed for time to make submissions on the said question. The matter was ordered to stand over till 29 August 1988 and in the meantime an affidavit in reply to the affidavit taken on record as aforesaid was permitted to be filed. Time given to defendant No. 1 to file affidavit in support of the undertaking given by him earlier was also extended to 29 August 1988. This submission also made by learned counsel for defendant No. 6 has, therefore, no substance. In view of the foregoing discussion, there is no merit even in the appeal filed by defendant No.6. In the result, both the appeals fail and are dismissed. In the circumstances of the case, however, there shall be no order as to costs. R.N.J. Appeals dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 18 of 1952. Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated December 12, 1949, of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (Weston and Shah JJ.) in First Appeal No. 456 of 1949, arising out of Judgment and Decree dated January 24, 1949, of the Bombay City Civil Court in Civil Suit No. 106 of 1948. M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (S.B. Jathar with him) for the appellant. N. P. Engineer (E. H. Bhaba with him) for the respondent. November 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J. This is an appeal filed with the special leave of this Court. It is directed against the judgment and decree passed December 2, 1949, by a Division Bench (Weston and Shah JJ.) of the Bombay High Court reversing, on the ground of absence of jurisdiction, the judgment and decree for possession passed January 24, 1949, by the Bombay City Civil Court and directing the return of the plaint for presentation to the proper Court. There is no dispute as to the facts material for the purposes of this appeal. On or about April 15, 1908, the Board of Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay put up to auction plots Nos. 16, 17 and 18 of new survey Nos. 8234, 8235 and 8244 situate on the Princess Street Estate of the Board containing an area of 2235 square yards for being let on certain conditions. One Sitaram Luxman was the highest bidder and was declared the tenant at an annual rent per square yard to be calculated at the rate of 4½ per cent of Rs. 29 per square yard and he signed the memorandum of agreement incorporating the conditions upon which the auction was held and by which he agreed to be bound. He deposited the moneys in terms of clause 3 of the conditions, and upon such payment entered into possession of the plots. By clause 7 Sitaram Luxman agreed, within the time specified therein, to build and complete at a cost of not less than Rs. 50,000 a building consisting of 5 floors with suitable offices, drains etc. according to plans and specifications to be made by an approved architect and approved by the Board. By clause 17 he agreed, so soon as the main building should be roofed in, to insure in the joint names of the Board and of himself and, until the granting of the lease thereinafter provided, keep insured the buildings and works on the plots for the full value thereof. Clause 18 of the conditions was as follows: '18. The lease. Immediately after the completion within the time limited by condition 7 of the said buildings and works to the satisfaction of the Trust Engineer testified by his certificate the Trustees will if the contract has not previously been determined grant to the tenant or his approved nominee who shall accept the same a lease of the said plot with buildings thereon for the term of 999 years from the date of the auction at the yearly rent calculated in accordance with the accepted bidding for the plot.' Clause 25 gave power to the Board, if the buildings were not completely finished within the stipulated time and certain other contingencies, to forfeit the deposit and to enter upon and retain possession of the plots and all buildings and works then standing thereon. Pursuant to this agreement the said Sitaram Luxman erected on those plots a building which has since come to be known as the New Sitaram Building. On the completion of the building, by an Indenture of lease made April 19, 1916, between the Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay and one Rustomji Dhunjibhoy Sethna the receiver of the estate of Sitaram Luxman appointed by the High Court in Suit No. 720 of 1913, the Trustees, pursuant to the said agreement and in consideration of the monies which had been expended in the erection of the buildings and of the rent and the covenants thereinafter reserved and contained, demised unto the lessee all that piece of land situate on their Princess Street estate together with the buildings erected thereon to hold the same for 999 years from April 15, 1908, paying therefor up to January, 15, 1909, the rent of Re. 1 and during the remainder of the term the yearly rent of Rs. 2,916 by equal quarterly payments. By the said Indenture the lessee covenanted to pay all rates and taxes, not to use or to permit to be used, without the lessor's consent, the portion of land not built upon except as open space, not to pull down, add to or alter the buildings without such consent, to keep in repair all drains sewers etc., to repair, pave, cleanse and paint and amend all the buildings, walls etc., to permit the lessors and their employees to enter upon the premises to inspect the conditions thereof on 48 hours' notice, to use the demised premises for residential purposes or as offices and schools only and not as a public house or liquor shop or for any business or trade, throughout the term to keep the buildings insured against fire in the joint names of the lessor and the lessee and to rebuild or reinstate and repair the building if destroyed or damaged by fire or otherwise. There was a proviso for re-entry for nonpayment of rent for 30 days or for breach of any of the lessee's covenants. In 1925 all the properties of the Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay vested in the Bombay Municipality under and by virtue of Bombay Act XVI of 1925. By a deed of assignment made April 26, 1948, Shri Bhatia Co-operative Housing Society Limited, a society registered under the Bombay Co-operative Societies Act, VII of 1921, the appellant before us, acquired the lessee's interest in the demised premises. On June 29, 1948, the appellant served a notice on the respondent before us who was a monthly tenant in occupation of Block No. B/2 on the ground floor of the New Sitaram Building at a monthly rental of Rs. 52-5-9 to quit and vacate the same by July 31, 1948. By his advocate's reply the respondent maintained that he had been paying the rent regularly and otherwise performing the terms of his tenancy and claimed the protection of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (Act LVII of 1947). The respondent not having vacated the block under his occupation on the expiry of the notice to quit, the appellant filed summary Suit No. 106 of 1948 against the respondent in the City Civil Court at Bombay for vacant possession of the said Block No. B/2 on the ground floor of the said New Sitaram Buildings and mesne profits from August 1, 1948, until delivery of possession. After stating the material facts, the appellant submitted that the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 did not apply to the demised premises. The respondent filed his written statement maintaining that under section 28 of the Bombay Act the City Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. He averred that he had performed and observed all the conditions of his tenancy and was ready and willing to do so, that the New Sitaram Building had been constructed at the expense of the appellant's predecessor in title and that the premises belonged to the appellant and not to the Government or a local authority and that the respondent was entitled to the protection of the Bombay Act LVII of 1947. Leaving out the issue as to whether the appellant was entitled to any compensation, there were 4 issues raising in effect two points, namely, (1) whether the Court had jurisdiction and (2) whether the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 applied to the premises in suit. The learned City Civil Court Judge in a well-considered and careful judgment answered the issues in favour of the appellant and decreed the suit. The respondent appealed to the High Court. The High Court reversed the decision of the trial Judge and holding that the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 did apply to the premises and consequently that the City Civil Court, by virtue of section 28 of that Act, had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, directed that the plaint be returned to the appellant for being filed in the proper Court. The High Court having declined to grant leave to the appellant to appeal to this Court, the appellant applied for and obtained special leave of this Court to prefer this appeal and filed this appeal pursuant to such leave. Learned counsel for the respondent took a preliminary objection, founded on the provisions of section 28 of the Bombay Act, that the City Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, for that section clearly states that in Greater Bombay the Court of Small Causes alone shall have jurisdiction to entertain and try any suit between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery of rent or possession of any premises to which any of the provisions of that Part of the Act applied and to decide any application made under the Act and to deal with any claim or question arising out of the Act and no other Court should have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding or to deal with such claim or question. If, as contended for by the appellant, the Act does not apply to the premises, then section 28 which is an integral part of the Act and takes away the jurisdiction of all Courts other than the Small Causes Court in Greater Bombay cannot obviously be invoked by the respondent. The crucial point, therefore, in order to determine the question of the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court to entertain the suit, is to ascertain whether, in view of section 4 of the Act, the Act applies to the premises at all. If it does, the City Civil Court has no jurisdiction but if it does not, then it has such jurisdiction. The question at once arises as to who is to decide this point in controversy. It is well settled that a Civil Court has inherent power to decide the question of its own jurisdiction, although, as a result of its enquiry, it may turn out that it has no jurisdiction over the suit. Accordingly we think, in agreement with the High Court, that this preliminary objection is not well founded in principle or authority and should be rejected. The main controversy between the parties is as to whether the Act applies to the demised premises. The solution of that controversy depends upon a true construction of section 4 (1) of the Bombay Act LVII of 1947, which runs as follows: '4. (1) This Act shall not apply to any premises belonging to the Government or a local authority or apply as against the Government to any tenancy or other like relationship created by a grant from the Government in respect of premises, taken on lease or requisitioned by the Government; but it shall apply in respect of premises let to the Government or a local authority.' It is clear that the above sub-section has three parts, namely (1) This Act shall not apply to premises belonging to the Government or a local authority, (2) This Act shall not apply as against the Government to any tenancy or other like relationship created by a grant from the Government in respect of premises taken on lease or requisitioned by the Government, (3) This Act shall apply in respect of premises let out to the Government or a local authority. The contention of the appellant Society is that the demised premises belonged to the Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay and now belong to the Bombay Municipality both of which bodies are local authorities and, therefore, the Act does not apply to the demised premises. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, urges that the object of the Act, as recited in the preamble, is inter alia, to control rent. It follows, therefore, that the object of the legislation was that the provisions of the Act would be applicable only as between the landlord and tenant. Section 4 (1) provides for an exemption from or exception to that general object. The purpose of the first two parts of section 4 (1) is to exempt two cases of relationship of landlord and tenant from the operation of the Act, namely, (1) where the Government or a local authority lets out premises belonging to it, and (2) where the Government lets out premises taken on lease or requisitioned by it. It will be observed that the second part of section 4 (1) quite clearly exempts 'any tenancy or other like relationship' created by the Government but the first part makes no reference to any tenancy or other like relationship at all but exempts the premises belonging to the Government or a local authority. If the intention of the first part were as formulated in item (1), then the first part of section 4 (1), like the second part, would have run thus: This Act shall not apply to any tenancy or other like relationship created by Government or local authority in respect of premises belonging to it. The Legislature was familiar with this form of expression, for it adopted it in the second part and yet it did not use that form in the first. The conclusion is, therefore, irresistible that the Legislature did not by the first part intend to exempt the relationship of landlord and tenant but intended to confer on the premises belonging to Government an immunity from the operation of the Act. Learned counsel for the respondent next contends that the immunity given by the first part should be held to be available only to the Government or a local authority to which the premises belong. If that were the intention then the Legislature would have used phraseology similar to what it did in the second part, namely, it would have expressly made the Act inapplicable 'as against the Government or a local authority'. This it did not do and the only inference that can be drawn from this circumstance is that this departure was made deliberately with a view to exempt the premises itself. It is said that if the first part of the section is so construed as to exempt the premises from the operation of the Act, not only as between the Government or a local authority on the one hand and its lessee on the other, but also as between that lessee and his subtenant, then the whole purpose of the Act will be frustrated, for it is well known that most of the lands in Greater Bombay belong to the Government or one or other local authority, e.g., Bombay Port Trust and Bombay Municipality and the greater number of tenants will not be able to avail themselves of the benefit and protection of the Act. In the first place, the preamble to the Act clearly shows that the object of the Act was to consolidate the law relating to the control of rents and repairs of certain premises and not of all premises. The Legislature may well have thought that an immunity given to premises belonging to the Government or a local authority will facilitate the speedy development of its lands by inducing lessees to take up building leases on terms advantageous to the Government or a local authority. Further, as pointed out by Romer L. J. in Clark vs Downes, which case was approved by Lord Goddard C.J. in Rudler vs Franks, such immunity will increase the value of the right of reversion belonging to the Government or a local authority. The fact that the Government or a local authority may be trusted to act fairly and reasonably may have induced the Legislature all the more readily to give such immunity to premises belonging to the Government or a local authority but it cannot be overlooked that the primary object of giving this immunity was to protect the interests of the Government or a local authority. This protection requires that the immunity should be held to attach to the premises itself and the benefit of it should be available not only to the Government or a local authority but also to the lessee deriving title from it. If the benefit of the immunity was given only to the Government or a local authority and not to its lessee as suggested by learned counsel for the respondent and the Act applied to the premises as against the lessee, then it must follow that under section 15 of the Act it will not be lawful for the lessee to sublet the premises or any part of it. If such were the consequences, nobody will take a building lease from the Government or a local authority and the immunity given to the Government or a local authority will, for all practical purposes and in so far as the building leases are concerned, be wholly illusory and worthless and the underlying purpose for bestowing such immunity will be rendered wholly ineffective. In our opinion, therefore, the consideration of the protection of the sub-tenants in premises belonging to the Government or a local authority cannot override the plain meaning of the preamble or the first part of section 4 (1) and frustrate the real purpose of protecting and furthering the interests of the Government or a local authority by conferring on its property an immunity from the operation of the Act. Finally, learned counsel for the respondent urges that the words 'belonging to' have not been used in a technical sense and should be read in their popular sense. It is pointed out that it was the lessee who erected the building at his own cost, he is to hold it for 999 years, he has the right of subletting the building in whole or in part on rent and terms to be fixed by him, of ejecting sub-tenants, and of assigning the lease. Therefore, it may fairly be said that the premises or, at any rate, the building belongs to the lessee and the rights reserved by the lease to the lessor are only by way of security for the preservation of the building which, on the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, will vest in the lessor. This line of reasoning has found favour with the High Court which has held that although in form the building belongs to the Bombay Municipality who are the successors in interest of the lessors, in substance the building belongs to the appellant, the assignee of the lessee, and not to the Bombay Municipality. We are unable to accept this reasoning, for we see no reason to hold, in the circumstances of this case, that the substance does not follow the form. By the operative part of the lease the demise is not only of the land but also of the building standing thereon. This demise is certainly an act of ownership exercised by the lessor over the land as well as the buildings. Under section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act a lease is a transfer only of a right to enjoy the demised premises, but there is no transfer of ownership or interest in the demised premises to the lessee such as there is in a sale (section 54) or a mortgage (section 58). In the present case, the lessee cannot, by his own covenant, use the buildings in any way he likes. He has to use the same only as offices or schools or for residential purposes and cannot, without the lessor's consent, use them for purposes of any trade or business. He cannot pull down the buildings or make any additions or alterations without the lessor's consent. He cannot build upon the open space. He must, if the premises are destroyed by fire or otherwise, reinstate it. The lessor has the right to enter upon and inspect the premises at any time giving 48 hours' notice. All these covenants clearly indicate that the lessor has the dominant voice and the real ownership. What are called attributes of ownership of the lessee are only the rights of enjoyment which are common to all lessees under well-drawn leases, but the ownership, in the land and in the building is in the lessor. It is true that the lessee erected the building at his own cost but he did so for the lessor and on the lessor's land on agreed terms. The fact that the lessee incurred expenses in putting up the building is precisely the consideration for the lessor granting him a lease for 999 years not only of the building but of the land as well at what may, for all we know, be a cheap rent which the lessor may not have otherwise agreed to do. By the agreement the building became the property of the lessor and the lessor demised the land and the building which, in the circumstances, in law and in fact belonged to the lessor. The law of fixtures under section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act may be different from the English law, but section 108 is subject to any agreement that the parties may choose to make. Here, by the agreement the building became part of the land and the property of the lessor and the lessee took a lease on that footing. The lessee or a person claiming title through him cannot now be heard to say that the building does not belong to the lessor. Forfeiture does not, for the first time, give title to the lessor. On forfeiture he re-enters upon what has all along been his own property. Said Lord Macnaghten in Heritable Reversionary Company vs Mullar: 'The words "Property" and "belonging to" are not technical words in the law of Scotland. They are to be understood, I think, in their ordinary signification. They are in fact convertible terms; you can hardly explain the one except by using the other. A man's property is that which is his own, that which belongs to him. What belongs to him is his property.' In our opinion the interest of the lessor in the demised premises cannot possibly be described as a contingent interest which will become vested on the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, for then the lessor could not have demised the premises including the building as he did or before the determination of the lease exercise any act of ownership or any control over it as he obviously has the right to do under the covenants referred to above. The truth is that the lessor, after the building was erected, became the owner of it and all the time thereafter the demised premises which include the building have belonged to him subject to the right of enjoyment of the lessee in terms of the lease. If it were to be held that the building belonged to the lessee by reason of his having put it up at his own cost and by reason of the attributes of ownership relied by learned counsel, then as between the local authority (the lessor) and the lessee also the building must for the same reason founded on what have been called the attributes of ownership be held to belong to the lessee and the Act will apply. Surely that could not possibly be the case, for it would mean that the Government or a local authority will always be bound by the Act in respect of the building put up by the lessee under building leases granted by it in respect of land belonging to it. In that case the immunity given to the Government or a local authority will be wholly illusory and worthless. In our view in the case before us the demised premises including the building belong to a local authority and are outside the operation of the Act. This Act being out of the way, the appellants were well within their rights to file the suit in ejectment in the City Civil Court and that Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit and to pass the decree that it did. The result, therefore, is that we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the decree passed by the City Civil Court. The appellant will be entitled to costs throughout in all Courts. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 219 of 1974. Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 3 3 1972 of the Madras High Court in Writ Appeal No. 416 of 1970. R. M. Mehta and section P. Nayar for the Appellant. A. V. Rangam and Miss A Subhashini for Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAY, C.J. This appeal is by special leave from the judgment dated 3 March 1972 of the High Court of Madras. The respondent in an application under Article 226 of the Constitution asked for a writ of mandamus directing the appellant Unison to pay the respondent pension at the rate of 1s 9d per rupee in accordance with Regulations 934 A and 934 D of the Civil Service Regulations. 862 The respondent is a Ceylonese national. He joined the Indian Civil Service on 6th October 1933. After 15 August 1947 he continued to serve in our country until his retirement on 31 December 1949. At his retirement he was sanctioned an annuity of $ 743 2 shillings 6 pence per annum. He commuted a part of his pension leaving a balance of Rs. 500 per month. Between March, 1968 and October 1969 he resided in Uganda in East Africa. When the respondent was in Uganda he claimed pension at the rate of 1s 9d to a rupee. His request was accepted by the Accountant General, Madras. The Union Government reversed the decision and directed that the conversion rate should be 1s 6d to a rupee and the excess payment should be recovered from the respondent. The respondent thereafter made an application under Article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court accepted the petition of the respondent on the ground that the respondent shifted his residence from Ceylon to Uganda and was, therefore, entitled to benefit under the second proviso to Article 934 of the Civil Service Regulations. The second proviso to Article 934 was as follows: 'Provided that save where a pensioner resides in India (which for the purpose of this Article and Articles 934 A, 934 B, 934 C. 934 D and 935 shall be deemed to include Burma, Ceylon, Nepal, and the French and Portuguese establishments in India) the minimum rate of conversion shall be 1/9 per rupee'. The question of payment of pension to Members of the Indian Civil Service in Sterling was examined by this Court in V. B. Raju & Ors. vs State of Gujarat & Ors. The Constitution (Twentyeighth Amendment) Act, 1972 introduced Article 312 A. Article 312 A confers power on Parliament to make law, inter alia, to vary or revoke prospectively or retrospectively the conditions of service as respects pension of persons who having been appointed by Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council to a Civil Service of the Crown in India before the commencement of the Constitution retired or otherwise ceased to be in service at any time before the commencement of the Constitution (28th Amendment) Act, 1972. The Constitution (28th Amendment) Act, 1972 came into existence on 27 August 1972. Parliament on 21 September 1972 made the law called the Former Secretary of State Service Officers (Conditions Service) Act, 1972. A former Secretary of State officer means a person referred to in sub clause (a) or sub clause (b) sub clause (1) of Article 312 A of the Constitution. The respondent is a former Secretary of State Service officer within the meaning of sub clause (a) of clause (1) of Article 312 A. Section 8(1) of the Conditions of Service Act, 1972 enacts that no former Secretary of State Service officer shall be entitled or be deemed to have been entitled, to claim (a) pension in sterling; or (b) that his pension shall be paid outside India; or (c) where his pension was expressed in sterling or a fixed sterling minimum was applicable in respect of the pension payable to him, that his pension shall be commuted in the rupee equivalent of the amount fixed in sterling at a rate of exchange exceeding the rate of rupees thirteen and one third to the pound sterling. Section 12 of the Former Secretary of State Service officers (Conditions of Service) Act, 1972 states that the provisions of this Act or of any order made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any law other than this Act or in any rule, regulation or order or other instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the 1972 Act. The Constitution Bench of this Court in V. B. Raju 's case (supra) held that the former Members of the Indian Civil Service as a result of the Conditions of Service Act, 1972 are not entitled to claim payment of pension in sterling or outside India or by converting $ 1000 at the rate of exchange exceeding the rate of exchange of Rupees thirteen and one third to the pound sterling. The judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained by reason of change in law. The appeal is accepted and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. Parties will pay and bear their own costs. S.R. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 38 of 1954. Appeal from the Judgment and Decree dated the 14th day of March 1951 of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in M.J.C. No. 230 of 1949. Mahabir Prasad, Advocate General for the State of Bihar (R. J. Bahadur and section P. Varma, with him), for the appellant. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General for India (Porus A. Mehta and P.O. Gokhale, with him), for the respondent. April 18. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J. This is an appeal by the assessee on leave granted under section 66 A of the Indian Income Tax Act. The assessee by name Chatturam Horilram Ltd., who is the appellant before us, is a private limited company carrying on in Chota Nagpur the business of exporting mica for sale to foreign countries. The assessment in question is for the year 1939 40 and the accounting year is the calendar year 1938. These proceedings were initiated on a notice issued to the assessee under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, (Act XI of 1922) (hereinafter referred to as the Act). It is the applicability of this section to the facts of this case that is the sole matter for consideration in this appeal. The circumstances under which the above mentioned notice under section 34 was issued are as follows. The appellant had previously been assessed to tax on an income of Rs. 1,09,200 for the same year 1939 40 by an order dated the 22nd December, 1939, which was reduced on appeal by Rs. 31,315. That assessment was set aside by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on the 28th March, 1942, on the ground that the Indian Finance Act of 1939 was not in force during the assessment year 1939 40 in Chota Nagpur, which was a partially excluded area. On a reference by the Tribunal at the instance of the Income tax authorities, the High Court of Patna agreed with this view and pronounced on the 30th September, 1943, its judgment confirming the setting aside of the assessment. Meanwhile, the Governor of Bihar promulgated Bihar Regulation IV of 1942, Which was assented to by the Governor General on the 30th June, 1942. By this Regulation, the Indian Finance Act of 1939 (along with Finance Acts of other years with which we are not concerned) was brought into force in Chota Nagpur retrospectively as from the 30th March 1939. The relevant portion of the Regulation was in the following terms. 'The Indian Finance Act, 1939, shall be deemed to have come into force in the area to which this Regulation extends on the 30th day of March, 1939'. On the 8th February, 1944, the Income tax Officer passed an order as follows: 'Due to recent judgment of the High Court the assessment under section 23(3) stands cancelled and with it the notice under section 34 issued in this case becomes ineffective and is withdrawn. Assessee derives income from mica mining and dealing, moneylending, mining rents and non agricultural sources of zamindary, and this has escaped assessment in its entirety. Issue notice under section 22(2) read with section 34 again to file a return of income in the prescribed form and within the prescribed time, and inform the assessee that the original notice under section 34 has been cancelled'. It may be mentioned, in passing, that the notice under section 34 which is referred to in the above order as having become ineffective and as, therefore, withdrawn was a prior one which was issued on the 8th July, 1941, i.e., during the pendency of the assessee's appeal relating to the earlier assessment before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal. It is not quite clear from the record in what circumstances that notice came to be issued. But it looks probable that it relates to certain items appearing in the accounts as cash credits to the tune of four lakhs which, as will appear presently, were treated in the later proceedings as concealed income in the absence of any proper explanation by the assessee. This prior notice under section 34, having been withdrawn, has no bearing on the question at issue before us in this appeal and has not been relied on by either side. In pursuance of the order dated the 8th February, 1944, quoted above, a fresh notice under section 34 of the Act was issued to the appellant on the, 12th February, 1944. The income of the assessee company was thereupon determined at a sum of Rs. 4,86,351, which on appeal to the Assistant Commissioner, was reduced by Rs. 11,187. Out of this amount a sum of Rs. 4,04,618 related to two items of cash credits appearing in the name of the partners of the Company which in the absence of any satisfactory explanation, was treated by the Income tax authorities as secreted profits of the Company. Before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal two points were raised. (1) Whether the notice dated the 12th February, 1944, under section 34 of the Act was validly issued. (2) Whether the Income tax authorities were right in holding that the cash credit items were secret profits. Both the points were decided against the assessee. On the assessee's application to refer both the points for the decision of the High Court, the Tribunal declined to make a reference as regards the second point but referred the first for the opinion of the Court in the following terms: 'Whether in the circumstances of the case, the notice issued on 12 2 1944 under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act was validly issued for the assessment year 1939 40?' The question was answered against the assessee by the High Court and hence this appeal before us. The assessee attempted to reopen the second question relating to secret profits before the High Court but the learned Judges declined to allow it to be canvassed, since the Tribunal did not refer the question to them. We are, therefore, concerned in this appeal only with the question relating to the validity of the notice issued on the 12th February, 1944, under section 34 of the Act. It is obvious that if this notice is found to be invalid the assessee would get relief for the entire amount including the amount of secret profits. The answer to the question which arises for consideration in this appeal depends on a correct appreciation of the requirements of section 34 of the Act. Now, it has to be mentioned that section 34 of the Act as it originally stood in the Act of 1922, was amended by Act VII of 1939 and this was in turn amended by Act XLVIII of 1948. At the relevant date, i.e., for the assessment year 1939 40, section 34 (1) as amended by Act VII of 1939 (and before its amendment in 1948) was in force. It was as follows: 'If in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession the Income tax Officer discovers that income, profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment in any year, (or have been under assessed, or have been assessed at too low a rate, or have been the subject of excessive relief under this Act) the Income tax Officer may, (in any case in which he has reason to believe that the assessee has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars thereof, at any time within eight years and) in any other case at any time within four years of the end,of that year, serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income, profits or gains tax on such income, profits or gains, or, in the case of a company, on the principal officer thereof, a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section (2) of section 22, and may proceed to assess or re assess such income, profits or gains and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section. Omitting from the above sub section those portions which are inapplicable to the facts of the present case marked out within brackets it may be seen that the facts which require to be established for the validity of the notice under this sub section are (I ' the income, profits or gains sought to be assessed should be chargeable to income tax and have escaped assess 295 ment in any year, and (2) the Income tax Officer should have discovered it in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that, with reference to the facts of this case, none of these conditions can be said to have been satisfied. It is urged that the income sought to be assessed under these proceedings was not, as a fact, chargeable to income tax during the assessment year 1939 40. It is said that in any case there can be no question of the income having escaped assessment because, as a fact, the income tax authorities did proceed to assess the income and that what happened is that the proceedings became infructuous by reason of the High Court having pronounced them to be void. It is also contended that there is no question of discovery of any relevant fact or information, because the non assessment of the income of the assessee for the period in question was in spite of all the information relating to the income of the assessee having been previously furnished and being in the possession of the Income tax Officer as would appear from the order of the Officer dated the 22nd December, 1939. It is convenient to deal with this last objection in the first instance. It may be true that all the information relating to the relevant income of the assessee which is now sought to be taxed was in the possession of the Income tax Officer in the year 1939 itself when the return was submitted in compliance with the notice under section 22(2) of the Act then issued. But what was required under section 34(1) was not merely fresh information as to the income that escaped assessment but information as to the fact of escapement from assessment of the chargeable income. In the present case the income tax authorities proceeded to assess the appellant in the normal way during the assessment year 1939 40 itself. Those proceedings became infructuous, by virtue of the decision of the Income tax Appellate Tribunal and the decision of the High Court confirming it, which disclosed that the Indian Finance Act of 1939 was not in operation in 296 the relevant area at the relevant period and that in the absence thereof no valid assessment could be made. The fact, therefore, that the income of the appellant for the relevant year remained without any valid assessment emerged only on the High Court finally giving its decision that the assessment proceedings previously taken were invalid. If, in the circumstances, there was 'escapement of chargeable income from assessment' a question to be dealt with presently there can be no doubt that this fact can be reasonably said to have been discovered by the Income tax Officer only when he got definite information as to (1) the passing of the Bihar Regulation IV of 1942 applying the Indian Finance Act of 1939 retrospectively for the relevant accounting period, and (2) the judgment of the High Court pronouncing prior proceedings to be invalid It is knowledge of both these facts, together, that would, with reference to the circumstances of the present case, constitute the discovery of the relevant fact in consequence of definite information received by the Income tax Officer. The information as to both these facts taken together could only be after the decision of the High Court on the 30th September, 1943. As already stated, the notice under section 34(1) , whose validity is in question, was based on the order of the Income tax Officer dated the 8th February, 1944, after the judgment of the High Court was pronounced. That order which has been extracted above, shows clearly that it was in consequence of the judgment of the High Court in the back ground of the promulgation of Regulation IV of 1942 that fresh action under section 34 (1) was being initiated. A number of cases (C.I. T. Bombay vs Sir Mahomed Yusuf Ismail(1); Fazal Dhala vs C.I. T., B.& 0. Raghavalu Naidu & Sons vs C.I. T., Madras(3); and Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy vs C. I. T., West Bengal(,) have been cited before us to show how the phrase 'definite information' and the word 'discovery' used in this section have been interpreted by the various (1) [1944] 12 I.T.R. section (3) (2) (4) 297 High Courts. It is unnecessary to deal with these cases at any length. There is here no question as to any new subjective facts such as change of opinion consequent on a correct appreciation of law by the very same, or another, or higher officer, that is pressed into service as bringing about 'definite information ' and 'discovery'. We are quite clear that the promulgation of the Regulation and the decision of the High Court are objective facts, information regarding which became available to the Income tax Officer when he passed the order dated the 8th February, 1944, and it is only when these facts came to his knowledge, that the Income tax Officer can be said to have discovered that chargeable income escaped assessment in the relevant year. The main question that requires consideration in this case is whether, on the facts, it can be said that 'income chargeable to income tax has escaped assessment in the relevant year'. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that during the relevant year 1939 40 the income was not chargeable to tax as a fact and that the retrospective operation of the Finance Act for the relevant year by virtue of a later legislation does not make a difference for this purpose. To decide this question it is necessary to have a clear idea of the scheme of the Income tax Act and its correlation to the Finance Act of each year. The Income tax Act is a standing piece of legislation which provides the entire machinery for the levy of income tax. The Finance Act of each year imposes the obligation for the payment of a determinate sum for each such year calculated with reference to that machinery. As has been pointed out by the Federal Court in Chatturam vs C.I. T., Bihar(1) (quoting from the judgment of Lord Dunedin in Whitney vs Commissioners of Inland Revenue (2). 'there are three stages in the imposition of a tax. There is the declaration of liability, that is the part of the statute which deter mines what persons in respect of what property are (1) at 126. (2) 38 298 liable. Next, there is the assessment. Liability does not depend on assessment. That, ex hypothesi, has already been fixed. But assessment particularises the exact sum which a person liable has to pay. Lastly, come the methods of recovery if the person taxed does not voluntarily pay'. The same idea has been expressed in slightly different language by Lord Romer in the judgment of the Privy Council reported in C.I.T., Bombay & Aden vs Khemchand Ramdas(1). Chapter III of the Income tax Act headed 'Taxable Income' contains the various provisions with reference to which taxable income is determined. The tax is leviable under section 3 and is in respect of the total income of an assessee in the previous year. The total income is defined in section 2, sub section (15). The application of the Act to the total income in the hands of an assessee is governed by sections 4, 4 A and 4 B and is determined with reference to concepts relating to residence, receipt and accrual, as indicated therein. Section 3, under which the actual charge of income tax arises, is as follows: 'Where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates, tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, this Act in respect of the total income of the previous year of every individual, Hindu undivided family, company and local authority, and of every firm and other association of persons or the partners of the firm or the members of the association individually'. It is by virtue of this section that the actual levy of the tax and the rates at which the tax has to be computed is determined each year by the annual Finance Acts. Thus, under the scheme of the Income tax Act, the income of an assessee attracts the quality of taxability with reference to the standing provisions of the Act but the payability and the quantification of the tax depend on the passing and application of the annual Finance Act. Thus, income is chargeable to tax independent of the passing of the (1) at 428. 299 Finance Act but until the Finance Act is passed no tax can be actually levied. A comparison of sections 3 and 6 of the Act shows that the Act recognises the distinction between chargeability and the actual operation of the charge. Section 6 says 'save as otherwise provided by this Act, the following heads of income, profits and gains, shall be chargeable to income tax in the manner hereinafter appearing, etc. ' while section 3, as already quoted above, says that 'where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates, tax at that rate or those rates,, shall be charged for that year, etc.' Though, no doubt, sections 3 and 4 are the charging sections in the Act as pointed out in Chatturam vs C.I.T., Bihar(1) at page 125, the wording of section 3 assumes the pre existence of chargeable income as indicated in section 6. Hence, according to the scheme of the Act the quality of chargeability of any income is independent of the passing of the Finance Act. In this view, therefore, though, as a fact, on account of the Finance Act not having been extended to the relevant area during the year 1939 40, legal authority was then lacking for the quantification of the tax and imposition of the liability therefor, the income of the assessee for the relevant year was nonetheless chargeable to tax at the time, in the sense explained above. Indeed, it can also be said that the very fact of Regulation IV of 1942, having brought the Finance Act of 1939 into operation retrospectively, in this area, has factually brought about, in any case, the chargeability of the tax during that very year. The relevant portion of the Regulation says that 'the Indian Finance Act of 1939 shall be deemed to have come into force in the area to which this Regulation extends on the 30th day of March, 1939'. By virtue of this deeming provision the Indian Finance Act of 1939 must be assumed even factually to have come into operation on the date specified and the tax must be taken to have become chargeable in that very year, though the actual liability for payment could not arise until proper and (1) 300 valid steps 'are taken for quantification of the tax. The contention, therefore, of the appellant that the income was not chargeable to tax in the year 1939 40 cannot be accepted. The next question that arises is whether the income, though chargeable to tax in the year, can be said to have escaped assessment in the relevant year. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is that since assessment proceedings had in fact been taken during the year 1939 40 by an order of assessment dated the 22nd December, 1939, it cannot be said that the income 'escaped' assessment. He urges that what happened was that, in spite of assessment having been made, the assessment proceedings became infructuous on account of the decision of the Income tax Appellate Tribunal setting aside the same and High Court agreeing with it. He contends that, in the circumstances, this is no more than a failure of the assessment proceedings but that it is not an escapement from assessment. He relied upon the Privy Council case in Sir Rajendranath Mukherjee vs C.I. P., Bengal(1), where their Lordships say that 'the expression 'has escaped assessment ' cannot be read as equivalent to 'has not been assessed' ' and that 'such a reading gives too narrow a meaning to the word 'assessment ' and too wide a meaning to the word 'escaped' '. Learned counsel for the respondent relies on a number of subsequent 'cases of the various High Courts (Madan Mohan Lal vs C.I.T., Punjab(1); C.I. T., Bombay vs Pirojbai N. Contractor(3); and Kunwar Bishwanath Singh vs C.I. T., C.P.(4) ) which have explained. this decision of the Privy Council and pointed out that the particular passage in that judgment which is relied upon bad reference to the, facts of that case, viz., the proceedings by way of initial assessment being still pending. While no doubt the Privy Council case is thus distinguishable, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the escapement from assessment is not to be equated to (1) at 77. (3) (2) (4) 301 non assessment simpliciter is not without force. Here again, it is unnecessary to lay down what exactly constitutes 'escapement from assessment'. For the purpose of the present case it appears to us sufficient to say that, where earlier assessment proceedings had in fact been taken but failed to result in a valid assessment owing to some lacuna other than that attributable to the assessing authorities, notwithstanding the chargeability of income to the tax, it would be a case of chargeable income escaping assessment and not a case of mere non assessment of income tax. The proceedings for assessment in the present case have failed to result in a valid assessment by virtue of a legal lacuna, viz., the fact of the Indian Finance Act of 1939 not having been extended to the relevant area for the relevant assessment year. Learned counsel for the appellant suggests that the failure of the assessment proceedings in this case must be taken to have been due to the lapse of the income tax authorities. It is said that inasmuch as Regulation IV of 1942 was actually passed during the pendency of the reference in the High Court in respect of the prior proceedings, the result would have been different, if the Regulation had been brought to the notice of the High Court. There is, however, no reason to think so. The High Court 's jurisdiction was only to answer the particular question that was referred to it by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal and it is extremely doubtful whether they could have taken notice of a subsequent legislation and answered a different question. Learned counsel for the appellant also urged that in any case the deeming provision enacted in Regulation IV of 1942, may be taken to have validated the assessment proceedings previously taken in the year 1939 and at best to have restored the assessment order passed by the Income tax Officer on the 22nd December, 1939, and confirmed by the Assistant Commissioner. But this overlooks the fact that the order had in fact been set aside by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal and that the setting aside was confirmed by the High Court on the reference made to it. Admittedly the Regulation was passed after the decision of the 302 Income tax Appellate Tribunal. Notwithstanding that the Regulation IV of 1942 purported to be retrospective) it cannot have the effect of effacing the result brought about by the decision of the Income tax Appellate Tribunal and the High Court on reference, unless there are clear and express words to that effect. It might have been quite a different matter, if by the date of the Regulation the assessment pro ceedings themselves were still pending as in fact happened with reference to assessment proceedings in this area, in respect of a number of assessees for the subsequent assessment year, 1940 41, which were pending by the date of the relevant Regulation and were continued up to their termination. They were held to be valid both by the High Court and by the Federal Court when challenged by the assessees. (See Raja Bahadur Kamakshya Narain Singh vs C.I.T., B. & O.(1); Chatturam vs C.I. T., B. & O.(1); as also Chatturam vs C.I.T., Bihar(1). It follows, therefore, that, in our view, the income of the assessee 'Chargeable to income tax escaped assessment in the relevant year 1939 40. The High Court was, therefore, right in answering as it did the question referred to it. The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs. (1) (1946) 14 I.T R. (2) (a) at 126.",

With a view to easing the acute housing problems in the capital city the Authority undertakes construction of dwelling units for people belonging to different income groups styled as Middle Income Group ( 'MIG ' for short), Low Income Group ( 'LIG ' for short), Janta and Community Personnel Service ( 'CPS ' for short). In 1971 the Authority commenced registration of intending applicants desirous of having n dwelling unit in different income groups. Some of the petitioners got themselves registered with the authority in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down by it and made the initial deposits as required by the terms and conditions. Petitioners had applied and got themselves registered for allotment of flats in MIG scheme situated at Lawrence Road. As the number of available flats in this scheme were less than the number of allottees registered, lots were drawn and the petitioners were informed that they have been allotted flats and that each of them should deposit the amount mentioned in the letter of allotment. It appears that the petitioners paid the amount they were called upon to pay and a flat was allotted to each of them and they have entered into possession. Petitioners now contend that the Authority being a statutory body formed with an object of working on 'no profit no loss ' basis and having prescribed a formula for working out the cost price of flats has levied and collected a surcharge from each of the petitioner. According to the petitioners the cost price worked out in accordance with the formula prescribed by the Authority cost of each flat would be between Rs. 51,800 and Rs. 55,600 depending upon the area, extra balcony etc. However, each one of them had to pay between Rs. 56,000 to Rs. 60,000 and that according to the petitioners a surcharge varying from Rs. 3,400 to Rs. 6,000 for a flat has been illegally and unlawfully collected by way of premium or profit. It is further alleged that the 709 Authority has not levied and collected such surcharge from other A allottees of flats in some other MIG Schemes and that this action of levying and collecting surcharge is violative of article 14 inasmuch as persons belonging to the same class, namely, allottees of flats in MIG Scheme have been unequally treated. It is also alleged that there was no valid or understandable justification of levying and collecting surcharge as price of flats comprised in MIG Schemes, between 1976 and 1977, and that from May 10, 1978, this unauthorised surcharge has been abolished. Petitioners also contend that the assertion of the Authority that this surcharge was levied and collected with a view to financing housing projects for lower income groups, Janta and CPS dwelling units so as to provide these weaker sections of the society, houses at a price lower than cost price with a view to making them affordable by such members of the weaker sections of the society, is belied by facts undisputed and that the whole attempt of the Authority, in violation of its avowed policy, was to make profit by levying such illegal surcharge. The petitioners, therefore, prayed for issue of a writ or order or direction declaring the levy of surcharge as illegal and unconstitutional and for a direction for refund thereof together with the interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of levy and collection till the date of refund. In the cognate petition the petitioners are allottees of flats situated at Prasad Nagar and Rajouri Garden under MIG scheme and they complain that in their case surcharge varies from Rs. 19,200 to 22,600. Respondents to the petition are Delhi Development Authority, No. 1 and Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Authoring, Nos. 2 and 3 respectively. In Writ Petition No. 4660/78 the Authority is respondent 1 and Union of India, respondent 2. Petitions were mainly contested by and on behalf of the Authority. The Delhi Development Act, 1957 ( 'Act ' for short), was enacted as its long title shows with the a view to providing for the development of Delhi according to the plan and for arresting haphazard growth and for matters ancillary thereto. It envisages the setting up of an Authority to be styled as Delhi Development Authority which would be a body corporate by the name aforesaid having perpetual succession and a common seal with power 'o acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and immovable, and to contract and shall by the said name, sue and be sued. The composition of the Authority is set out in sub section (iii) of section 3. Amongst others, Administrator of Union Territory of Delhi would be an ex officio Chairman and a Vice Chairman to be appointed by the Central Government. The 710 Vice Chairman may be either a whole time or part time officer as the Central Government may think fit. Section S contemplates the constitution of an Advisory Council for the purpose of advising, the Authority on the preparation of the master plan and on such matters relating to the planning of development or arising out of or in connection with the administration of the Act. Section 5A which was added by amending Act 56 of 1963 confers power on the Authority to constitute as many committees consisting wholly of members or wholly of other persons or partly of members and partly of other persons and for such purpose or purposes as it may think fit. Chapter Ill A which was inserted by the Amending Act of 1963 confers power for modification of the master plain once prepared. Chapter IV provides for development of lands. Chapter V confers power on the Central Government to acquire land for the purposes of development or for any other purpose under the Act under the provisions to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and further authorises the Central Government to transfer the land so acquired to he Authority. Chapter VI provides for finances and audit of the accounts of the Authority Chapter VII provides for supplemental and miscellaneous provisions. Section 52 confers power on the Authority to delegate any power exercisable by it under the Act, except the power to make regulations, on such officer or local authority or committee constitued under section 5A as may be mentioned, by a notification to be published in the Official Gazette in such cases and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be specified therein. One more section of which notice should be taken is section 57 which confers power on the Authority with the previous approval of the Central Government by notification in the official Gazette to make regulations consistent; with the Act and the rules made thereunder to carry out the purposes of this Act. Sub section provides that until the Authority is established under the Act any regulation which may be made under sub section may be made by the Central Government and any regulation so made may be altered or rescinded by the Authority in exercise of its powers under sub section Section 58 makes it obligatory to lay every rule and regulation made under this Act before each House of Parliament in session for a period of 30 days and subject to any alteration or modification therein the rule or regulation shall after expiry of the prescribed period mentioned have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect as the case may be, so however that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the rule or regulation. Petitioners belong to MIG, each of whom registered himself as an intending applicant for a flat in MIG scheme and each of whom has 711 been allotted a flat either in Rajouri Garden, Prasad Nagar or Lawrence Road. Number of persons desirous of having a flat registered with the Authority far outnumbered the available flats with the result that lots had to be drawn and the lucky ones got a letter of allotment to pay the price set out in the brochure in respect of each scheme and to obtain a flat. Each petitioner had paid the price and has entered into possession of the allotted flat. All the petitioners now contend that the Authority has levied and collected a surcharge as part o: purchase price of flat arbitrarily and without the authority of law and has collected the same from them in violation of its object of functioning on 'no profit no loss ' basis and thereby made a huge profit. They further contend that they have been subjected to discriminatory treatment in contravention of article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as no surcharge has been collected from allottees of flats in MIG schemes prior to November 1976 and subsequent to January 1977 except these three schemes and one Wazirpur MIG scheme. Further, no other MIG scheme flats have been subjected to such unauthorised levy of surcharge. It is pointed out that the levy of surcharge has been scrapped in 1978. The petitioners contend that levy of surcharge has no nexus to the object for which the Authority was set up namely, providing housing accommodation at reasonable price by the Authority whose declared policy is 'no profit no loss '. It was said on behalf of the petitioners that even if the Authority was set up for providing housing accommodation to the people in different income groups (keeping in view their financial capacity/affordability) yet a statutory body like the Authority operating on 'no profit no, loss ' basis must have a scientifically prescribed formula for working out its price structure and that must be uniformly applied to all those who apply for flats and to whom they are allotted and such a statutory Authority cannot discriminate in working out the disposal price of the flats by including surcharge in respect of some MIG schemes within a certain specified period, a surcharge not authorised by law and not sanctioned by the Authority as a component of price and unknown to pricing of flats, while others similarly situated and similarly circumstanced and belonging to the same income group enjoyed the benefit cf getting flats at cost price and, therefore, petitioners have been accorded discriminatory treatment in the matter of price of flats allotted to them. Petitioners, therefore, contend that even if they applied for flats anc got registered and were offered flats and accepted the same at the price stated in the brochure and even if it has resulted in a concluded contract yet the Court should not turn a blind eye to such gross discrimination by a statutory authority charged with a duty to provide housing accommodation acting on the declared policy of 'no profit no 712 loss '. It was simultaneously contended that the Vice Chairman of the Authority authorised to determine the prices of flats in each income group has not made any order or has not given any direction for levy of surcharge and that the levy of surcharge was wholly unauthorised. A preliminary objection was raised by the Authority that the petitions are not maintainable under article 32 of the Constitution inasmuch as The petitioners have not come to the Court for enforcement of a t fundamental right conferred upon the petitioners under Part III of the Constitution but the petitioners have invoked jurisdiction of this Court for a relief of re opening concluded contracts. It was also submitted that if the Court accepts the contention of the petitioners they would derive an unfair advantage over others who may not have applied for flats because of the price set out in the brochure and if surcharge is excluded they may have applied for flats at a lower price and, there fore, also the Court should not entertain the petitions. Though we are not inclined to reject the petitions on this preliminary objection as we have heard them on merits it is undeniable that camouflage of article 14 cannot conceal the real purpose motivating these petitions, namely, to get back a part of the purchase price of flats paid by the petitioners with wide open eyes after flats have been securely obtained and petition to this Court under article 32 is not a proper remedy nor is this Court a proper forum for re opening the concluded contracts with a view to getting back a part of the purchase price paid and the benefit taken. The undisputed facts are that petitioners offered themselves for registration for allotment of flats that may be constructed by the, Authority for MIG scheme. After the registration and when the flats were constructed and ready for occupation brochures were issued by the Authority. One such brochure for ', allotment of MIG flats in Lawrence Road residential scheme is Annexure R 1. This brochure specifies the terms and conditions including price on which flat will be offered. It also reserved the right to surrender or cancel the registration, the mode and method of paying the price and handing over the possession. There is an application form annexed to the brochure. Annexure 'A ' to the brochure sets out the price of flat on the ground floor, first floor and second floor respectively. It sets out the premium amount payable for land as also the total cost in respect of the flats on the ground floor, first floor and second floor. The statement also shows the earnest money deposited at the time of the registration and the balance payable. It is on the basis of these brochures that the applicants applied for the flats in Lawrence Road and other MIG schemes. They knew and are presumed to know the contents of the brochure and particularly the price 713 payable. They offered to purchase the flats at the price on which the Authority offered to sell the same. After the lots were drawn and they were lucky enough to be found eligible for allotment of flats, each one of them paid the price set out in the brochure and took possession of the flat, and thus sale became complete. There is no suggestion that there was a mis statement or incorrect statement or any fraudulent concealment in the information supplied in the brochure published by the Authority on the strength of which they applied and obtained flats. How the seller works out his price is a matter of his own choice unless it is subject to statutory control. Price of property is in the realm of contract between a seller and buyer. There is no obligation on the purchaser to purchase the flat at the price offered. Even afar registration the registered applicants may opt for other schemes. His light to enter into other scheme opting out of present offer is not thereby kindised or negatived and applicants so outnumbered the available flats that lots had to be drawn. With this background the petitioners now contend that the Authority has collected surcharge as component of price which the Authority was not authorised or entitled to collect. Even if there may be any merit in this contention, though there is none, such a relief of refund cannot be the subject matter of a petition under article 32. And article 14 cannot camouflage the real bone of contention. Conceding for this submission that the Authority has the trappings of a State or would be comprehended in 'other authority ' for the purpose of article 12, while determining price of flats constructed by it, it acts purely in its executive capacity and 'is bound by the obligations which dealings of the State with the individual citizens import into every transacting entered into the exercise of its constitutional powers But after the State or its agents have entered into the field of ordinary contract, the relations are no longer governed by the Constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines rights and obligations of the parties inter se. No question arises of violation of article 14 or of any other constitutional provision when the State or its agents, purporting to act within this field, perform any act. In this sphere, they can only claim rights conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the terms of the contract only unless some statute steps in and confers some special statutory power or obligation on the State in the contractual field which is apart from contract' (see Radhakrishna Agarwal & Ors.vs State of Bihar & Ors.) Petitioners were under no obligation to seek allotment of flats even after they had registered themselves. They looked at the price and flats and applied for the flats. This they did voluntarily. They were advised by the brochures to look at the flats before going 714 in for the same. They were lucky enough to get allotment when the lots were drawn. Each one of them was allotted a flat and he paid the price voluntarily. They are now trying to wriggle out by an invidious method so as to get back a part of the purchase price not offering to return the benefit under the contract, namely, surrender of flat. I The Authority in its affidavit in reply in terms stated that it is willing to take back the fiats and to repay them the full price. The transaction is complete, viz., possession of the flat is taken and price is paid. At a later stage when they are secure in possession with title, petitioners are trying to get back a part of the purchase price and thus trying to re open and wriggle out of a concluded contract only partially. In a similar and identical situation a Constitution Bench of this Court in Har Shankar & ors.vs The Dy.Excise & Taxation Commr.& ors.has observed that those who contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of the contract along with its benefits. Reciprocal rights and obligations arising out of contract do not depend for their enforceability upon whether a contracting party finds it prudent to abide by the terms of the contract. By such a test no contract would ever have a binding force. The jurisdiction of this Court under article 32 of the Constitution is not intended to facilitate avoidance of obligations voluntarily incurred. It would thus appear that petitions ought not to have been entertained. However, as the petitions were heard on merits, the contentions canvassed on behalf of the petitioners may as well be examined The principal contention canvassed on behalf of the petitioners is that the treatment meted to them by the Authority is discriminatory inasmuch as no surcharge was levied on flats in MIG scheme constructed and allotted prior to November 1976 and after January 1977. MIG flats involved in these petitions were constructed and were available for allotment in November 1976 and the lots were drawn in January 1977. There is one more MIG scheme at Munirka where the allotment took place at or about the same time but in which case no surcharge was levied. The contention is that once for the purpose of eligibility to acquire a flat, the criterion is grounded in income brackets, MIG, LIG, et . those in the same income bracket form one class even for the purpose of determining disposal price of flat allotable to them irrespective of situation, location or other relevant determinants which enter into price calculation and therefore, in the same income group there cannot be differentiation by levying of surcharge in some cases and charging only the cost price in other cases and that the discrimination is thus writ large on the face of the record 715 because by levying surcharge in case of petitioners they have been treated unequally and with an evil eye. It is difficult to appreciate how article 14 can be attracted in the circumstances hereinabove mentioned. Cost price of a property offered for sale is determined according to the volition of the owner who has constructed the property unless it is shown that he is under any statutory obligation to determine cost price according to certain statutory formula. Except the submission that the Authority has a proclaimed policy of constructing and offering flats on 'no profit no loss ' basis which according to Mr. Nariman has a statutory flavour in the regulations enacted under the Act, the Authority is under no statutory obligation about its pricing policy of the flats constructed by it. When the flats were offered to the petitioners the price in round figure in respect of each flat was mentioned and surcharge was not separately set out and this price has been accepted by the petitioners. The obligation that regulations are binding on the Authority and have provided for a statutory price fixation formula on 'no profit no loss ' basis will be presently examined but save this the Authority is under no obligation to fix price of different flats in differed schemes albeit in the same income group at the same level or by any particular statutory or binding formula. The Authority having the trappings of a State might be covered by the expression 'other authority ' in article 12 and would certainly be precluded from according discriminatory treatment to persons offering to purchase flats in the same scheme. Those who opt to take flats in a particular income wise area wise scheme in which all flats came up together as one project, may form a class and any discriminatory treatment in the same class may attract article 14. But to say that throughout its course of existence the Authority would be bound to offer flats income groupwise according to the same price formula is to expect the Authority to ignore time, situation, location and other relevant factors which all enter the price structure. In price fixation executive has a wide discretion and is only answerable provided there is any statutory control over its policy of price fixation and it is not the function of the Court to sit in judgment over such matters of economic policy as must be necessarily left to the Government of the day to decide. The experts alone can work out the mechanics of price determination; Court can certainly not be expected to decide without ' the assistance of the experts (See Prag Ice & oil Mills and Anr.vs Union of India) In the leading judgment it has been observed that mechanics of price fixation have necessarily to be left to the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostile discrimination against a class the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid. 716 This Court in Avinder Singh vs State of Punjab,(l) approved the following dictum of Willis on Constitutional Law, page 587: 'The State does not have to tax everything in order to tax something. It is allowed to pick and choose districts, objects, persons, methods and even rates for taxation if it does so reasonably . The Supreme Court has been practical and has permitted a very wide latitude in classification for taxation. What is forbidden by article 14 is discrimination amongst persons of the same class and for the purposes of allotment of flats scheme wise, allottees of flats in the same scheme, not different schemes in the same income bracket, will have to be treated as a class and unless in each such class there is unequal treatment or unreasonable or arbitrary treatment, the complaint that article 14 is violated cannot be entertained. Therefore, in the State of Gujarat & Another vs Shri Ambica Mills Ltd., Ahmedabad, etc., Mathew, J., speaking for the Court observed as under: 'A reasonable classification is one which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not. The question then is what does the phrase 'similarly situated ' mean ? The answer to the question is that we must look beyond the classification to the purpose of the law. A reasonable classification is one which includes all persons who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose of the law. The purpose of a law may be either the elimination of a public mischief or the achievement of some positive public good.' ' Is the classification income wise scheme wise violative of article 14 in any manner ? The Authority formulates income wise area wise schemes for constructing flats. Petitioners contend that there should be only income wise classification wholly ignoring area and time factor for classification. They say that allottees of flats in all MIG schemes irrespective of area and location and irrespective of when the flats were constructed form one class for determining price of flats. There is no merit in this contenting. What are price determinants ? Price of land, building material, labour charges and cost of transport, quality and availability of land, supervision and management charges are all variable factors that enter into price fixation. Their cost varies time wise, place wise, availability wise. All these uncertain factors cannot 717 be overlooked for the purpose of classification. Therefore, it is not possible to hold that allottees of flats in MIG scheme at any place and executed at any time will form one class for the purpose of pricing policy only valid basis for classification would be income wise, area wise, time wise, scheme wise, meaning all flats constructed at or about the same time in same area in one project for particular income group will form a class. And there is no discrimination amongst them. Pricing policy is an executive policy. If the Authority was set up for making available dwelling units at reasonable price to persons belonging to different income groups it would not be precluded from devising its own price formula for different income groups. If in so doing it uniformally collects something more than cost price from those with cushion to benefit those who are less fortunate it cannot be accused of discrimination. In this country where weaker and poorer sections are unable to enjoy the basic necessities, namely, food, shelter and clothing, a body like the Authority undertaking a comprehensive policy of providing shelter to those who cannot afford to have the same in the competitive albeit harsh market of demand and supply or can afford it on their own meagre emoluments or income, a little more from those who can afford for the benefit of those who need succour, can by no stretch of imagination attract article 14. People in, the MIG can be charged more than the actual cost price so as to give benefit to allottees of flats in LIG, Janata and CPS. And yet record shows that those better off got flats comparatively cheaper to such flats in open market. It is a well recognised policy underlying tax law that the State has wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that the statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others. It is only when within the range of its selection the law operates unequally, and this cannot be justified on the basis of a valid classification, that there would be a violation of article 14, (see East India Tobacco Co. vs State of Andhra Pradesh). Can it be said that classification, income wise cum scheme wise is unreasonable ? The answer is a firm No. Even the petitioners could not point out unequal treatment in same class. However, a feeble attempt was made to urge that allottees of flats in MIG scheme at Munirka which project came up at or about the same time were not subjected to surcharge. This will be presently examined but aside from that, contention is that why within a particular period, namely, November 1976 to January 1977 the policy of levying surcharge was resorted to and t hat in MIG schemes pertaining to period prior to November 1976 and later April 1977 no surcharge was levied. 718 If a certain pricing policy was adopted for a certain period and was uniformly applied to projects coming up during that period, it cannot be the foundation for a submission why such policy was not adopted earlier or abandoned later. It was, however, said that levying of surcharge runs counter to object for which the Authority was set up, namely, to make available housing accommodation on 'no profit no loss ' basis. The argument proceeds on the assumption that the principle of 'no profit no loss ' implies that in respect of each flat the cost of its construction must be worked out and that alone can be the disposal price of each flat. Principle of 'no profit no loss ' has been explained by the respondents. It IS said that in the over all working, planning and execution of projects which the Authority undertakes as part of development of Delhi, the integral part of it being construction of flats for different income groups the motives and working of it would not be profit oriented but would work on 'no profit no loss ' economic doctrine. This would not for a moment suggest that the principle of 'no profit no loss ' should apply either to every flat or to every scheme or to every piece of land developed by the Authority. It would be impossible for the Authority to function on such fragmented basis and such a policy statement has not been made by the Authority. Of course, some public statement appears to have been made that the overall working of the Authority is on 'no profit no loss ' basis. Respondent 1 has been able to point out that the Authority 's housing scheme, as a whole has been running in a heavy deficit because flats including such as those of the petitioners actually cost much more than the initially determined estimates and by the time flats are ready for occupation initial estimates founded on prevalent market prices of materials and labour escalate and revised estimates have to be made. It is also shown that till Municipal authority takes over municipal services the Authority spends for the same and incurs cost. Apart from that petitioners have not been able to show that the Authority is actuated by commercial profit oriented approach in its overall working. It is, however, necessary to examine the contention whether this 'no profit no loss ' policy statement has any statutory flavour as contended by Mr Nariman. The regulations styled as the Delhi Development Authority (Management and Disposal of Housing Estates) Regulations, 1968, ( 'Regulations ' for short) are framed in exercise of the powers conferred by section 57 and were laid before the Houses of Parliament as required by section 58. Disposal price has been defined in Regulation 2(13) to mean in relation to a property such price as may be fixed by the Authority for such property. There is not the slightest or even a remote reference to 'no profit no loss ' formula for 719 determining the cost price. A quick survey of the Regulations do A not spell out any formula for price determination on the basis of 'no profit no loss '. Whether the power to determine disposal price is in the Housing Committee will be presently examined. Regulations, however, on the contrary indicate that the power to determine the disposal price is vested in the Authority and as price has been fixed by the delegate of the Authority even if it is inclusive of surcharge it cannot be said that it runs counter to the declared policy of the Authority. It is at this stage necessary to examine the contention that in the case of Wazirpur and Munirka LIG schemes which came up during this very period no surcharge was levied and, therefore, there is invidious discrimination amongst members of the same class. Again the argument proceeds that income wise classification alone is valid. Here time wise (November 1976 to January 1977) classification is relied upon. It is an admitted position that no surcharge is levied on MIG flats at Munirka. The affidavit in reply shows that the land on which flats are constructed in Munirka MIG scheme turned out to be very rocky with the result that the construction cost in respect of flats at Munirka MIG scheme worked out at Rs. 456 per plinth area per metre whereas in respect of Lawrence Road it came to Rs. 401.54 p. Only. The Authority, therefore, thought that if surcharge is levied on flats under MIG scheme in Munirka area the disposal price would be very high and would be beyond the reach of MIG. It is in this background of the special facts that 'no surcharge was levied in respect of any flat in MIG in Munirka area. Project wise price fixation cannot be dubbed as arbitrary or discriminatory in comparison with other projects at different places. It was, however, pointed out that 132 flats in Rajouri Garden MIG scheme were disposed of without levying surcharge as component of sale price. It is pointed out in affidavit in reply that those flats were handed over to the Government of India for meeting their needs for staff quarters and that was done in the year 1978. It is also pointed out that the Government charged half the price of the land in respect of these 132 flats and, therefore, surcharge was not levied. There is two fold fallacy in this submission. Government ordinarily is in a class by itself and its needs of staff quarters deserve to be met in large public interest. Government has not got any undeserved benefit at the cost and risk of petitioners. Hence their complaint in this behalf is without merits. It was next contended that surcharge is arbitrary inasmuch as how the surcharge is worked out in each case does not answer any 720 rational, tangible, scientific cr understandable formula. How the figure of surcharge has been worked out has been explained in detail in affidavit in reply. Briefly recapitulating the same, it may be mentioned that initial estimates for 304 MIG flats in Prasad Nagar area were prepared in or about 1971 and the estimated cost was Rs. 1,17,83,200 and that on March 21, 1972, an estimate of Rs 1,09,97,100 was sanctioned. After the work commenced and the actual cost started coming in the revised estimate for 304 flats was of the order of Rs. 2,07,33,000 which was approved by the Vice Chairman on September 18, 1976. According to the revised estimate the approximate disposal cost for each flat came to Rs. 68,202 and the cost of land per dwelling unit was Rs. 7,008. Extracts of original notes of Financial Adviser (Housing) and the approval of the same by the Vice Chairman have been set out in the affidavit in reply. The subsequent revised estimates show that disposal price of each flat would be Rs. 75,200. In the meantime the Income Tax Department wanted to acquire 40 MIG flats in Prasad Nagar area and the same were offered at the price of Rs. 75,000, per flat. Commissioner of Income Tax accepted the price. This became the starting point for working out the disposal price in that period. The difference between the cost price and the disposal price of Rs. 75,000 per flat was treated as surcharge and the purpose was to use the extra money for extending cost reduction benefit to the allottees of flats in LIG, Janata and CPS schemes. Affidavit in reply of the Secretary of Respondent 1 provides further information which show that the cost price would be Rs. 78,000. Therefore, at best the component of surcharge would be between Rs. 1700 to Rs. 2200 in Rajouri Garden MIG flats. Similarly, with regard to MIG flats at Lawrence Road the actual cost price would be in close proximity of the disposal price would be in close proximity of the disposal price charged from the petitioners. It is, therefore, difficult to entertain the contention that even if surcharge could be justified its actual computation is arbitrary and irrational. The next contention is that Vice Chairman had no authority to levy surcharge and that even if he has authorised the same it runs counter to the principle of fixing disposal price incorporated in Resolution No. 209 dated November 26, 1974. The Vice Chairman is to be appointed by the Central Government as per section 3(3)(b) of the Act. It appears that this Vice Chairman is whole time officer and will be the Chief Executive of the Authority. This becomes clear from regulation 3 of the Regulations which provides as under: '3.These regulations shall be administered by the Vice Chairman, subject to general guidance and resolutions of the 721 Authority, who may delegate his powers to any officer of the Authority'. Thus the Vice Chairman, subject to general guidance and resolutions cf the Authority, shall administer the regulations. He can delegate the functions to any officer of the Authority. Regulation 59 is important which reads as under: '59.The Authority may delegate all or any of its powers under these regulations to the Vice Chairman or to a whole time member'. Armed with this power of delegation the Authority adopted Resolution No. 60 dated February 21, 1970 which reads as under: 'Resolved that the recommendations of the Committee be approved and all the powers of Delhi Development Authority be exercised by the Housing Committee and the Chairman, Delhi Development Authority be authorised to constitute the said committee, determine the organisational set up and take (sic) all efforts for implementing the housing and allied schemes'. Serious exception was taken to this gross abdication of its powers and functions by the Authority. The composition of the Authority as set out in section 3 would include such persons as Finance and Accounts Member, Engineering Member, representatives of Municipal Corporations of Delhi and representatives of Metropolitan Council as and when set up. Three other persons were to be nominated by Central Government of whom one shall be person with experience of planning. It is a high power body. Yet it completely abdicated its power and authority in favour of Housing Committee. The Housing Committee will practically supplant the Authority. But the more objectionable part of Resolution No. 60 is that such Housing Committee which is to enjoy all powers and functions of the Authority was to be constituted by the Chairman at his sole discretion because he was authorised not only to constitute the Housing Committee but to determine organisational set up and then make all efforts for implementing the housing and allied schemes. It is really difficult to appreciate such whole sale abdication or delegation of powers by a statutory authority in favour of a Committee whose composition would be determined by one man, the Chairman. By a process of elimination the Housing Committee could supplant the Authority and the Chairman could constitute Housing Committee. Therefore, the Chairman enjoyed 722 a very wide discretionary power. Though Mr. Nariman did challenge the validity of Resolution No. 60, Mr. Chitaley in cognate petition refrained from doing so. Once the power to delegate is given by the Regulations the challenge to validity on the ground of delegation must fail It is, however, necessary to examine the submission whether Vice Chairman could have permitted levy of surcharge as a component of the price of flats in MIG schemes. In this connection it would be advantageous to refer to Resolution No. 20 dated June 18, 1968. Of the Authority by which the recommendations of the Standing Committee, inter alia, empowering the Vice Chairman to approve forms of application as well as to fix the disposal and hire purchase price were accepted. Resolution No. 209 is the one adopted by the Housing Committee. It takes note of the delegation of powers to fix disposal and hire purchase price of flats to the Vice Chairman and further provides that if there is a marginal saving in any scheme the amount is always diverted to subsidies cost of Janata and CPS houses. It seems the Resolution is for information of the Housing Committee and the Housing Committee has merely resolved that the information be noted. The Resolution No. 200 of the Authority with Resolution No. 209 of the Housing Committee sets out clearly that the power to fix the disposal price was delegated to the Vice Chairman and ordinarily such excessive delegation to one man may be galling to a judicial body yet the scheme of regulations and the provisions contained in Regulation 3 read with section 59 clearly envisages such delegation of powers. It is, therefore, idle to contend that the Vice Chairman had no authority to levy the surcharge as component of disposal price of flats. It was next contended that even if Vice Chairman had such power there is nothing to show that he has exercised this power and that, therefore, somewhere without any authority someone has added the surcharge to the disposal price and that, therefore, the levy of surcharge is unauthorised. The submission seems to be factually incorrect. The note of Accounts officer (Housing) dated September 8, 1976, submitted to the Financial Advisor (Housing) shows that the flats have been offered at the rate of Rs. 75,000 to the Commissioner of Income Tax for the Income Tax Department and that should be the disposal price This note was approved by the Financial Advisor (Housing) and ultimately countersigned by the Vice Chairman. There fore, the price of Rs. 75,000 as the disposal price is approved by the Vice Chairman. Even if it includes surcharge it cannot be said with confidence that the Vice Chairman has not approved the surcharge as a component of disposal price. 723 The last contention is that the Authority has made a huge profit by levy of surcharge. In this connection statistical table was annexed to the petition and there was serious controversy about the facts and figures set out therein, by the other side. Having gone through the detailed affidavit in reply it transpires that the contention is without merits. Therefore, there is no substance in the contention that the Authority has made a huge profit. On the contrary it appears that the overall working of the Authority is deficit ridden. These were all the contentions in these petitions and as there is no Merit in any of them the petitions are dismissed. There will be no order as to cost. N.K.A Petitions dismissed.",

Shroff, for the respondent in Petitions Nos. 16, 17 and 73 of 1957. March 9. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J. The judgment in Petition No. 12 of 1957 shall also dispose of petitions Nos. 26 and 27 of 1954, 24 and 437 of 1955, 256 of 1956 and 16, 17 and 73 of 1957. These petitions under article 32 arise out of alleged agreements by which some of the proprietors in the former State of Madhya Pradesh granted to one or other of the petitioners the right to take forest produce, mainly tendu leaves, from the forests included in Zamindari and Malguzari villages of the grantors. Government has disclaimed these agreements and auctioned the rights afresh. The petitioners state that this is an invasion of their fundamental rights. The dates on which these alleged agreements were entered into, the terms thereof and the periods during which they were to subsist are different from case to case. It is not necessary in this judgment to recite the terms of these documents, and it is sufficient to group them for purpose of decision on the bases whether the said agreements still subsist, and whether they are incorporated in a registered instrument or not. Petitions Nos. 437 of 1955 and 256 of 1956 are founded on unregistered documents. The answering respondent does not admit these documents, and contends that they cannot be looked into to prove their terms, in view of the decision of this Court in Shri mathi Shantabai vs State of Bombay (1). Petitions Nos. 16, 17 and 73 of 1957 form another group, inasmuch as the period during which the alleged agreements were to operate expired in 1955. Additionally, the documents on which the claim is founded in those petitions are unregistered. In the last mentioned case, it is pleaded that the answering State Government had recognised the agreements in favour of the petitioner but resiled from that position subsequently, which allegation has been adequately explained by the State Government in its affidavit. The recognition was not in favour of the petitioner but in favour of one Thakur Kamta Singh, who claimed under an agreement entered into by one Vishwanath Singh on a date when he had already transferred his interest in the Zamindari to his son Onkar Prasad Singh. This point was therefore not taken before us at the hearing, and nothing more need be said about it. The main objection against these petitions is that the agreements having expired, there is nothing left to enforce either in favour of the petitioners or against the State Government, and the remedy, if any, of the petitioners is to sue the State and/or the proprietors for the breach. The last group consists of Petitions Nos. 26 and 27 of 1954, 24 of 1955 and the present petition (No. 12 of 1957). In these petitions, the agreements with the petitioners are made by registered documents and the terms during which they are to operate have yet to expire. These cases, it is stated, fall outside the rule in Shantabai’s case (1), to which reference has already been made. They are stated to fall within the decision of this Court reported in Firm Chhotabhai Jethabai Patel and Co. vs The State of Madhya Pradesh (2). In all these petitions, counsel argue that the view expressed in the last mentioned case is correct, while the view in Shantabai’s case (1) needs further consideration. The argument of the petitioners in these several cases is that Government steps into the shoes of the quondam proprietors, and is bound by the agreements into which the latter had entered, before their proprietary rights were taken over by Government. They also raise the contention that the petitioners were not proprietors as defined in the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 (hereinafter called the Act), and thus sections 3 and 4 in terms do not apply to them. These sections, it is contended, do not apply to profit a prendre, which the petitioners enjoy under these agreements. In support of this contention, reference is made to the decision of this Court in Chhotabhai’s case (1), and to the definition of ‘proprietor’ in the Act. Reference is also made to some provisions of the C. P. Land Revenue Act to be mentioned hereafter, to prove that the persons on whom the right to collect forest produce was conferred by the proprietors can not be regarded as proprietors even under that Act. This, in main, is the argument in these cases, and even those petitioners whose agreements are incorporated in unregistered documents or whose agreements have since expired, adopted the same line of argument denying the necessity for registration of such agreements. The matter in so far as it relates to the first two groups is simple. It has already been ruled in Shantabai’s case (2) that if the right be claimed on foot of an unregistered agreement, it cannot be entertained. Such documents were examined from five different angles in that case, and it was held that the document if it conferred a part or share in the proprietary right, or even a right to profit a prendre needed registration to convey the right. If it created a bare licence, the licence came to an end with the interest of the licensors in the forests. If proprietary right was otherwise acquired, it vested in the State, and lastly, if the agreements created a purely personal right by contract, there was no deprivation of property, because the contract did not run with the land. Bose, J., who delivered a separate judgment, also held that in the absence of registration no right was created. In view of the clear pronouncement of this Court, the first two groups of petitions must fail. Petitions Nos. 16, 17 and 73 of 1957 also fail for the added reason that the agreements having expired, the only remedy, if any, is to sue for breach of contract and no writ to enforce expired agreements can issue. This brings us to the arguments advanced in the last four petitions in the third group which were also adopted by the other petitioners, whose petitions we have just considered. All these petitioners strongly relied upon Chhotabhai’s case (1). It is therefore necessary to examine attentively what was decided there. In that case, it was held at p. 483 that: 'The contracts and agreements appear to be in essence and effect licenses granted to the transferees to cut, gather, and carry away the produce, in the shape of tendu leaves, or lac, or timber, or wood.' Reference in this behalf was made to a decision of the Privy Council in Mohanlal Hargovind of Jubbalpore vs Commissioner of Income tax, Central Provinces and Berar (2), where it was observed: 'The contracts grant no interest in land and no interest in the trees or plants themselves. They are simply and solely contracts giving to the grantees the right to pick and carry away leaves, which, of course, implies the right to appropriate them as their own property. The small right of cultivation given in the first of the two contracts is merely ancillary and is of no more significance than would be, e.g., a right to spray a fruit tree given to the person who has bought the crop of apples. The contracts are short term contracts. The picking of the leaves under them has to start at once, or practically at once, and to proceed continuously.' The Bench next observed that there was nothing in the Act to affect the validity of the several contracts and agreements, and that the petitioners were, neither proprietors within the meaning of the Act, nor persons having 'any interest in the proprietary right through the proprietors'. After quoting from Baden Powell’s Land Systems of British India, Vol. 1, p. 217, as to what was meant by ‘proprietorship’ in the Land Revenue Systems in India, it was observed that the definition of ‘proprietor’ in the Act conveyed the same sense. Finally, repelling the argument that the agreements concerned 'future goods', it was held on the basis of a passage in Benjamin on Sale, 8th Edition, page 136, that a present sale of the right to goods having a 'potential existence' could be made. Since possession was taken under the agreements and consideration had also passed, there could be 'a sale of a present right to the goods as soon as they come into existence.' Reference was also made (at pp. 480, 481) to section 6 of the Act, which provides: '(1) Except as provided in sub section (2), the transfer of any right in the property which is liable to vest in the State under this Act made by the proprietor at any time after the 16th March, 1950, shall, as from the date of vesting, be void.' It was observed in the case as follows: 'The date, 16th March, 1950, is probably the date when legislation on these lines was actively thought of, and sub section (1) hits at transfers made after this date. This means that transfers before that date are not to be regarded as void. Even in the case of transfers after the said date, sub section (2) provides that the Deputy Commissioner may declare that they are not void after the date of vesting, provided they were made in good faith and in the ordinary course of management. The scheme of the Act as can be gathered from the provisions referred to above makes it reasonably clear that whatever was done before 16th March, 1950, by the proprietors by way of transfer of rights is not to be disturbed or affected, and that what vests in the State is what the proprietors had on the vesting date. If the proprietor had any rights after the date of vesting which he could enforce against the transferee such as a lessee or a licensee, those rights would no doubt vest in the State.' It was accordingly held that the State Government could not interfere with such agreements but had only the right to enforce rights arising therefrom 'standing in the shoes of the proprietors.' It is clear from the foregoing analysis of the decision in Chhotabhai’s case (1) that on a construction of the documents there under consideration and adopting a principle enunciated by the Privy Council in Mohanlal Hargovind of Jubbalpore vs Commissioner of Income tax, Central Provinces and Berar (2) and relying upon a passage each in Benjamin on Sale and the well-known treatise of Baden Powell, the Bench came to the conclusion that the documents there under consideration did not create any interest in land and did not constitute any grant of any proprietary interest in the estate but were merely contracts or licenses given to the petitioners 'to cut, gather and carry away the produce in the shape of tendu leaves, or lac, or timber or wood'. But then, it necessarily followed that the Act did not purport to affect the petitioners’ rights under the contracts or licenses. But what was the nature of those rights of the petitioners? It is plain, that if they were merely contractual rights, then as pointed out in the two later decisions, in Ananda Behera vs The State of Orissa (3), Shantabai’s case (4), the State has not acquired or taken possession of those rights but has only declined to be bound by the agreements to which they were not a party. If, on the other hand, the petitioners were mere licensees, then also, as pointed out in the second of the two cases cited, the licenses came to an end on the extinction of the title of the licensors. In either case there was no question of the breach of any fundamental right of the petitioners which could support the petitions which were presented under article 32 of the Constitution. It is this aspect of the matter which was not brought to the notice of the Court, and the resulting omission to advert to it has seriously impaired, if not completely nullified, the effect and weight of the decision in Chhotabhai’s case (1) as a precedent. The argument of counsel in these cases followed the broad pattern of the decision in Chhotabhai’s case (1), and we next proceed to consider it. It is contended that what vests in the State is the right which the proprietors had on the date of vesting because section 3 of the Act is not retrospective, and that the agreements are 'in essence and effect licenses granted to the transferees to cut, gather and carry away the produce in the shape of tendu leaves, or lac or timber or wood'. These agreements, it is submitted, grant no ‘interest in land’ or ‘benefit to arise out of land’, the object of the agreements can only be described as sale of ‘goods’ as defined in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, and the grant of such a right is not comprehended in the first sub-section of section 3 where it says: '. . all proprietary rights in an estate, mahal in the area specified in the notification, vesting in a proprietor of such estate, Mahal or in a person having interest in such proprietary right through the proprietor, shall pass from such proprietor or such other person to and vest in the State for the purposes of the State free of all encumbrances'. It is finally contended that the interest of these petitioners is not ‘proprietary right’ at all but a right to get ‘goods in the shape of leaves, lac, etc. We have to examine these contentions critically. Before we do so, it is necessary to set out in brief the terms of the agreements which have been produced in these cases. In Petition No. 12 of 1957 there were two agreements, Annexures A and B. The first was executed in 1944 and granted the right from 1947 to 1956; the second was executed in 1946 and granted the right from 1957 to 1966. These are long term agreements and they are typical from case to case. Indeed, the second agreement was made even before the first began, and the total period is 20 years. In addition to the right to the leaves the documents provided for many other matters. It is convenient to quote only from Annexure ‘B’: 'Before this I had given you a similar contract selling Tendu leaves produce by contract dated 7-7-1944 registered on 12-7-1944. In pursuance of that registered contract, which is for five years from 1947 to 1951 and another for subsequent five years from 1952 to 1956 in all for ten years, you are to remain in possession and occupation of the areas and the Tendu leaves produce till the termination of the year 1956 for which time you continue your possession and thereafter in pursuance of this contract you continue for further period of ten years your possession and occupation from 1957 to 1966 as is usual and customary pruning and coppicing Tendu leaves plants, burning them, and instal Fadis for collection of Tendu leaves and construct Kothas (godowns) for storage of the leaves at your sweet will and choice on any open plot or land within the estate with my permission and you are allowed to take free of all costs any Adjat timber, bamboos, etc., from my forests for constructing them. I shall charge you no further consideration. In the same manner, for the purpose of constructing these godowns and such thing you may according to your convenience (you may) manufacture bricks at any place you like in the vicinity of any rivers, rivulet, Nala or pond at your costs. I shall not receive from you any extra amount as rent for the use and occupation of land that will be used for construction of Kothas, for manufacturing bricks and for locating Fadis (Bidi leaves collection centres). All those are included in the consideration fixed for this contract. All these rights are already conferred on you in the previous contract dated 7-7-1944 and under this contract for the entire contract period. It is also open to you to collect Tendu leaves not only those growing in the summer season but also those growing in Kartik. During the term of this contract, if for one reason or another it becomes necessary for you to sell the Tendu leaves produce and assign this contract to any other person you can do so. But you shall be responsible for me to give my consent after inquiring of the fitness of the intended transferee. However, you shall continue to be responsible to pay to me the agreed amount of instalments on or before the agreed dates; and if the agreed amount of instalment is not paid to me on or before the agreed date, I shall have full right to start proper proceedings in that connection'. In Petition No. 26 of 1954, the period of the two agreements was from 1944 to 1963. There too, the rights were similar to those in Petition No. 12 of 1957, and analogous terms are to be found in Petitions Nos. 27 of 1954 and 24 of 1955. The question that arises is, what is the nature of this right? In English law, distinction was made between easements and profit a prendre and a right to take the produce of the soil was regarded as a profit a prendre. While easements were not regarded as an interest in land, a right to take the produce of the soil or a portion of it was an interest in land: Fitzgerald vs Fairbanks (1). Profit a prendre can be the subject of a grant. Where they take the form of a grant, they are benefits arising from land. In all these cases, there is not a naked right to take the leaves of Tendu trees together with a right of ingress and of regress from the land; there are further benefits including the right to occupy the land, to erect buildings and to take other forest produce not necessarily standing timber, growing crop or grass. The right of ingress and of regress over land vesting in the State can only be exercised if the State as the owner of the land allows it, and even apart from the essential nature of the transaction, the State can prohibit it as the owner of the land. Whether the right to the leaves can be regarded as a right to a growing crop has, however, to be examined with reference to all the terms of the documents and all the rights conveyed thereunder. If the right conveyed comprises more than the leaves of the trees, it may not be correct to refer to it as being in respect of growing crop’ simpliciter. We are not concerned with the subtle distinctions made in English law between emblements, fructus naturals and fructus industriales, but we have to consider whether the transaction concerns 'goods' or 'moveable property' or 'immovable property'. The law is made difficult by the definitions which exist in the General Clauses Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Transfer of Property Act and the Registration Act. These definitions must be placed alongside one another to get their ambits. If the definitions are viewed together, it is plain that they do not tell us what 'immovable property' is. They only tell us what is either included or not included therein. One thing is clear, however, that things rooted in the earth as in the case of trees and shrubs, are immovable property both within the General Clauses Act and the Transfer of Property Act, but in the latter, 'standing timber', 'growing crop' and 'grass' though rooted in earth are not included. Of these, 'growing crop' and 'grass' form the subject-matter of the sale of goods, and 'standing timber' comes within the last part of the definition of 'goods' in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, to be subject thereto if the condition about severing mentioned in the definition of 'goods' exists. It has already been pointed out that the agreements conveyed more than the tendu leaves to the petitioners. They conveyed other forest produce like timber, bamboos, etc., the soil for making bricks, the right to prune, coppice and burn tendu trees and the right to build on and occupy land for the purpose of their business. These rights were spread over many years, and were not so simple as buying leaves, so to speak, in a shop. The expression 'growing crop' might appropriately comprehend tendu leaves, but would not include, Adjat timber’, bamboos, nor even tendu plants. The petitioners were not to get leaves from the extant trees but also such trees as might grow in the future. They could even burn the old trees, presumably, so that others might grow in their place. In these circumstances, the agreements cannot be said to be contracts of sale of ‘goods’ simpliciter. It remains now to consider whether the rights enjoyed by the petitioners can be said to fall within section 3(1) of the Act. That section divests the proprietors of their proprietary rights, as also any other person having an interest in the proprietary right through the proprietor and vests those rights in the State. That section has to be read with the section which follows, and which sets out the consequences of vesting of such rights in the State. The rights which vest can be stated briefly to be (a) all proprietary rights in the proprietor, and (b) all proprietary rights in any person having interest in such proprietary rights through the proprietor. These rights vest in the State free of all encumbrances. Section 4 of the Act provides inter alia that after the notification has been issued, then, ‘notwithstanding anything contained in any contract, grant or document or in any other law for the time being in force and save as otherwise provided in this Act’ the following consequences (among others) shall ensue: '(a) all rights, title and interest vesting in the proprietor or any person having interest in such proprietary right through the proprietor in such area including Land (cultivable or barren), grassland, scrub-jungle, forest, trees, fisheries, wells, tanks, ponds, water channels, ferries, pathways, village sites, hats, bazars and melas; and in all subsoil, including rights, if any, in mines and minerals, whether being worked or not, shall cease and be vested in the State for purposes of the State free of all encumbrances; and the mortgage debt or charge on any proprietary right shall be a charge on the amount of compensation payable for such proprietary right to the proprietor under the provisions of this Act; (b) all grants and confirmation of title of or to land in the property so vesting or of or to any right or privilege in respect of such property or land revenue in respect thereof shall, whether liable to resumption or not, determine:'. If these petitioners can be said to be possessing 'an interest in the proprietary right', then their rights, title and interest in the land determine under the Act, and vest in the State. The petitioners, therefore, contend that their rights under the agreements cannot be described as ‘proprietary right’ or even a share of it. They rely on the definition of ‘proprietor’ in the Act, and refer under the authority of section 2(b) of the Act to the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act, 1917. The definition in the Act is not exhaustive. It only tells us who, besides the proprietor, is included in the term ‘proprietor’. Further, the definitions in the Act are subordinate to the requirements of the context and the subject matter of any particular enactment. From the Act, we know that the proprietor’s interest in forest, trees, shrub, grass and the like passes to the State. The question thus resolves into two short ones did the former proprietors own proprietary interest in these trees, and did they part with that proprietary interest and convey it to the petitioners? There is but little doubt that in so far as the Act is concerned, it does contemplate cesser of all proprietary rights in land, grass land, scrub jungle, forest and trees, whether owned by the proprietor or through him by some other person. The contention of the petitioners is that by the term 'proprietor' is meant what that term conveys in the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act, and reference is made for this purpose to various sections therein. The term 'proprietor' is defined in the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act thus: '“Proprietor” except in sections 68, 93 and 94, includes a gaontia of a Government village in Sambalpur Territory.' This definition does not advance the matter any further. In several sections, special explanations are added to define 'proprietors'. In all those explanations, the term is not defined, but is said to include ‘thekedars or headmen with protected status’, ‘mortgagee with possession’, ‘lessees holding under leases from year to year’ and the like. In addition, there is invariably the inclusion of ‘a transferee of proprietary, rights in possession’, which again leaves the matter at large. See sections 2(5), 2(21), 53 and 68. Counsel faced with this difficulty rely upon the scheme of settlement in Ch. VI of the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act, and the record of rights which consists of Khewat, a statement of persons possessing proprietary rights in the mahal including inferior proprietors or lessees or mortgagees in possession, specifying the nature and extent of the interest of each; and Khasra or field book and Jamabandi or list of persons cultivating or occupying land in the village. These documents are prepared separately. The petitioners contend that by ‘proprietary right’ is meant that right which can find, a place or be entered in the Khewat, and the rights enjoyed by the petitioners are not and cannot be entered in the Khewat because they are not ‘proprietary rights’. They also refer to the schemes of settlement under which proprietors sub-proprietors etc., are determined and offered assessment. In our opinion, these arguments, though attractive, do not represent the whole of the matter. What these documents record and what the settlement operations determine are the kinds of ‘proprietors’ among whom the entire bundle of rights is shared. Every proprietor or sub-proprietor enjoys proprietary rights over land, forests, etc., falling within his interest. The right to forest trees, etc., is the consequence of proprietorship, and indeed, under section 47(3) the State Government can declare which rights and interests must be regarded as ‘proprietary rights’. That sub-section provides: 'The State Government may declare the rights and interests which shall be deemed to be proprietary rights and interests within the meaning of sub section (2).' The second sub-section provides: 'The Deputy Commissioner shall cause to be recorded, in accordance with rules made under section 227, all changes that have taken place in respect of, and all transactions that have affected, any of the proprietary rights and interests in any land.' The matter is made clear if one refers to the provisions of section 202 of the Land Revenue Act. That section confers on Government the power to regulate the control and management of the forest growth on the lands of any estate or mahal. A reading of sub-sections (4) to (8) of that section clearly shows that forests belong to the proprietors from whom under those sub-sections they can be taken over for management, the profits of the management less expenses being paid to the proprietors or to superior and inferior proprietors as the case may be. Sub-sections (9) and (10) provide '(9) No lease, lien, encumbrance or contract with respect to the forest land held under direct management shall be binding upon the Government. (10) On the expiration of the period fixed for the direct management, the forest land shall be restored to the proprietor thereof' Even here, the term ‘proprietor’ is explained by the usual explanation showing the same category of persons as included in the section. From this, it is quite clear that forests and trees belonged to the proprietors, and they were items of proprietary rights. The first of the two questions posed by us, therefore, admits of none but an affirmative answer. If then the forest and the trees belonged to the proprietors as items in their ‘proprietary rights’, it is quite clear that these items of proprietary rights have been transferred to the petitioners. The answer to the second question is also in the affirmative. Being a ‘proprietary right’, it vests in the State under sections 3 and 4 of the Act. The decision in Chhotabhai’s case (1) treated these rights as bare licenses, and it was apparently given per incuriam, and cannot therefore be followed. Even assuming that the documents in question do not amount to grant of any proprietary right by the proprietors to the petitioners, the latter can have only the benefit of their respective contracts or licenses. In either case, the State has not, by the Act, acquired or taken possession of such contracts or licenses and consequently, there has been no infringement of the petitioners’ fundamental right which alone can support a petition under article 32 of the Constitution. The result is that these petitions fail, and are dismissed, but in view of the fact that they were filed because of the decision in Chhotabhai’s case (1), there shall be no order about costs.

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 209/58. Appeal by special leave from the Award dated September 16, 1957 of the Industrial Tribunal No. 11, Ernakulam, in Industrial Dispute No. 34 of 1957. G. B. Pai and Sardar Bahadur, for the appellants. A. V. Viswanatha Sastri and M. section K. Sastri, for the respondents. March 9. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J. The appellant M/s. Peirce Leslie & Co., Ltd., is a private limited company engaged in various enterprises mainly in South India. It started business in this country over a century ago and though it is registered in England almost all its activities appear to be carried on in this country. The principal activities that require mention are the business in cashew nuts which the Company sells after roasting raw cashew nuts purchased in this country and in Africa, and business in coir products and several other country produce like ginger, lemon grass oil etc. A large portion of the products in which it trades is exported to foreign countries. Apart from these trading activities the company is also engaged in agency business including working as managing agents of many companies. For many years the company as a whole had made good profits, though in some of its many lines, losses were incurred. The company has on its pay roll a large number of employees and apart from superior officers in its covenanted and uncovenanted staff both Indian and European it employs in its various lines of business a large number of workmen including clerical staff. The 196 clerical staff alone consists of 882 monthly paid employees. For many years the Company has voluntarily paid bonus to all its employees out of the surplus profits. To the monthly paid employees with whom we are concerned in the present appeal the company paid during the year 1954-55 a sum equivalent to three months' basic wages as bonus. Not content with this these employees through their Union put forward a claim for additional bonus. The industrial dispute thus raised was referred by the Government to the Industrial Tribunal sitting at Coimbatore. Before the Tribunal the workmen claimed an additional bonus equal to seven months' basic wages. The company's case was that the peculiar nature of its activities specially the fact that in its agency business very little capital was employed and the fact that in the cashew business and other produce business the element of risk was unusually great justify material alteration in the Full Bench Formula for ascertainment of the available surplus in several respects. The main alteration asked for before the Tribunal appears to have been that rates higher than 6% of paid up capital and 4% on reserves employed as working capital should be allowed in working the Full Bench Formula in view of the special risks in its business and the further fact that its agency business requires very little capital. These claims were rejected by the Tribunal. The Tribunal also accepted only partially the company's claims as regards rehabilitation allowances for the year and as regards actual amounts used as working capital. Having arrived on its calculations at the figure of pound 55,137 as the available surplus after meeting all prior and necessary charges the Tribunal awarded bonus equal to five months' basic wages in addition to three months' basic wages already voluntarily paid by the company. In making this distribution the Tribunal rejected the company's case that as this claim was raised by only a small percentage of the workmen the entire available surplus should not be treated as available in distributing bonus to these few workmen. The first contention urged in appeal before us is that the Tribunal was wrong in rejecting the company's claim for higher return than usual on paid up capital and reserves used as working capital. The appellants' counsel has taken us through the evidence, oral and documentary, as regards what he characterized as the heavy fluctuations in the price of raw cashew nuts which the company had to purchase and the price in the foreign market of the finished goods. That there is some amount of risk is undoubtedly true. We are not convinced however that the company's business whether in cashew nuts or in any other line is attended with such unusual risk as would justify the provision of more than the usual rate of return. Return on invested capital has always to provide for pure interest plus compensation for the risks of the business. Prevailing interest in the money market yielded by gilt-edged security is ordinarily taken to be a fair index of what should be considered reasonable as pure interest. For many years now this figure has varied from 3 to 4 per cent. If no risks were involved, this percentage should have been considered a fair return on invested capital. It is because most businesses contain an element of risk-some more some less because of fluctuations, on the one hand in the prices of raw material and on the other hand in the effective demand for the finished goods apart from cyclical booms and depressions that an additional return of 2 to 3% is generally considered necessary to compensate for the risks. It is in view of this that a return of 6% is ordinarily considered to be a fair return on the capital invested in the shape of paid up capital. In a particular industry where the risk is appreciably less than usual there will be good cause for providing less than 6%. And similarly, in an industry where extraordinary risks are run more than 6% should reasonably be provided for. If therefore there was reason to think that the appellant company's contention that its business was attended with unusual risks was correct there would have been good reason to allow a higher rate than 6% on the paid up capital and also a higher rate than 4% on the reserves used as working capital. We are not however satisfied that any such unusual risk is run. There is no more speculation in buying raw nuts and roasting the same and selling them than there is, say, in buying raw cotton in the market, spinning yarn therefrom, making it into cloth and selling such cloth, or in buying raw jute, spinning yarn therefrom weaving it into gunny cloth and selling the same. No case for any higher return on the paid up capital or working capital has been made out by the evidence. Nor can the fact that the agency business of the company does not require much in the way of capital be considered to be a reason for allowing a higher rate of return in those lines. If in the agency businesses considerable profits are earned with a small amount of capital the contribution to such earning by labour including both those at the top and those at the bottom is necessarily considerable. There is no justification for compensating the entrepreneur for the fact that with a small amount of capital considerable profits are earned. This brings us to the appellant's case about higher rehabilitation allowance than what has been allowed by the Tribunal. The company put its claim for rehabilitation allowance at the figure of pound 31,780 but the Tribunal accepted only a sum of pound 9,11,250 as the reasonable figure towards statutory depreciation and rehabilitation together. In support of its claim, the Company produced a number of statements prepared by witnesses claimed to be experts showing the replacement value of buildings, machinery, furniture and sundry plants which constituted the fixed capital of the company. Statements are also produced showing the further expectation of life of each of these items. The services of a chartered accountant firm were also requisitioned and we have on the record a statement showing how the figures required for replacement have been worked out for the various items of buildings, machinery and furniture and sundry plants. According to Exhibit E 50, the statement on which great reliance was place by the company, the total replacement value of its assets was RS. 1,08,02,330 made up of Rs. 77,86,350 for buildings, Rs. 18,52,320 for plants and machinery, Rs. 3,63,550 for furniture and Rs. 8,00,110 for sundry plants. Different items of buildings and machinery are put in separate groups according as the replacement is necessary in view of the residual age, during 1955-60, 1960-65, 1965-70, 1970-75, 1975-80, 1980-85, 1985-90, 1990-95, 1995-2000, 2000-2005. 2005 is taken as the last year, as the residual age is calculated from 1955 and the maximum residual age is taken to be 50 years. Exhibit E 43 shows the detailed calculations on this basis how the sum of Rs. 77,86,335 was arrived at as the replacement cost of buildings. Exhibit E 46 is a similar statement in respect of replacement costs of plant and machinery. Exhibit E 29A shows how after taking reserves for rehabilitation for the different groups of buildings into consideration, the rehabilitation charge for the season 1952-53 is worked out at Rs. 19,878 for buildings and the rehabilitation for plant and machinery is worked out as pound 5,435. Details are also given as regards the calculation of pound 4,744 as the rehabilitation costs to be provided for sundry plants and pound 1,723 as the rehabilitation costs for furniture in the year 1954-55. The very fact that such care has been taken in furnishing details to the Court inclines one prima facie to accept the correctness of these figures without much scrutiny. Scrutiny is however very much needed before the figures and the calculations are accepted. Mention may first be made of the fact that though it was stated by the witness who is responsible for the preparation descargar ppsspp apk gratis android 2025 of the replacement costs of the machinery that he obtained quotations from different firms, no such quotation has been placed on record. That, as the Tribunal itself recognized, affected very much the value of these figures. As however after mentioning the infirmities of the evidence the Tribunal decided to accept as a reasonably accurate statement this figure of Rs. 1,08,02,330 as the total replacement value we need not consider whether we ourselves would have been prepared to accept the evidence if the matter was being considered by us in the first instance. A more serious question however is whether the basis adopted by the appellant's expert for the calculation of this sum as the replacement costs to be provided over the years in the application of the Full Bench Formula can be accepted. As the appellant's expert himself has stated the value he has given as the rehabilitation cost for any particular building is on the basis of what would be required to construct a similar building if the existing building was pulled down in 1955. He has proceeded on the same way as regards the machinery and other assets. The Tribunal after accepting the figure of Rs. 1,08,02,330 as the correct figure for replacement deducted the sum which in its opinion was available in the reserves towards such rehabilitation and then divided the remainder by 50 as 50 years would be the period that these buildings and machinery would last if replaced in 1955 by new buildings and new machinery. It has been urged before us that the Tribunal was wrong in dividing the sum obtained after the total amount to be provided was ascertained by 50 inasmuch as the figure of Rs. 1,08,02,330 was itself arrived at on the basis of the sum that would have to be provided for the different groups of buildings and the sum to be provided in 1954-55 for all these different groups should have been accepted at these figures worked out in Exhibit E 29A. It appears to us that this method of arriving at the rehabilitation costs to be provided in a particular year is not useful and cannot be safely relied upon. To understand the fallacy of the method applied we may briefly state the logic behind the provisions for rehabilitation. Because the fixed capital of any industry is the victim of gradual deterioration the prudent businessman creates reserves out of his profits so that as soon as any portion of the fixed capital has become too deteriorated for efficient working it may be replaced. The economic welfare of the country as a whole no less than the interests of the businessman requires that the company's capital fund should remain intact. It is for this reason that an amount reasonably sufficient for the notional requirement of rehabilitation during the relevant year is deducted as a prior charge in ascertaining surplus profits from which bonus can be paid. The basis of the prior charge is the assumption that rehabilitation is a continuing process and so needs allotment from year to year. That is why it has now been held that if the amount allotted for a specific year is not used, it should be taken into account in the later year. This has been recognized in the Full Bench Formula and has received the authoritative recognition from this Court in numerous cases. A full discussion of the principle involved can be found in Associated Cement Company's Case (1). It is important to note what was pointed out there as regards the replacement value being calculated on the basis of what would be required to replace the fixed assets in question at the date when replacement is due. One way of ascertaining that was to multiply the original cost, by the figure which would reflect the expected rise or fall in prices at the date for replacement. After the replacement cost is ascertained it is necessary to deduct therefrom the amount already lying in reserves for this purpose and then to see over what period the balance will have to be found. There will no doubt be difficulties in the way of estimating the replacement costs in this manner, but that cannot justify the attempt at over simplification by working out the replacement cost on the hypothesis that replacement cost at the date of replacement will be the same as on the present date. If the prices fall in the meantime too much will have been set apart for rehabilitation, if prices rise too little. To take the instance of buildings which form the greater portion of the assets of the appellant company, it may well be that by the time some of these buildings require replacement, the cost of construction will have become less than at the present time by reason of more efficient production of cement and steel in the country. So, also the price of machinery some years later, may well be less than the price now, by reason of such machinery being produced in our own country. The layman's apprehension that prices rise never to fall again cannot be accepted as a correct basis for calculation of the replacement cost on a future date. The entire basis of the calculation of the replacement cost by the appellant's experts is what such costs will be if the building was pulled down or the machinery scrapped in 1955 and had to be replaced by a new machinery on that date. His estimate of the replacement cost cannot therefore be accepted as a sure basis for any calculation of the rehabilitation costs to be provided. It is unnecessary therefore to go into the further question as to whether the Tribunal was justified in treating the sum of pound 20,000/ and also another sum of pound 44,760 as available towards rehabilitation. We may however indicate that if it were necessary to go into the question we would have probably hesitated to hold that these sums were not in fact available for rehabilitation. A strict view of the evidence thus justifies a conclusion that the appellant company has failed to make out any case for rehabilitation allowance in addition to the ordinary depreciation. As however the learned counsel for the respondent did not challenge the correctness of the allowance of pound 11,250 assessed by the Tribunal as the total allowances towards statutory depreciation and rehabilitation together it would be proper to apply the formula on that basis. The other question in dispute was as regards the amount of reserves actually used as working capital. Out of what was claimed by the company as reserves employed as working capital the Tribunal disallowed two items. One was in respect of a sum of pound 2,09,339 which appeared in the balance sheet as provision for taxation liability; another was an item of pound 8,250 as provision for proposed dividend on deferred ordinary shares. The Tribunal was of opinion that the company had not made any attempt to prove that these amounts had actually been used in the business. The appellant contends before us that a scrutiny of the balance sheet is sufficient to satisfy any one that these amounts had actually been employed as working capital. It is stressed in this connection that when the balance sheets were put in evidence through the company's officer no challenge as to the correctness of the statement made therein was made in cross examination. Though no direct challenge to the correctness of the statements appearing in the balance sheets about the value of the different assets appears to have been made it is important to notice that the employer's witness No. 2 through whom the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of the company were put in evidence was asked in cross examination as regards the discrepancy between the statements in the balance sheet E 8 where the bank overdraft was shown as pound 1,95,990 and the statement Exhibit E 12 which showed the bank overdraft in June 1955 as 37.5 lakhs which is equivalent to pound 2,75,000. The difference being of about pound 80,000, the witness was asked which is correct, whether E 8 or E 12 and when the witness answered that both were correct, he was asked 'how'. His answer was 'I do not know'. It may be that there is a satisfactory explanation of this difference but the evidence on record does not disclose this. When there remains prima facie such discrepancy as regards the very important figure as regards bank overdraft the Tribunal would well be justified in refusing to base any conclusion on the valuation of different assets as stated therein. There is apart from this the important fact that the company itself does not claim that whatever appears to be on the asset side over and above the paid up capital has come from the reserves. Exhibit E 30 is the statement prepared by the company's Chartered Accountant to show 'Reconciliation of working capital as on 30th June, 1958.' It arrives at the figure of pound 6,05,564 as the working capital by deducting from the current assets as per balance sheet as on June 30, 1955, six out of nine items under 'Current liabilities & provisions', 3 items not deducted are those under (1) liability for taxation other than U.K. Income tax, (2) proposed dividend on deferred ordinary shares and (3) capital profits on proposed distribution. The obvious reason for deducting the six items from the current assets to arrive at the working capital is that these items in the balance sheets under current liabilities and provision would have to be met during the year out of a portion of the current assets, which portion would accordingly not be available for use as working capital. If that is the case as regards the other items under current liabilities and provisions it is not clear why that should not also be the case as regards the current liabilities under 'liabilities for taxation other than U.K. Income tax' and under 'proposed dividend on deferred ordinary shares'. In the absence of evidence to the contrary there is no ground for thinking that these current liabilities had not also to be met out of the current assets during the year. No such evidence has been produced. The Tribunal is therefore right in our opinion in rejecting the company's claim that these amounts were also employed as working capital. As regards the other prior charges there is no dispute. The Tribunal applying the Full Bench Formula on the basis of the different findings hold after deducting the bonus already paid voluntarily by the company that the company had still in its hand a sum of pound 55,137 out of which it could pay a reasonable amount to these workmen. When deciding how much out of this pound 56,137 could reasonably be paid as additional bonus to these workmen the Tribunal had to consider the contention raised on behalf of the appellant company that it would be unfair to ignore the fact that not these staff members alone but 11,247 other workmen as well have contributed to the emergence of this surplus. The appellant's argument was that staff members who have raised this dispute should not be allowed to steal an advantage over the numerous other workers of the company and that just as results of the different branches of the company have been considered as a whole in arriving at the figure of available surplus it is just and proper that these workmen who have raised the dispute should be given only a fair share out of that portion of the surplus which may be considered properly payable to all the workmen of the company. In dealing with this question the Tribunal has said 'But the fortune of the 11,247 workers depend upon the trading results of the department in which they are working; the bonus of the workers is decided compartment wise and not on the basis of the overall profits of the company. Cashew workers are given bonus on the basis of the cashew department profits and not on the basis of the total profits of the company. The staff members are transferable from one department to another and from one branch to another branch.' We are not able to understand how in spite of the way the company's balance sheets and profit and loss accounts have been kept the different departments of the company could be treated separately for the purposes of bonus. The mere fact that the company has actually done so does not make such distribution right. Obviously if cashew workers would in fact be entitled to a larger bonus on the overall results of the company they have been unfairly treated by the company in having been given lesser bonus on the basis of cashew department profits. It is urged on behalf of the appellant that the fact that the workmen other than these staff members have got less than they would have been entitled to does not justify the grant of a larger share to the present workmen than what they would be entitled to if those other workmen had been given a fair share. This Court had to deal with a somewhat similar position in Indian Hume Pipe Co. vs Their Workmen(1). The respondents there were workmen only of the Wadala factory. The appellant had however paid to various workmen elsewhere as and by way of bonus varying between 4% and 29% of the basic wages for the year in question. It was clear that the sum of Rs. 1,23,138/only had been paid in full and final settlement to the workmen in some of the factories and the bonus calculations on an all India basis would work to the advantage of the appellant, in so far as they would result in saving to the appellant of the difference between the amounts to which those workmen would be entitled to on the basis of the all India figures adopted by the tribunal and the amounts actually paid to them as a result of agreements, conciliation or adjudication. On behalf of the respondents it was therefore contended that the calculations should be made after taking into account the savings thus effected. Dealing with this contention this Court observed: 'We are afraid we cannot accept this contention. If this contention was accepted, the respondents before us would have an advantage over those workmen with whom settlements have been made and would get larger amounts by way of bonus merely by reason of the fact that the appellant had managed to settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures. If this contention of the respondents was pushed to its logical extent, it would also mean that in the event of the non-fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the tribunal in the award of bonus herein bringing in savings in the hands of the appellant, the respondents would be entitled to take advantage of those savings also and should be awarded larger amounts by way of bonus, which would really be the result of the claimants entitled to the same not receiving it under certain circumstances an event which would be purely an extraneous one and unconnected with the contribution of the respondents towards the gross profits earned by the appellant. The tribunal was, therefore, right in calculating the bonus on an all India basis.' Though in the present case there has been no 'settlement' strictly speaking with the other workers in the various branches, the considerations which weighed with the Court in the above case are fully applicable to this case and the Tribunal must be held to have committed an error in treating the sum still in the hands of the company as a matter only between the company and these present claimants. In deciding what relief may reasonably be given to the appellant company in view of this error in the Tribunal's approach to the question of distribution of the amount still available, we have however to take into account two errors which have been made by the Tribunal in this connection in favour of the appellant. One of these is that in distributing the available surplus the Tribunal omitted to take into account the important fact that a sum of no less than pound 1,10,000/ has been capitalised out of the reserves at the beginning of the year. The second error was that the Tribunal in saying that after paying 8 months' bonus there is a balance of pound 34,397 with the employer, omitted to take into consideration the fact that the company would also have the benefit of a large amount as income tax rebate in respect of the bonus paid to its clerical staff. Taking all these facts into consideration we are of opinion that a fair order would be to award to the staff bonus equivalent to 3 months' basic wages in addition to the amount already paid voluntarily. We therefore allow the appeal in part and in modification of the award made by the Industrial Tribunal award to the staff of M/s. Peirce Leslie Co., Ltd., bonus equivalent to 3 months' basic wages in addition to the amount already voluntarily paid by the company. There will be no order as to costs. Appeal partly allowed.",

        "judgement": "Appeals Nos. 436 to 438 of 1961. Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 9, 1959, of the Punjab High Court in Letters Patent Appeals Nos. 407, 408 and 409 of 1959. Achhru Ram and B. D. Jain, for the appellants. Gian Singh Vohra, for the respondents. October 4. The Judgement of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J. What is the effect of the retrospective operation of section 31 introduced by the Punjab Pre emption (Amendment) Act, 1960 (X of 1960) in the parent Act of Pre emption (No. 1 of 1913). That is the short question which arises for our decision in these three appeals which have been ordered to be consolidated for the purpose of hearing by this Court. These appeals arise from three pre emption suits instituted by the respondents against the respective appellants. The respondents' case was that the properties in suit had been sold by Aftab Rai on May 31, 1956, for Rs. 10,000/ to the appellants and it is these sales which they wanted to preempt. They alleged that they are the owners of agricultural land in Patti Aulakli and Patti Rode, in Mauza Marahar Kalan, and as such, they had the statutory right to claim pre emption, under section 15(c) (ii) and (iii). The appellants resisted this claim on the ground that the respective vendees from Aftab Rai had transferred by exchanges about 2 kenals out of the lands purchased by them and as a result of the said exchanges the appellants had themselves become entitled to preempt the said sales under the same statutory provision. Since the appellants had acquired equal status with the respondents who claimed to be the preemptors, their claim for pre emption cannot be sustained. That, in brief, was the nature of the contest between the parties. The trial Court held that the exchanges on which the appellants relied had not been proved and so, it gave effect to the respondents' right to preempt under section 15(c) (ii) & (iii). The appellants took the matter before the Addl. District Judge in appeal. The lower appellate Court was pleased to admit additional evidence under 0.41, r. 27, of the Code of Civil Procedure and held that the exchanges in question had in fact been proved and were, in law, valid. It, therefore came to the conclusion that the appellants acquired equal status with the respondents and so, the respondents' claim for pre emption must fail. That is why the appeals preferred by the appellants were allowed and the respondents' suits were dismissed. The dispute was then taken up before the High Court of Punjab by the respondents by second appeals. Mahajan, J., who heard these appeals held that the property acquired by exchange in lieu of the part of the property purchased by the vendees did not give the appellants a right to preempt. He referred to the fact that exchange of lands was sometimes recognised as conferring on the party the right to preempt, but that was where the land exchanged did not form part of the land sold and preempted. In the result, the High Court held that the plea made by the appellants was not well founded in law and so, the respondents were entitled to pre empt. As a result of this finding, the decrees passed by the lower appellate Court were reversed and the respondents' suits were decreed. The appellants then moved the Division Bench by Letters Patent appeals, but these appeals were dismissed. It is against the decrees thus passed by the Division Bench in Letters Patent appeals that the appellants have come to this Court by special leave. We have already noticed that both the appellants and the respondents are claiming a right to preempt under section 15(c) (ii) and (iii) of the Parent Act of 1913. On February 4, 1960, the amending Act No. 10 of 1960 was passed. Section 4 of the amending Act has substituted a new s.15 of the old s.15 after making substantial changes in the provisions of the earlier section. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the original s.15(c) have been deleted, with the result that the claims for preemption made both by the appellants and the respondents have ceased to be recognised by the amended provisions. The appellants contend that since the respondents have got a decree for pre emption in their favour on the provisions of the unamended s.15, that decree can no longer be sustained because of the provisions of s.31 of the amending Act. Section 31 provides that no Court shall pass a decree in a suit for pre emption whether instituted before or after the commencement of the Punjab Pre emption (Amendment) Act, 1959(1960) which is inconsistent with the provisions of the said Act. In support of his argument that s.31 being retrospective in operation the respondents' title to claim pre emption can no longer be entertained. Mr. Achhru Ram for the appellants has invited our attention to a recent decision of this Court in the case of Ram Sarup vs Munshi (1) pronounced on August 30, 1962. In that case, Ayyangar, J., who spoke for the Constitution Bench considered the question about the retrospective operation of section 31 and has observed that the said provision is retrospective and that the language used in the said section is 'plain and comprehensive so as to require an appellate Court to give effect to the substantive provisions of the amending Act whether the appeal before it is one against a decree granting preemption or one refusing that relief,' It was no doubt urged before the Court in that case that the words used in section 31 did not justify the application of the amended provisions to proceedings pending before the appellate Court; them said words showed that the said provisions could be invoked only in cases which were pending before the trial Court. This contention was rejected and so, it must be taken to be settled that the provisions of section 31 are retrospective and can be relied upon by the appellants in their present appeals before this Court. This position would undoubtedly have helped the appellants but for another complication which has been introduced by the relevant provisions of the amended section 15 enacted by the amending Act. We have already noticed that some persons whose right to preempt was recognised by the corresponding provisions of the parent Act, have been omitted by the amended section. The amended section has also introduced another class of persons on whom the right to claim pre emption has been conferred. These persons are the tenants who hold under tenancy of the vendors the land or property sold or a part thereof. This class of tenants has been introduced in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of amended section 15. Clause four of section 15(1) (c) provides that the right of pre emption in respect of agricultural land and village immovable property shall vest in the tenants who hold under tenancy of the vendors or any one of them the land or property sold or a part thereof. Similar provisions are made in clauses (a) & (b) of the said section. For the respondents Mr. Vohra contends that they are the tenants who hold under tenancy of the vendor the lands in question and as such, they are now clothed with the right to claim pre emption. In other words, the respondents argument is that though the right to preempt which they possessed under clauses (ii) and (iii) of the unamended section 15(c) of the parent Act have been taken away retrospectively by the amending Act, they have been clothed with the same right by virtue of the fact that they fall under the fourth clause of the amended s, 15 (1) (c) and the conferment of this right like the destruction of their right under the deleted provisions of the unamended section must operate retrospectively. He, therefore, suggests that the respondents ought to be given an opportunity to prove their case under the fourth clause of section 15(c) as amended. In this connection, he has referred us to the fact that this plea has been specifically taken by the respondents in their statement of the case before this Court. It is on this plea that the question about the effect of the retrospective operation of section 31 arises. Mr. Achhru Ram contends that though section 31 is retrospective and in that sense the rights to preempt which vested in the respondents at the time when they instituted the present suits have been retrospectively taken away from them, it cannot be said that the right to preempt to which the respondents lay claim in the present appeals has been retrospectively created. His argument is that by the amending Act, the Legislature has no doubt provided that certain classes of persons who were entitled to preempt under the old Act should not be given that right and the extinction of the said right should operate retrospectively, but that cannot be said to be the policy of the legislature in regard to the rights which have been created for the first time by the amending Act. The argument thus presented may prima facie appear to be attractive; but a close examination of the words used in section 31 shows that it is not well founded. Section 31, in substance, requires the appellate Court to pass a decree in a preemption matter which is not inconsistent with the provisions of the amending Act. In the present appeals, if we were to uphold the respondents' right to claim preemption on the strength of the provisions of section 15(c) as they stood prior to the amendment, that would be inconsistent with the provisions of the amending Act, and so, the change made by the amending Act has to be given effect to and the right which once vested in the respondents must be deemed to have been retrospectively taken away from them. On this point there is no dispute. Would it make any difference in the legal position when we are dealing with rights which are created for the first time by the amending Act on the date when this Court will pass a decree in the present appeals? If the rights created in favour of the tenants are not recognised and a decree is passed ignoring the said rights, that decree would be inconsistent with the relevant provisions of the amending Act, and section 31 has clearly enjoined that no Court shall pass a decree which is inconsistent with the provisions of the amending Act. The position, therefore, appears to be clear that when a decree is passed in a preemption matter pending before the appellate Court, that Court must refuse to recognise the right to preempt which was recognised by the unamended Act but has been dropped by the amending Act just as much as it must recognise rights which were not recognised by the unamended Act but have been created by the amending Act. The retrospective operation of s.31 necessarily involves effect being given to the substantive provisions of section 15 retrospectively and that will apply as much to the extinction of the old rights as to the creation of new ones. The retrospective operation of section 15 which is consequential on the retrospective operation of s.31 is not affected by the fact that the right of preemption prescribed by section 15 is referred to as a right which shall vest in the persons specified in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of section 15(1). It is, however, urged that the law of preemption requires that the preemptor must possess the right to preempt at the date of the sale, at the date of the suit and at the date of the decree. This position cannot be disputed. But when it is suggested that the respondents cannot claim that they had the right when they brought the present suit or when the sales were effected, the argument ignores the true effect of the retrospective operation of section 31 and section 15. If the inevitable consequence of the retrospective operation of s.31 is to make the substantive provisions of section 15 also retrospective, it follows that by fiction introduced by the retrospective operation, the rights which the respondents claim under the amended provisions of section 15 must be deemed to have vested in them at the relevant time. If the relevant provisions are made retrospective by the legislature, the retrospective operation must be given full effect to, and that meets the argument that the right to preempt did not exist in the respondents at the time when the sale transactions in question took place. Therefore, we are satisfied that the respondents are entitled to claim that they should be given an opportunity to prove their case that as tenants of the lands in suit they have a right to claim preemption. Incidentally, when the respondents filed the present suits, they had a right to preempt under the relevant provisions of the Act as they stood at that time; by the amendment, that right has been taken away, but instead they claim another right by virtue of their status as tenants of the lands, and this right is, by the retrospective operation of section 31, available to them. We must accordingly set aside the decrees passed by the High Court and send the matters back to the trial Court with a direction that it should allow the respondents an opportunity to amend their claims by putting forth their right to ask for preemption as tenants under the amended provision of s. 15. After the amendments are thus made, the appellants should be given an opportunity to file their written statements and then appropriate issues should be framed and the suits tried and disposed of in the light of the findings on those issues in accordance with law. Under the unusual circumstances in which the litigation has thus secured a further lease of life, we direct that the costs incurred so far should be borne by the parties.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 5313 of 1983. Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 17th January, 1983 in CMWP. No. 8397 of 1982. Shanti Bhushan and section Markandeya for the Appellant. Gopal Subramaniam and Mrs. section Dikshit for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J. About 45 plots of land of Kheragarh village and about 15 adjoining plots of land of Nagala Udaiya village situated in the district of Agra were notified under section 4 (1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Act No. 1 of 1894) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act ') for acquisition for a public purpose, namely, for the construction of the Market Yard of the Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti, Kheragarh under a notification dated January 8, 1980 issued by the Government of the State of Uttar Pradesh. As the plots of land in question which were agricultural lands were urgently required for the aforesaid purpose and the Government was of the view that it was necessary to direct that section 5 A of the Act should not apply to the said acquisition proceedings, it simultaneously made an order under section 17 (4) of the Act directing that section 5 A would not apply to the said proceedings and incorporated the said order also in the notification issued under section 4 (1) of the Act. The notification was published in the Official Gazette dated January 9, 1980. This was followed by a notification dated January 9, 1980 under section 6 of the Act published in the Official Gazette dated January 10, 1980. That notification contained an order made under section 17 (1) of the Act authorising the Collector to take possession of the plots on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice under section 9 (1) of the Act though no award under section 11 of the Act had been made. The above said plots of land which were in all about 60 in number belonged to a number of persons. The total extent of land proposed to be acquired was about 41.46 acres. The possession of all the plots of land was also taken in the course of the said acquisition proceedings. In or about June 1982, notices were issued by the Collector to various persons having interest in the said plots under section 9 (3) of the Act for the purpose of determining the compensation payable to them. After the issue of the said notices, three persons Hari Singh (appellant No. 1), Pooran Chand (appellant No. 2) and Munna Lal (appellant No. 3) filed a writ petition in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 8397 of 1982 on the file of the High Court of Allahabad questioning the validity of the acquisition proceedings as regards 6 plots of land in Kheragarh village out of the total of about 60 plots of land which had been acquired by the State Government in the above said proceedings. Appellant No. 1 claimed to be the owner of plots Nos 249, 250 and 252. Appellant No 2 claimed to be the owner of plot No. 261 and appellant No 3 claimed to be the owner of plots Nos. 133 and 134. Appellant No. 1 pleaded that there was a house situated on plot No. 249 and that he had also installed a flour mill on it. They all pleaded that they had no knowledge of the acquisition proceedings and were prejudiced by the order made under section 17 (4) of the Act exempting the operation of section 5 A of the Act in the case of these proceedings. They further pleaded that there was no urgency sufficient in law to sustain the order made under section 17 (4) of the Act as nothing had been done on the lands for nearly two years. Appellant No. 1 also pleaded that section 17 (4) of the Act would not be applicable because on a part of his land there was a house. They also applied for an interim order restraining the Collector from dispossessing them from the plots in question. On September 9, 1982 the High Court made an interim order restraining the respondents from dispossessing the appellants from the plots until further orders, unless they had already been dispossessed. But on January 17, 1983, the High Court rejected the writ petition at the stage of admission after hearing the advocates for both the parties. This appeal by special leave is filed by the appellants under Article 136 of the Constitution on against the order of the High Court. The High Court has not given any reasons for its order dismissing the writ petition. The order reads: 'Rejected '. We have been taken through the writ petition, counter affidavits and other papers filed in the High Court and in this Court. At the out set we are of the view that the writ petition filed in July, 1982 questioning the notification issued in January, 1980 after a delay of nearly two and a half years is liable to be dismissed on the ground of laches only. It is no doubt true that the appellant have pleaded that they did not know anything about the notifications which had been published in the Gazette till they came to know of the notices issued under section 9 (3) of the Act but they have not pleaded that there was no publication in the locality of the public notice of the substance of the notification as required by section 4 (1) of the Act. It should be presumed that official acts would have been performed duly as required by law. It is significant that a large number of persons who own the remaining plots have not challenged the acquisition proceedings. The only other petition in which these proceedings are challenged is Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 11476 of 1982 on the file of the High Court filed subsequently by Amar Singh and four others. Moreover in a small place like Kheragarh where these plots are situate, the acquisition of these lands would be the talk of the town in a shortwhile and it is difficult to believe that the appellant who are residents of that place would not have known till July, 1982 that the impugned notification had been published in 1980. Any interference in this case filed after two and a half years with the acquisition proceedings is likely to cause serious public prejudice. This appeal should, therefore, fail on the ground of delay alone. Now even on merits there appears to be no substance in the case of the appellants. At the hearing of this appeal, the appellants have confined their case to plots Nos. 249, 261 and 133 and have given up their case in regard to plots Nos. 250, 252 and 134. Appellant No. 1 claims to be the owner of plot No. 249. On behalf of the respondents it is urged that appellant No. 1 is recorded only as a co tenure holder alongwith five others and they have not impeached the notifications. With regard to the allegation about the existence of a house on this plot, it is seen that the said fact is denied. The respondents rely upon some statements recorded by the revenue authorities suggesting that there was no house on this plot on the date of the notification. This is a disputed question of fact. Appellant No. 2 who claims to be the owner of plot No. 261 is stated to have purchased it on November 17, 1980 after the impugned notifications were published. The title of appellant No. 3 to plot No. 133 is denied by R. K Kannaujia, Secretary, Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti, Kheragarh. In this state of affairs where there are disputed questions of fact it cannot be said that the appellants have made out any case for interference under Article 226 of the Constitution. On behalf of the appellants reliance is, however, placed on a decision of this Court in State of Punjab vs Gurdial Singh & Ors.(I) In that decision the main point made out was that the acquisition proceedings had been engineered mala fide by a State Minister. We do not have any such allegation in the present case. In the circumstances of this case we do not find that there is any ground to hold that the order made under section 17 (4) of the Act exempting the operation of section 5 A of the Act is bad in law even though there appears to be some administrative delay in commencing the construction of the Market Yard. Some photographs of the land produced before us, however, show that the work of construction has already been commenced. We do not, therefore, find that there is any ground to interfere with the order of the High Court dismissing the writ petition. The appeal fails and it is dismissed with costs. H.S.K. Appeal dismissed.",

            "judgement": "Appeal No.84 of 1960. 888 Appeal from the judgment and decree dated July 26, 1956. of the Bombay, High Court in Appeal No. he 138 of 1956. The appellant in person. B. R. L. Ayengar and D. Gupta, for the respondent. April 12. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA, C. J. The main question for decision in this appeal, on a certificate of fitness granted by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, is whether a public servant, who has been officiating in a higher post but has been reverted to his substantive rank as a result of an adverse finding against him in a departmental enquiry for misconduct, can be said to have been reduced in rank within the meaning of section 240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935. The learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, by his, Judgment and Decree dated October 31, 1955, held that it was so. The High Court of Bombay, on a first appeal from that decision, by its Judgment and Decree dated July 26, 1956, has held to the contrary. In so far as it is necessary for the determination of this appeal, the facts of this case may shortly be stated as follows. The appellant was holding the rank of a Mamlatdar in the First Grade and was officiating as a District Deputy Collector. In the latter capacity he was functioning as a District Supplies Officer. He had to undertake tours in the discharge of his official duties for which he maintained a motor car. In respect of one of his travelling allowance bills, it was found that he had charged travelling allowance in respect of 59 miles whereas the correct distance was only 51 miles. A departmental enquiry was held against him as a result of which he was reverted to his original rank as Mamlatdar, by virtue of the Order of the Government dated August 11, 1948, (exhibit 35), which was to the following effect: 'After careful consideration Government have decided to revert you to Mamlatdar for a period of 889 three years and have further directed that you should refund the excess mileage drawn by you in respect of the three journeys.' The appellant made a number of representations to the Government challenging the correctness of the findings against him and praying for re consideration of the Order of Reversion passed against, him but to no effect, in spite of the fact that ultimately the Accountant General gave his opinion that the appellant had not overcharged and that there was no fraud involved in the travelling allowance bill which was the subject matter of the charge against him. But ultimately, by a Notification dated March 26, 1951, (exhibit 61), the appellant was promoted to the Selection Grade with effect from August 1, 1950, but even so the Order of Reversion passed against the appellant remained effective and appears to have affected his place in the Selection Grade. Eventually, the appellant retired from service on superannuation with effect from November 28, 1953. He filed his suit against the State of Bombay on August 2, 1954, for a declaration that the Order of the Government dated August 11, 1948, was void, inoperative, wrongful, illegal and ultra vires, and for recovery of Rs. 12,866 odd or account of his arrears of salary, allowances, etc. with interest and future interest. The learned Civil Judge Senior Division, at Belgaum, came to the conclusion that the first part of the departmental enquiry held against the plaintiff leading up to the findings against him was free from any defect but that he had no been given the opportunity of showing cause against the punishment proposed to be inflicted upon him as a result of those findings, in so far as no show cause notice was given to him nor a copy of the enquire, report showing the grounds on which the findings had been based. There was, thus, according to the finding of the Trial Court, no full compliance with the requirements of section 240(3) of the Government of India Act 1935. The Court also held that the Order of Reversion amounted to a penalty imposed upon the plaintiff as a result of the enquiry. The Court, therefore, came to the conclusion that the Order aforesaid passed by the Government reverting him to the substantive rank was void and granted him that declaration, but dismissed his suit, with costs, in respect of the arrears Claimed by him as aforesaid on the ground that it was based on tort and not on contract. There was an appeal by the plaintiff in respect of the dismissal of his claim for arrears, and cross objections by the State in respect of that part of the judgment and decree which had granted declaration in favour of the plaintiff. The High Court dismissed the appeal by the plaintiff and allowed the cross objections of the defendant respondent in respect of the declaration, but made no orders as to the costs of the appeal and the cross objections. The High Court held that the Order of Reversion, even assuming that it was a punishment as a result of the departmental enquiry against the appellant, was not a punishment within the meaning of section 240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935. It also held that the Order of Reversion was not a punishment at all. In this Court, the appellant, who has argued his own case with ability, has urged in the first place, and in our opinion rightly, that his case is covered by the observations of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India (1). Those observations are as follows: 'A reduction in rank likewise may be by way of punishment or it may be an innocuous thing. If the Government servant has a right to a particular rank, then the very reduction from that rank will operate as a penalty, for he will then lose the emoluments and privileges of that rank. If, however, he has no right to the particular rank, his reduction from an officiating higher rank to his substantive lower rank will not ordinarily be a punishment. But the mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the Government has, by contract, express or implied, or under the rules, the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant to a lower post or rank cannot in any circumstances be a punishment. The real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences. Thus if the order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion, then that circumstance may indicate that although in form the Government had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules, in truth and reality the Government has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty. The use of the expression 'terminate' or 'discharge' is not conclusive. In spite of the use of such innocuous expressions, the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above, namely, (1) whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or (2) whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to? If the case satisfies either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service or the reversion to his substantive rank must be regarded as a reduction in rank and if the requirements of rules and article 311, which give protection to Government servant have not been complied with, the termination of the service or the reduction in rank must be held to be wrongful and in violation of the constitutional right of the servant.' He has rightly pointed out that he would have continued as a Deputy Collector but for the Order of the Government, dated August 11, 1948, impugned in this case, as a result of the enquiry held against him, and that his reversion was not as a matter of course or for administrative convenience. The Order, in terms, held him back for three years. Thus his emoluments, present as well as future, were adversely affected by the 892 Order aforesaid of the Government. In the ordinary course, he would have continued as a District Deputy Collector with all the emoluments of the post and would have been entitled to further promotion but for the setback in his service as a result of the adverse finding against him, which finding was ultimately declared by the Accountant General to have been under a misapprehension of the true facts. It is true that he was promoted as a result of the Government Order dated March 26, 1951, with effect from August 1, 1950. But that promotion did not entirely cover the ground lost by him as a result of the Government Order impugned in this case. It is noteworthy that the Judgment of the High Court under appeal was given in July, 1956, when the decision of this Court in Dhingra's case (1) had not been given. The decision of this Court was given in November, 1957. Of the two tests laid down by this Court, certainly the second test applies, if not also the first one. He may or may not have a right to hold the post or the rank, but there is no doubt that he was visited with evil consequences. Ordinarily, if a public servant has been officiating in a higher rank it cannot be said that he has a substantive right to that higher rank. He may have to revert to his substantive rank as a result of the exigencies of the service or he may be reverted as a result of an adverse finding in an enquiry against him for misconduct. In every case of reversion from an officiating higher post to his substantive post, the civil servant concerned is deprived of the emoluments of the higher post. But that cannot, by itself, be a ground for holding that the second test in Dhingra's case (1), namely, whether he has been visited with evil consequences, can be said to have been satisfied. Hence, mere deprivation of higher emoluments as a consequence of a reversion cannot amount to the 'evil consequences' referred to in the second test in Dhingra's case (1); they must mean something more than mere deprivation of higher emoluments. That being so, they include, for example, forfeiture of substantive pay, loss of seniority, etc. Applying that test to the present case, it cannot be said that simply because the appellant did not get a Deputy Collector's salary for three years, he was visited with evil consequences of the type contemplated in Dhingra's case (1). Even if he had been reverted in the ordinary course of the exigencies of the service, the same consequences would have ensued. If the loss of the emoluments attaching to the higher rank in which he was officiating was the only consequence of his reversion as a result of the enquiry against him, the appellant would have no cause of action. But it is clear that as a result of the Order dated August 11, 1948 (exhibit 35), the appellant lost his seniority as a Mamlatdar, which was his substantive post: That being so, it was not a simple case of reversion with no evil consequences; it had such consequences as would come within the test of punishment as laid down in Dhingra's case. If the reversion had not been for a period of three years, it could not be said that the appellant had been punished within the meaning of the rule laid down in Dhingra's case, (1). It cannot be asserted that his reversion to a substantive post for a period of three years was not by way of punishment. From the facts of this case it is clear that the appellant was on the upward move in the cadre of his service and but for this aberration in his progress to a higher post, he would have, in ordinary course, been promoted as he actually was sometime later when the authorities realised perhaps that he had not been justly treated, as is clear from the Order of the Government, dated March 26, 1951, promoting him to the higher rank with effect from August 1, 1950. But that belated justice meted out to him by the Government did not completely undo the mischief of the Order of Reversion impugned in this case. It is clear to us, therefore, that as a result of the Order of Reversion aforesaid, the appellant had been punished and that the Order of the Government punishing him was not wholly regular. It has been found that the requirements of section 240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, corresponding to article 311 (2) of the Constitution, had not been fully complied with. His reversion in rank, therefore, was in violation of the Constitutional guarantee. In view of these considerations it must be held that the High Court was not right in holding against the appellant that his reversion was not a punishment contemplated by section 240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935. On this part of the case, in our opinion, the decision of the High Court has to be reversed and that of the Trial Court that his reversion to his substantive rank was void, must be restored. The question then arises whether he is entitled to any relief in respect of his claim for arrears of salary and dearness allowance. He has claimed Rs. 10,777 odd as arrears of pay, Rs. 951 odd as arrears of dearness allowance, as also Rs. 688 odd as arrears of daily allowance plus interest of Rs. 471 odd, thus aggregating to the sum of Rs. 12,886 odd. This claim is spread over the period August, 1946, to November, 1953, that is to say, until the date of his retirement from Government service, plus future interest also. On this part of the case the learned Trial Judge, relying upon the case of the High Commissioner for India and Pakistan vs I. M. Lall (1) held that a government servant has no right to recover arrears of pay by an action in a Civil Court. He got over the decision of this Court in the State of Bihar vs Abdul Majid (2) on the ground that that case has made a distinction between a claim based on a contract and that on a tort. In the instant case, he came to the conclusion that as the plaintiff had claimed the difference between the pay and allowance actually drawn and those to which he would have been entitled but for the wrongful orders, the claim was based on tort and, therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief. On the question of limitation, he held that the suit would be governed by article 102 of the Indian Limitation Act (IX of 1908) as laid down by the Federal Court in the case of The Punjab Province vs Pandit Tarachand (3). In that view of the matter, the learned Judge held that adding the period of two months of the statutory notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure given to Government, the claim would be in time from June 2, 1951. Hence the Trial Court, while giving the declaration that the Order impugned was void, dismissed, the rest of the claim with a direction that the plaintiff was to pay 3/4ths of the costs of the suit to the defendant. The High Court dismissed the suit in its entirety after allowing the cross objections of the State. The appellant contended that his suit for arrears of salary would not be governed by the three years rule laid down in article 102 of the Limitation Act and that the decision of the Federal Court in Tarachand's case (1) was not correct. The sole ground on which this contention was based was that 'salary' was not included within the term 'wages'. In our opinion, no good reasons have been adduced before us for not following the aforesaid decision of the Federal Court. In the result, the appeal is allowed in part, that is to say, the declaration granted by the Trial Court that the Order of the Government impugned in this case is void, is restored, in disagreement with the decision of the High Court. The claim as regards arrears of salary and allowance is allowed in part only from the 2nd of June, 1951, until the date of the plaintiff's retirement from Government service. There will be no decree for interest before the date of the suit, but the decretal sum shall bear interest at 6% per annum from the date of the suit until realisation. The plaintiff appellant will be entitled to three fourths of his costs throughout, in view of the fact that his entire claim is not being allowed. Appeal allowed in part.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 1044 of 1968. Appeal from the judgment and order dated October 3, 1967 of the Gujarat High Court in Special Civil Application No. 380 of 1965. section T. Desai, V. B. Patel and I. N. Shroff, for the appellant. section S Shukla, for respondents Nos. 1 to 9. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Dua, J. This appeal has been presented to this Court by the Ahmedabad Manufacturing & Calico Printing Co., Ltd., pursuant to the certificate granted by the Gujarat High Court under article 187 133(1)(c) of the Constitution. The Gujarat High Court had, on being approached by the respondents under article 227 of the Constitution, quashed and set aside the order of the Industrial Court, Gujarat dated February 5, 1964 which had affirmed the order of the Second Labour Court, Ahmedabad dated August 9, 1963, and after setting aside that order had directed the Industrial, Court to decide the matter afresh in the light of the observations made by the High Court in the impugned order. The respondents in this Court had applied to the Labour Court under section 79 of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, No. XI of 1947 (hereinafter called the Act) in December, 1962 complaining that the appellant company was liable to pay to the respondents (applicants before the Labour Court) dearness allowance every month according to the Dearness Allowance Award made by the Industrial Court but the same had not been paid for the month of September, 1962 which was distributed in October, 1962. It was alleged that from October, 1962 the Company had been committing breach of the Dearness Allowance Award of the Industrial Court. In that application the present respondents had based their claim on the following averments in para 3: '. the applicants are being paid Rs. 68 as basic pay by the opponent. The maintenance of the garden is the legal responsibility of the opponent and for the health, welfare, recreation of the employees working in the several departments and for the decency of the adjacent offices the opponents are maintaining it. The applicants are doing the entire work in respect thereof.' In the written statement the appellant company raised several pleas in opposing that application. The pleas which were pressed in the Second Labour Court and in the Industrial Court and which are now strongly pressed before us are contained in paras 3. 8 and 10 which so far as relevant may be reproduced: 3. That the applicants not being in the employment of the opponent they have no locus standi to make an approach or to file this application. That the opponent is not the employer of the applicants and the applicants are not its employees within the meanings of those words in the Act and as such the application is misconceived and not legally tenable. With respect to the allegations and averments made in paras 1 to 4 of the application it is denied that the applicants are the employees of the opponent within the meaning of that term of the Act as alleged or that 188 they are entitled to the benefits of the dearness allowance as alleged or otherwise. The true fact is that the applicants are not employed in any work which is ordinarily a part of the undertaking and as such they are not the employees within the definition of that word in the Act. The applicants are employed as coolies by a gardening contractor Messrs Dbiraj Painters and they are paid by the said contractor. The said garden lands include a large area of offices of some other concerns, a Government Post Office and a Museum which are open to the public, some quarters for workers as well as assistants and officers a hospital. It is for the garden of the area which comprises these buildings and the area round caustic plant factory as well as the field in Dani Limda that this agreement was entered into with the contractor for keeping the trees and plants in proper trim. Hence the work which they are performing has been held to be not ordinarily a part of the undertaking and as such the application is wholly misconceived and not legally tenable and is clearly barred by res judicata.' The Second Labour Court dismissed the respondent's applications. In that Court's view the real question in issue was whether the appellants did any work which is ordinary part of the undertaking. The plea of res judicata based on the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India, Bombay (Appeal No. 135 of 1954 reported in was negatived but it was observed that the principle laid down in the earlier case would govern the present case as well. After quoting the following passage from the earlier case 'Now the Industrial Court was correct in holding that the agreement applied to the area which was outside the factory proper. But to our mind the principle question involved is whether the maintenance of trees and plants can be said to be work which is ordinarily part of the undertaking. In another case, this Tribunal had decided that a ration shop was a part of the work which is ordinarily a part of the undertaking, but the maintenance of these trees and plants stands on a different footing and can hardly be regarded as part of the work of this particular undertaking which in fact is concerned with the production of cloth. We can see no intrinsic connection between the maintenance of the trees and plants and the work which is ordinary part of the undertaking.' the Labour Court observed that the 'applicants' gardeners or malis who are contractor's employees cannot thus invoke the statutory definition of the employer'. 189 On appeal by the aggrieved malis the Industrial Court in the course of its judgment observed that there was no dispute that the appellants in that court had been working as gardeners or garden mazdoors and had been employed through a contractor and not directly by the mill. After referring to the decision of this Court in J.K. Cotton Spg. & Wvg. Mills Co. Ltd., vs Labour Appellate Tribunal of India (1) and to the decision of the Madras High Court in Thyagaraja Chettiar vs Employees State Insurance Corporation( ' ') the, Industrial, Court observed : 'Shri Jyotikar had urged that the term 'mill premises ' as interpreted by the courts would include even Places around the factory and so the question whether the appellants were working in one compound or the other would not be material. But it is not necessary to consider this contention because looking to the nature of the work done by the appellants and to the fact that they were not directly employed by the employer but through a contractor, it has been held that they cannot be covered within the scope of section 3(13). Shri Jyotikar had also argued that under the Standing Orders, the term 'operative 'has been defined to include persons employed through contractor; but the Standing Orders would apply to a particular person only if he is an employee as defined under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act. The definition under the Standing Orders cannot; therefore. be of any help in considering whether a person is covered within the scope of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act or not. Shri Jyotikar had then urged that in view of the fact that matters concerning health, safety and welfare of the employees are included in Item 3 of Schedule III, maintenance of gardens would be an ordinary part of the work of the undertaking. It is true that maintenance of gardens may be a matter concerning health or welfare of the employees, but there is no, legal obligation to maintain such gardens. Had any such obligation been created under any provision of law, the position might have been as urged by Shri Jyotikar; but, as the facts stand at present, it is not mandatory on a management of a cotton textile undertaking to maintain any garden and hence the work of maintenance of a garden cannot be said to be a work which is a part of the ordinary work of a cotton textile mill. It is clear from the above that the appellants cannot be held to be employees as defined under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act and so the Labour Court was right in dismissing the application.' (1) [1964] 3 S.Ck. 24. (2) [1963] II L.L.J. 207. 190 The High Court, on being approached by the aggrieved malis under article 227 of the Constitution, went into the matter at considerable, length and after copiously quoting from the decision in the case of J. K. Cotton Spg. & Wvg. Mills case (supra) the High Court found it difficult to agree with the reasoning of the Industrial Court that the work of maintaining the garden was not a part of the ordinary work of a cotton textile mill. Earlier in the course of its judgment the High Court, after referring to the definitions of the term 'employee' in section 3(13) and of the word 'industry' in section 3(19) of the Act had observed : '. The definition of the term 'industry ' is thus wide enough to include a workman employed in any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of employees and it would not be correct to assume that simply because a workman happened to be engaged as a gardener, he would not fall within the definition of the term 'employee ' as given in the Bombay Industrial Relations Act. A garden when attached to a mill is an amenity that is provided to the workers employed in the mill and it is not necessary that an amenity should arise from a statutory requirement or obligation and it hardly makes any difference if the garden was provided for voluntarily or under a statutory obligation. The activities in an undertaking such as a textile mill are not confined purely to factory work of manufacturing textile fabric within the mill premises, but various other incidental and connected institutions such as hospital, a canteen, a playground and a garden might be maintained by the mill to provide amenities to its workers and these activities could be considered as the activities made in relation to and in the usual course of conducting the affairs of the mill. Not merely within the turning of the wheels of the machine which, no doubt, is directly responsible for the production of the article for which the plant of the particular industry was installed and not merely in utilising the power to move the machine to action, the field of activities of the undertaking is restricted and exhausted, but there are many more varieties though allied and complementary activities which are being carried on by the management and which help, though in an indirect manner, in creating a healthy atmosphere of well being and cooperation amongst the workers by providing essential facilities such as means for treating of their ailments, for general entertainment and care not only of the workers but of the children who are left unattended while their parents are engaged in their work in the factory. While, therefore, construing the words 'in the course of ' and 'ordinarily a part of the undertaking ' we must give them a meaning which is natural and consistent with the working of a factory as it exists in the present times and while doing so, our approach should not be theoretical and academic but pragmatic and practical. The activities that are usually conducted as a part of an undertaking by which not only workers participate in the actual running of the machinery but also activities which conduce to the smooth working of the plant as a whole must be considered to fall within the ambit of the definition. We are, therefore, unable to agree with the contention of Mr. Patel that the application of the Act must be restricted to only those workers who are directly engaged in the manufacture of textile fabric.' While commenting on the order of the Industrial Court where it is stated that the maintenance of gardens though a matter concerning health or welfare of the employees was not mandatory on the management of a cotton textile mill undertaking and hence the work of maintenance of a garden could not be said to be part of the ordinary work of such mill, the High Court observed that ' an activity undertaken as a part of the undertaking and in the course of its conduct may be undertaken voluntarily or as a result of a statutory duty or obligation but what is necessary is that the activity must reasonably be attributable to the undertaking in its, usual and ordinary course in the conduct of the business or undertaking, and if that be so then such an activity could be considered as the activity of a worker who would fall within the definition of employee within section 3(13) of the Act.' It was, however, contended in the High Court on behalf of the present appellant that the garden in which the present respondents had been working as gardeners was not situated within the premises of the mill and that the garden area included office of some other concerns, a Government post office and a museum which was open to the public and, some quarters for workers as well as assistance and officers of the hospital. The garden area, according to Mr. Patel who represented the present appellants in the High Court comprised of the buildings just mentioned and the area round the caustic plant factory as well as the field at Dami Limda in respect of which an agreement had been entered into with the contractor for keeping the trees and plants in proper trim. This contention having not been considered by the 192 Industrial Court the High Court, as already observed, sent the case back to the Industrial Court for a fresh decision in the light of the observations of the High Court. In this Court Shri Desai on behalf of appellants contended that the High Court, while exercising its jurisdiction under article 227 of the Constitution, was not empowered to reverse the findings of the Industrial Court and the Labour Court because under that Article it could not perform the functions of an appellate or a revisional court. On the merits also he contended that having regard to section 2(3) of the Act read with the notification dated May 30, 1939, the Act only applied to cotton spinning and cotton weaving department, mechanics shops, dyeing and bleaching and printing departments and offices of the appellant, and to no other activities of the appellant company. The counsel further contended that clauses (13) and 14(e) of section 3 of the Act have to be read together and when so read they could not take within their fold a person employed by an independent contractor because such a person could by no means be considered as an employee of the appellant company unless the work done by him can be described as 'ordinarily part of the textile undertaking'. While developing this point the learned counsel said that the word 'ordinarily' occurring in the context 'work which is ordinarily a part of the undertaking' in section 3 (14) (e) conveys the idea that the work should be in the line or in the regular or normal course of the textile undertaking or any part of it. The work, it was explained, should be such as, in the regular or normal course, is part and parcel of the textile undertaking and not merely having some sort of incidental connection with the same. The work of gardening, added the counsel, cannot be considered to have done in 'execution' of any 'work' which is 'ordinarily' part of the textile undertaking. Before considering these points it would not be out of place to mention that in the certificate of fitness granted by the High Court there is no indication about the precise point or points which induced the High Court to certify the case to be fit for appeal under cl.(c) of article 133(1). This clause though couched in general terms is intended to apply to special cases in which the question raised is of such great public or private importance as deserves appropriately to be authoritatively settled by this Court. This clause of course does not in terms say so but it has always been so construed. The question whether or not to certify a given case to be fit for appeal under this clause is a matter for the judicial discretion of the High Court. The word 'certify' used in this clause suggests that the High Court is expected to apply its mind before certifying the case to be fit for appeal. The mere grant of a certificate would, however, not preclude this Court from determining whether the conditions pre-requisite for the grant are satisfied. It is, therefore, always desirable and expedient for the High Court to give its reasons for granting the certificate. That would assist this Court better in appreciating if the conditions pre-requisite are satisfied. In the application for certificate in the present case a number of grounds were stated for securing it. We are unable to find from the certificate as to which ground was considered by the High Court to be important enough to justify the certificate. Now, in this case the respondents in fact questioned before us the competence of the High Court to grant the certificate of fitness but the objection raised by Shri Shukla was based only on the submission that Art 133 is inapplicable because the impugned order is not a final order. We may first deal with this preliminary objection. Article 227 of the Constitution no doubt does not confer on the High Court power similar to that of an ordinary court of appeal. The material part of this Article substantially reproduces the provisions of section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915 except that the power of superintendence has been extended by this Article to Tribunals as well. Section 107 according to preponderance of judicial opinion clothed the High Courts with a power of judicial superintendence apart from and independently of the provisions of the other laws conferring on them revisional jurisdiction The power under article 227 of the Constitution is intended to be used sparingly and only in appropriate cases, for the purpose of keeping the subordinate courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority and, not for correcting mere errors: see Narayan Singh vs Amar Nath (1). At this stage we consider it proper to refer to some of the judicial pronouncements by this Court with regard to the right of appeal under article 133 from interlocutory orders. In Tarapur & Co. vs M/s. V/O Tractors Export(2) it was observed that an order of the High Court in appeal which does not dispose of the suit but merely refuses to grant an interim injunction is not a final order within the meaning of article 133 even though as a result thereof the pending suit as framed may become infructuous requiring amendment of the plaint. On the other hand, an order dismissing a writ petition challenging industrial award which disposes of only one of the items of a charter of demands by the workmen, leaving the rest of the items to be adjudicated by a subsequent award was held in Asbestos Cement Ltd. vs Savarkar(3) to be a final order in a civil proceeding and, therefore, appealable under article 133. Under article 226 of the Constitution it may in this connection be pointed out the High Court does not hear an appeal or a revision: that court is moved to interfere after bringing before itself the record of a case decided by or pending before a court, a tribunal or an authority, within its jurisdiction. A decision in the exercise of this extraordinary jurisdiction which finally disposes of the proceedings is a final order, in an original proceeding. An appeal or a revision on the other hand is generally considered to be a continuation of the original suit or proceeding and in a case, where the High Court deals with an appeal or a revision, finality for the purpose of article 133 must attach to the whole of the matter so that after the decision of the High Court the matter is not a live one, (see Ramesh vs Ganda Lal(1) The impugned order before us was made by the Gujarat High Court on an application under article 227 of the Constitution, the prayer in that application being, to remove the record of the case of the High Court 'and after examining the same' (a) to quash the order and judgment of respondent No. 2 at Annexure 'B' and (b), to direct respondent No. 2 to dispose of the appeal of the petitioner according to law.' Now, in some, High Courts article 227 is utilised for the purpose of securing relief by way of writs or directions in the nature of writs more accurately contemplated by article 226 of the Constitution: (Ramesh vs Ganda Lal(1) and in some this Article is invoked for getting orders of tribunals revised just as section 115, C.P.C. is utilised for revision of orders of subordinate courts: (Surinder Nath vs Stephen (2) (P) Ltd. As such power under article 227 may also be exercised suo motu. In the present case article 227 appears to us to have been used in effect as a substitute for article 226 for seeking a direction in nature of a writ for quashing the orders of the subordinate tribunals. At least it appears that the proceeding before the High Court was so treated by all concerned. We should, however, not be understood to express our approval of the use of article 227 for seeking relief by way of writs or directions in the nature of writs for which purpose article 226 is expressly and in precise language designed. From that point of view if otherwise the High Court, while disposing of a petition under article 227, finally settles some points affecting the rights of the parties then to that extent the impugned order may be considered to operate as a final order just as an order made under article 226 would. As to whether the High Court has jurisdiction to make the impugned order while exercising its power under article 227 will depend on our conclusion when considering the merits of the case. Coming to the merits of the case we should like first to reproduce the notification dated May 30, 1939 and the definitions of the word 'employee' and 'employer' so far as relevant for our purpose as contained in the Act. The notification reads: 'BOMBAY CASTLE, 30th May, 1939 BOMBAY INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ACT, 1939 No. 2847/34 A. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (3) of Section 2 of the Bombay Industrial Disputes Act, 1938 (Bom. XXV of 1938), and in supersession of Government Notification in the Political and Service Department No. 2847/34 2 dated the 14th March, 1939, the Government of Bombay is pleased to direct that the provisions of the Act which have been extended to the Province of Bombay under Government Notification in the Political and Services Department No. 2847/34 1, dated the 14th March, 1939, shall apply to the cotton Textile Industry as specified below: (a) All concerns using power and employing twenty or more workers which are engaged in cotton spinning; (b) all concerns using power and employing twenty or more workers which are engaged in cotton weaving with or without an admixture of silk, rayon, artificial silk or one or more of these; (c) all mechanics shops attached to and (all dyeing bleaching and printing departments, whether situated within or outside the precincts, of and forming integral part of) the concerns falling under clause (a) or (b). (d) All the offices, whether situated within or outside the precincts of the concerns falling under clause (a) or (b).' 'Employee' and 'employer' so far as relevant for our purpose are defined as '3. In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context (13) 'employee' means any person employed to do any skilled or unskilled work for hire or reward in any industry, and includes (a) a person employed by a contractor to do any work for him in the execution of a contract with an employer within the meaning of sub clause (e) of clause (14); (14) 'employer' includes (e) where the owner of any undertaking in the course of or for the purpose of conducting the undertaking contracts with any person for the execution by or under the contractor of the whole or any part of any work which is ordinarily part of the undertaking, the owner of the undertaking.' Shri Desai on behalf of the appellant submitted that the respondents in this Court who were gardeners employed by a contractor cannot fall within the definition of the word employee as contained in section 14(e) of the Act. He further contended that the notification issued under the Act extending its applicability to the textile undertaking does not take within its fold the respondents who are not directly connected with any part of the activity with which the appellant textile industry is directly concerned. In support of his contention he relied on some decided cases. The first decision to which our attention was drawn is reported as Kesar Lal Narsing Bhai vs M/s. Calico Printing Ltd.(1). This is a decision by the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India, Bombay and the present appellant was a respondent in that case. There, the gardeners who used to work outside the gate of the factory and had been employed through a contractor had applied under section 78(1)(A)(c) of the Act for a declaration from the first Labour Court that the mill's failure to pay wages and Dearness Allowance in accordance with the Standardisation Award amounted to an illegal change. The Labour Court had granted their application but the Industrial Court on appeal had reversed that decision. The employees took the matter on further appeal to the Appellate Tribunal but without success. In that case the employees had wrongly asserted in their applications that they were direct employees of the mills in question and the relief claimed was based on this erroneous assertion. The Standardisation Award by which the company was bound, it is pertinent to point out, was given only in respect of those persons who had been employed directly for the purpose of looking after the garden of, the factory proper. it would thus be obvious that the employees' claim there was liable to fail on the short ground that they were not direct employees as wrongly claimed by them and that the relief under the award was confined to direct employees only. But this apart, it is further clear from the decision of the Appellate Tribunal that under the agreement with the contractor there the latter had been employed for the purpose of looking after the garden not within the factory compound proper but beyond it. Indeed, the contractor's obligation to look after the garden extended further beyond even that area. It is in this context and background that the Appellate Tribunal observed in the concluding part of its order that 'statutory definition of an employee in our opinion cannot be invoked by a gardener who has been employed through a contractor for the work as undertaken here.' (emphasis supplied). This decision, therefore, does not assist us on the precise question raised. The next decision relied upon by Mr. Desai is reported as Hakim Singh vs J. C. Mills Ltd.(1). In that case the mills had employed a contractor to supply packing material. The contractor because of the nature of his work was given a room in the mills premises for preparing a particular packing material. An employee of the contractor applied to the Industrial Court for relief under the provisions of the Act. It was held that he could not be deemed to be an employee of the mills because the work which was carried on by the employer of the petitioner was not a part of the industrial undertaking. While commenting on the scope of section 3(13)(a) and section 14(e) of the Act which define the words 'employee' and 'employer', it was said that for the purpose of these provisions, there must be an industrial undertaking owned by somebody; some work, which is ordinary part of the undertaking must have been entrusted by the owner to the contractor: that contractor must be employed an employee; that employee can then by the combined operation of these provisions insist upon being treated as employee of the owner himself, the obvious idea behind this scheme being that the owner of an industrial undertaking should not be allowed to evade responsibilities towards his employees which are imposed by the labour laws, by entrusting a part or whole of the undertaking to a contractor. The actual decision of this case is on different facts and is clearly not of much help though the observations regarding the purpose of the provisions of the definitions admit of no controversy. Reliance was further placed by Shri Desai on the decision of this Court in Messrs Godavari Sugar Mills Ltd. vs D. K. Worlikar(2) where a notification applicable to the manufacture of sugar and its by-products was held not to cover the head office of the sugar mills at Bombay and the employees engaged there, when the head office was separated from the factories by, hundreds of miles. The notification was held not to cover sugar industry as such. Shri Desai also sought support from Begibhai M. Chokshi vs Ahmedabad Manufacturing & Calico Printing Co. Ltd.(3) (a decision of the Industrial Court, Bombay) which dealt with running of a retail shop; New India Tannis vs Aurora Singh Moibi(4) a case of doing repairs to the machinery of the factory and from M. Ghose vs National Street & Metal Works Ltd.(5) a case of an employee of a contractor engaged to paint the premises. Both the Calcutta decisions are under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The respondents' learned counsel, apart from urging that the High Court has sent the case back for deciding the nature of work done by the malis in this case and that, therefore, the appellant cannot appropriately ask this Court to determine these questions which are awaiting decision by the Industrial Court, also relied on Basti Sugar Mills Ltd. vs Ramjagar(1) and on J. K. Cotton Spg. & Wvg. Mills (supra). In the former case the respondents there employed by a contractor to remove press mud from the sugar factory were held to be workmen employed by the factory because removing press mud was considered ordinarily to be a part of the sugar industry. The latter case is an authority for the proposition that an employee engaged in any work or operation which is incidentally connected with the main industry is a workman if other requirements of section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 14 of 1947, are satisfied and that the malis in that case were workers within the meaning of section 2 of U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 28 of 1947. The bungalows and gardens on which the malis in that case worked were a kind of amenity supplied by the mills to its officers and on this reasoning the malis were held to be engaged in operations incidentally connected with the main industry carried on by the employer. It was by relying on the ratio of this decision that the High Court in the present case came to the conclusion that the workers in order to come within the definition of 'employee' need not necessarily be directly connected with the manufacture of textile fabrics. This decision is binding on us and indeed Shri Desai also fairly accepted its ratio. He only contended that the malis employed by a contractor unless directly connected with the textile operations cannot get the benefit of this decision. In our view on the conclusions of the High Court which have not been shown to be erroneous justifying interference it is not possible to reverse its decision on the basis of the abstract submission advanced by Shri Desai. As observed in J. K. Cotton Spg. & Wvg. Mills case (supra) the problem has to be looked at from the considerations of social justice which has become an integral part of our industrial law. This concept of social justice has a comprehensive sweep and it is neither pedantic nor one-sided but, is founded on socio-economic equality. It demands a realistic and pragmatic approach for resolving the controversy between capital and labour by weighing it on an even scale with the consciousness that industrial operations in modern times have become complex and complicated and for the efficient and successful functioning of an industry various amenities for those working in it are deemed as essential for a peaceful and healthy atmosphere. The High Court has left open for the decision by the Industrial Court the question as to the nature of the work done by the respondents for determining whether or not, in view of the fact that they are employed through a contractor and not directly, their case falls within section 3(13). This is what the High Court has said 'It was urged by Mr. Patel that the garden in which the petitioners were working as gardeners was not situated within the premises of the mill and that the garden area included a large area of offices of other concerns, a Government Post Office and Museum which were open to public and some quarters for workers as well as assistants and officers of a hospital. It was also urged by Mr. Patel that the garden area comprised of the above buildings and the area round the caustic plant factory as well as the field at Dani Limda in respect of which an agreement was entered into with the contractor for keeping the trees and plants in proper trim. It appears that this contention made on behalf of the mills was not considered by the Industrial Court as it appears from para 7 of the order of the Industrial Court because according to the Industrial Court, looking to the nature of the work done by the petitioners and to the fact that they were not directly employed by the employer but through a contractor, they could not be covered within the scope of section 3(13) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act. Since this contention has not been considered by the Industrial Court, we do not wish to express any opinion as regards the merits of this contention and it would be open to Respondent No. 1 to raise the contention before the Industrial Court which will decide on the merits of the contention if raised. Subject to this, the order of the Second Labour Court Ahmedabad dated 9th August, 1963 passed in Application No. 2005 of 1962 and the order of the Industrial Court, Ahmedabad dated 5th February, 1964 passed in Appeal (I.C) No. 123 of 1963 must be quashed and set aside and we direct that the matter should now be decided by the Industrial Court in the light of the observations made above.' There is no cogent ground why this matter should be decided by this Court and not by the Industrial Court in the normal course as directed by the High Court. In our opinion the order of the High Court is legally correct and is also eminently just and fair. We are unable, therefore, to agree with Mr. Desai that this order requires any interference. The principle followed by the High Court is the one which was laid down by this Court in J. K. Cotton Spg. & Wvg. Mills case (supra). The decisions of the Labour Court and the Industrial Court were based on misconception of the legal position and the High Court was within its authority to interfere under article 227 of the Constitution to quash them. The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs. G.C. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 212/55. Appeal from the Judgment and Decree dated July 7, 1953, of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal from Original Order No. 157 of 1952, arising out of the Judgment and Decree dated March 28, 1952, of the said High Court in Civil Rule No. 1409 of 1951. B. Sen and P. K. Bose for the appellants. P. K. Ghosh for the respondent. C. Mazumdar for the Intervener (Gopalpur Land Development Society, Ltd.). August 29. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA C. J. The only substantial question that arises for determination in this appeal, on a certificate granted by the Calcutta High Court under article 133 (1)(c) of the Constitution, is whether the Government of West Bengal was bound to frame a development scheme under the provisions of the West Bengal Land Development and Planning Act, 21 of 1948, which hereinafter will be referred to as the Act, when it exercised its power of emergency under section 7 of the Act. The facts of this case lie within a very narrow compass and are as follows: The respondent was the owner of about 18 bighas of land in a certain village in the district of 24 Parganas. By a notification dated January 6, 1950, and published in the Calcutta Gazette dated January 12, 1950, under section 4 of the Act, the Government declared that the cadastral survey 370 plots, particulars whereof were given in the notification, were likely to be needed for the settlement of immigrants and for creation of better living conditions in the locality. Thereafter a notification was issued under section 6 read with section 7 of the Act and published in the Calcutta Gazette dated April 27, 1950, declaring that the plots covered by the notification under section 4 aforesaid were needed for the very same purposes as stated in the notification under section 4. On or about December 16, 1950, possession of those plots, except three, was taken by the Government. When the Government started to erect certain structures on the land thus acquired and stored building materials near about, the respondent moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution challenging the vires of the Act and impugning the legality of the proceedings taken under the Act. The matter was heard by H. K. Bose, J., sitting singly. Before him the grounds urged in support of the petition were that the release of the three plots from the acquisition proceedings rendered the entire proceedings bad in law; that there was no urgency for the Government to take steps under section 7 of the Act, and for issuing the notification under section 6; and that the provisions of the Act infringed the fundamental rights of the respondent, petitioner in the High Court, enshrined in article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. The learned Judge, by his judgment dated March 28, 1952, negatived all those contentions and discharged the rule issued by the High Court on the Government of West Bengal and others under article 226 of the Constitution. The respondent preferred an appeal under the Letters Patent. The appeal was heard by a Division Bench consisting of G. N. Das and Debabrata Mookerjee, JJ. By their judgment dated July 7, 1953, it was held that the Act did not infringe the provisions of article 31 (2) of the Constitution and that therefore it became unnecessary to express any opinion with respect to the provisions of article 19(1)(f). But the Bench also examined the provisions of the Act in the light of article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution and came to the conclusion that there was no infirmity in the Act, even on that score. Having decided all the points raised on behalf of the appellant before it, the High Court allowed the appellant to raise another controversy, which had not been raised before the learned single Judge, namely, whether it was incumbent on the Government to frame a development scheme, after possession had been taken by it, of the land in question. Ordinarily, such a controversy should not have been allowed to be raised for the first time in the court of appeal. Be that as it may, it came to the conclusion that even though the Government was entitled to deal with the land on an emergency basis under section 7 of the Act, it was incumbent on the State Government to frame a development scheme after possession had been taken. The main reason for this conclusion as given by the High Court is that though section 7 had armed the Government with the power to take possession of the property before framing a scheme of development, the section does not, in terms, dispense with the necessity of framing a development scheme, after the emergency had been declared and possession taken. In that view of the matter, the court of appeal allowed the appeal in part and directed a writ of mandamus to issue to the respondents before it, requiring them to proceed to frame a development scheme in terms of the Act. The State of West Bengal and other officials who had been impleaded as respondents in the High Court applied for leave to appeal to this Court from the said judgment of the appeal court. The High Court granted the leave prayed for, on condition that the appellants paid for the representation of the respondent before this Court by a junior Advocate of this Court. That is how the matter comes before this Court. It was argued on behalf of the appellants that the appeal court had misapprehended the scope and effect of sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act; that the Act contemplated two categories of acquisition proceedings, namely, (1) acquisition under section 6, after compliance with the provisions of section 5 and (2) acquisition in case of an emergency under section 7 read with section 6 of the Act; that the condition precedent laid down in section 5 necessitating the framing of a scheme before a declaration under section 6 of the Act was made, is specifically excluded in cases of emergency once a declaration of emergency under section 7 is made. The High Court was, therefore, in error in insisting upon the framing of a development scheme under section 5 of the Act, when that section had not been made applicable to the case of an emergency acquisition. Once the property has been acquired it vests in the Government and thereafter the original holder of the property has no say in the matter, except on the question of amount of compensation. Mr. Sen, for the appellants, finally contended that if the High Court was right in insisting upon a scheme of development being framed, the whole purpose of declaring an emergency would be defeated. The learned counsel for the respondent has not made any serious attempt to meet the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants, but has attempted to show that the provisions of the Act, in so far as they give special powers to Government to declare an emergency and then to proceed with the acquisition without the necessity of framing a scheme of development, were unconstitutional, both in view of the provisions of article 31(2) and article 19(1)(f). He also made a very feeble attempt to rely upon the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution and to suggest that the respondent was being discriminated against in the application of the emergency provisions of the Act to his case. In our opinion, the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants are manifestly well founded and the High Court was clearly in error in issuing the mandamus against the appellants. Before dealing with the contentions raised on behalf of the parties, it is convenient, at this stage, to set out the relevant provisions of the Act. The Act replaced the West Bengal Land Development and Planning Ordinance, 11 of 1948, which was in similar terms. The Act and the Ordinance, which it replaced, were enacted apparently as a result of the emergency created by the continual exodus of Hindus from East Pakistan on a mass scale and the consequent immigration of a very large population into West Bengal as a result of the partition. The Act was enacted 'to provide for the acquisition and development of land for public purposes'. It adopts the definitions of 'land', 'Collector' and 'company' as in the Land Acquisition Act, 1 of 1894, to which it is, in its terms, supplementary. In the definition section 2, 'development scheme' means, a scheme for the development of land for any public purpose; and a 'notified area' has been defined as an area declared as such under sub section (1) of section 4. 'Public purpose' has been defined in cl. (d) of section 2 as including (i) the settlement of immigrants who have migrated into the State of West Bengal on account of circumstances beyond their control, (ii) the establishment of towns, model villages and agricultural colonies, (iii) the creation of better living conditions in urban and rural areas, and (iv) the improvement and development of agriculture, forestry, fisheries and industries; but does not include a purpose of the Union. Section 3 authorises the State Government to appoint the 'prescribed authority' for carrying out the purposes of the Act. Section 4 is, in terms, analogous to section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act and authorises the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette to declare any area to be a notified area on being satisfied that that specified area is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose. The Act was amended in 1955 by the West Bengal Act, XXIII of 1955, and one of the amendments made by that Act was to add section 4A making provision for objections to be taken by any person interested in any land within the notified area, for an opportunity of being heard and for an enquiry being made on the merits of such objections, and finally for submission to the State Government of a report on the objections raised. We are not concerned in this case with section 4A, because it was inserted into the Act after the decision of the case by the High Court. Section 5, with which we are mainly concerned in this case is in these terms: '5(1). The State Government may direct the prescribed authority, or, if it so thinks fit in any case, authorise any Company or local authority, to prepare, in accordance with the rules, a development scheme in respect of any notified area and thereupon such scheme shall be prepared accordingly and submitted, together with such particulars as may be prescribed by the rules, to the State Government for its sanction: Provided that no scheme shall be necessary for acquisition of land for the public purpose specified in sub clause (i) of clause (d) of section 2. A development scheme submitted to the State Government under subsection (1) may, after taking into consideration any report submitted under sub. section (2) of section 4A, be sanctioned by it either without any modification or subject to such modifications as it may deem fit.' The proviso to s. 5 was added by the same amending Act (West Bengal Act XXIII of 1955) and is likewise inapplicable to this case. Section 6 again is, in terms, analogous to section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, which provides for the declaration to be published in the Official Gazette to the effect that the State Government was satisfied that any land in a notified area, for which a development scheme has been sanctioned under section 5(2) of the Act, is needed for the purpose of executing such a scheme, unless there already has been a declaration made under section 7 of the Act. Section 7, which is another section, the construction of which is involved in this case, is in these terms: 'In cases of urgency, if in respect of any notified area the State Government is satisfied that the preparation of a development scheme is likely to be delayed, the State Government may, at any time, make a declaration under section 6, in respect of such notified area or any part thereof though no development scheme has either been prepared or sanctioned under section 5.' Section 8 makes the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act applicable to acquisition proceedings taken in pursuance of the declaration made, either under section 6 or section 7 of the Act, subject to certain reservations made in pursuance of the provisos to section 8, relating to taking possession, determination of the amount of compensation, and of market value. The other sections of the Act are not relevant to the point in controversy in this case and, therefore, need not be adverted to. It will be noticed that section 7 is in the nature of a proviso to section 6. Section 7 provides that in cases of urgency, if the State Government is satisfied that the preparation of a development scheme is likely to be delayed, it may make a declaration under section 6 that the land was needed for a public purpose, even though no development scheme has either been prepared or sanctioned under section 5. The section, therefore, in clear terms, authorises the State Government to issue the necessary declaration under section 6, which puts the machinery of land acquisition proceedings into motion, if it is satisfied that the public purpose necessitating the acquisition of the land in question would be subserved without the preparation of a development scheme. The Act itself came into existence in circumstances of great urgency. Naturally, therefore, in suitable cases, where the preparation of a development scheme would cause delay, the Government was authorised to proceed with the acquisition of land after making the necessary declaration under section 6. As already indicated after that declaration has been made by Government in the Official Gazette and the necessary enquiry made about compensation and the making of the award, the property becomes vested in the Government. The question naturally arises whether there is anything in the Act which makes it obligatory on the State Government to prepare a scheme of development thereafter. The High Court has recognised the need for taking speedy action to meet the emergency created by the heavy influx of immigrants. The High Court has observed that section 7 does not, in terms, dispense with the framing of a development scheme and that it merely says that the Government may issue a declaration under section 6, even though no development scheme has been framed. But the High Court has further observed that even after taking possession of the property under r. 8, framed under the Act, within three days, there is no reason why the normal process envisaged in the Act should not be gone through. The argument proceeds further that the Act itself contemplated land planning and development and therefore the framing of a development scheme was an essential part of the process. Hence, in the view of the High Court the framing of a development scheme was necessary in the normal course before the declaration under section 6 is made by the Government, and in the case of urgency under section 7, after taking possession of the land in question. In our opinion, such a construction of the provisions of the Act is not warranted by the terms of the Act. The addition of the proviso to section 5, quoted above, makes it clear that the Legislature has recognised the necessity in special circumstances of not framing a scheme in the case of the public purpose contemplated in cl. (d)(i) of section 2, namely, for the purpose of settlement of immigrants. On a fair reading of the relevant provisions of the Statute, it becomes clear that the Act contemplated acquisitions of two distinct classes, namely, (1) where the Government had first considered and sanctioned a development scheme under the provisions of section 5 and then made a declaration that the land in a notified area was needed for the purpose of executing the particular development scheme and (2) where the notification under section 6 is made without any development scheme being prepared and sanctioned under section 5. Once the declaration is made under section 6, the machinery of the Land Acquisition Act, 1 of 1894, comes into operation, of course subject to the reservations contained in the provisos to section 8, as aforesaid. The Land Acquisition Act itself does not contemplate the preparation of any such scheme of development. In other words, section 7 completely dispenses with the statutory necessity of preparing a scheme of development as envisaged in section 5 of the Act in cases where the Government has taken the decision that it is necessary to proceed further with the acquisition proceedings without waiting for the preparation of a scheme. To insist upon the preparation of a development scheme would amount to rendering the provisions of section 7 otiose. There is no justification for the observation made by the High Court that the Legislature did not intend that the State Government should proceed with the land acquisition proceedings under the Act without framing a scheme of development. The High Court has recognised the legal position that it is open to the Government to take possession of the land under acquisition within three days after the making of the declaration of urgency under section 7, but has insisted that, even after taking possession as a measure of urgency, the Government was bound to prepare a scheme of development. If that were so, the question naturally arises: to what use the land so taken possession of was to be put. The taking of possession in cases of urgency would itself predicate the use of the land thus taken possession of by the Government. But if the Government were to wait for the preparation and sanction of the scheme before putting the land acquired to any use, the very purpose of declaring the urgency and the taking of possession would be defeated. It is clear, therefore, that the Legislature did not mean to insist upon the preparation of a scheme of development in cases of land acquisition brought within the purview of section 7 of the Act. That disposes of the appeal. But the learned counsel for the respondent appealed to the provisions of articles 14, 19(1)(f) and 31(2) of the Constitution in aid of his contention that section 7 of the Act was ultra vires. Apparently, there is no discrimination. As already indicated, there are two classes of cases into which the land acquisition proceedings envisaged by the Act fall. The two classes can be easily identified and the purpose of the classification is based on a rational consideration, having due regard to the purpose and policy underlying the Act, namely, to acquire land for the public purpose, inter alia, of resettling immigrants who had to leave their hearth and home on account of circumstances beyond their control. Such cases of urgency, as come under section 7, are clearly meant to serve the main purpose of the Act. In our opinion, therefore, there is no substance in the contention that discrimination is implicit in the provisions of section 7. The attack on the Act based on articles 19(1)(f) and 31(2) of the Constitution is futile in view of the provisions of article 31B, which is in these terms: 'Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article 31A, none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground that such Act, Regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provisions of this Part, and notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary, each of the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of any competent Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force.' The Act in question is the last entry (serial number 20) in the Ninth Schedule. Article 31B, quoted above, which renders the Act immune from all attacks based on the provisions of Part III of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights, makes it unnecessary to discuss with reference to the provisions of the statute that, even if the question were open, the Act does not suffer from any such infirmity, as is attributed to it. In view of the considerations set out above, we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment under appeal with costs here and in the High Court. The respondent's petition questioning the vires of the Act is dismissed. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "N: Criminal Appeal Nos. 208 209 of 1974. Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 18/19 1 1974 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Revision Application Nos. 821/72 and 305/74. AND SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.) No 630 OF 1977. From the Judgment and order dated 30 6 1972 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Crl. Rev. No. 81/72. R. K. Garg, B. A. Desai. V. J. Francis, and D. K. Garg for the Appellant in Crl. A. Nos. 208 209. section K. Gambhir and Miss Ram Rikhyani for the Petitioner in SLP No. 630/77. J. L. Nain and M. N. Shroff for the Respondent in Crl. Nos. 208 209. 179 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA, J. These appeals by special leave directed against judgments dated January 17, 1974 and March 29, 1974, of the Bombay High Court, raise, among others, three important questions, namely: (1) Whether an officer of the Railway Protection Force, making an inquiry under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as the 1966 Act, in respect of an offence under Section 3 of that Act of unlawful possession of the railway property, is a Police officer for the purposes of Section 25, Evidence Act and Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 1898; and as such. any confession or incriminating statement recorded by him in the course of an inquiry under Section 9 of the Act is inadmissible in evidence. (2) Whether a person arrested by an officer of the Railway Protection Force under Section 6 of the Act for the alleged commission of an offence under Section 3 of the Act, is a \"person accused of an offence\" within the meaning of Article 20(3) of the Constitution. (3) Whether Section 9 of the Act is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. E The appeals arise in these circumstances: The Inspector, Central Intelligence Bureau, Head Quarters, Bombay (Shri P. A. Kakade) filed a complaint before the Presidency Magistrate, 35th Court, Victoria Terminus, Bombay, complaining of the commission of an offence by the appellants, herein, (in Crl. Appeals 208 and 209 of 1974), under Section 3 of the Act. The allegations in the complaint, as summarised in the judgment of the High Court in Criminal Revision Application No. 821 of 1973, are as under: On November 21, 1970, the Assistant Security officer, Central Railway, Bhusawal intimated to the Chief Security officer, Bombay V.T. that two wagons Nos. ERKC 9447 exhibit HSPG BNDN to Akola and Wagon No. ERKC 75531 exhibit were unloaded by Unloading Foreman, one B. D. Raverkar of Akola Goods Shed. Seventynine M. section Plates (Mild Steel Plates) were unloaded from Wagon No. ERKC 75531. On November 14, 1970, one Ram Singh who was having R. R. No. 982859 Invoice No. 3 for 78 M.S. Plates and Invoice No. 2 RR No. 892857 for 60 M.S. Plates signed the RRs. and endorsed the same to M/s. Vallabhaji Brothers, Clearing Agents at Akola Goods Shed for 180 taking the delivery. Clerk Onkar of the said firm was sent to take delivery. He took delivery of 78 plates from one J. Meshram after paying the necessary railway dues of Rs. 1,813.80 P., and the 78 Plates were removed by the said party in lorries. The Delivery of the second consignment of 60 M.S. Plates was taken on November 16, 1970 after paying the railway dues of Rs. 2.247.40 P. The said Ram Singh posed as a proprietor of Modern Industries which was found to be a fictitious firm, which never existed. The Deputy Commercial Superintendent, Bhusawal, on November 19, 1970, informed all concerned that the delivery from these wagons was obtained on fraudulent Railway Receipts. The inquiry into this case was entrusted to the Complainant Inspector, P. A. Kakade, who is an officer of the Railway Protection Force. In the course of that inquiry, the statements of certain persons, including that of Balkishan, appellant herein, were recorded by the said Inspector. On January 31, 1971, while inquiring into another case of Wadi Bunder in which Balkishan was involved, the Inspector recorded the confessional statement of Balkishan, appellant, herein. After making that confessional statement, Balkishan is said to have led Inspector Kakade, in the presence of Panchas, to Tulsiram Gupta Mills Estate Compound, wherefrom 35 M.S. Plates were recovered. The Inspector further discovered that the M.S. Plates were shifted from Devi Dayal 's compound to Nittal Estate, Kurla Andheri Road, Marol Naka and they were transported from there for Devi Dayal 's Estates. He recorded the statement of Tukaram, the owner of one of these motor trucks on February 7, 1971. Tukaram stated that his lorry was engaged on November 1, 1971, by the appellant. In the meantime, investigation regarding the offences of forgery and cheating was being done at Akola by the concerned Police Sub Inspector, who was directed to suspend his inquiry till further orders were received by him. In the complaint, Inspector Kakade stated that accused 2 and 3 are absconding Annexed to the complaint was a list of prosecution witnesses numbering, in all, 40 and a list of documents numbering 62. The appellant (accused 1) appeared before the Presidency Magistrate. He was then supplied the list of prosecution witnesses and the list of documents to be relied upon by the prosecution. The list of documents included the list of statements of various persons recorded by the Inspector of the Railway Protection Force. The Presidency Magistrate commenced an inquiry and recorded the 181 statements of four witnesses, of one on March 2, 1973 and of the other three on June 12, 1973. On June 11, 1973, an application was filed by the appellant to the Magistrate, making a grievance that although three witnesses had been examined, no copies of the documents were furnished to him by the prosecution. On June 25, 1973, the appellant made a further application to the Magistrate, requesting for supply of true copies of all the documents in the case to enable him to prepare his defence. He further prayed that he should be allowed to take photostats of all the documents in the presence of the court officer. The Magistrate on August 3, 1973, passed an order rejecting the accused 's application, dated June 11, 1973, on the ground that the offence complained of against him was non cognizable and the provisions of Section 251A of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not applicable, and consequently. he (accused 1) had no right to obtain copies of the documents concerned. The Magistrate further passed an order on August 3, 1973. declining to allow the accused to take photostats of all the documents, on the ground that the documents could not be allowed to be taken outside the court. He, however, added that \"if any request to secure the photostat copies in the Court comes, it will be considered\". On August 24, 1973, the Magistrate framed a charge under Section 3(a) of the Act to the effect? that on or after November 14, 1970 the accused was found in possession of M.S. Plates numbering about 110, which were the Railway property unlawfully possessed by him. The accused pleaded 'not guilty ' and again made an application repeating his request for copies of the statements of witnesses recorded by Inspector Kakade. He also prayed that he be allowed to inspect all the statements recorded by the prosecution and take copies thereof. The Magistrate rejected this application, also, by an order on September 7, 1973. Feeling aggrieved by the orders passed by the Magistrate on August 9. 1973 and September 7, 1973, and the framing of the charge against him, the appellant invoked the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court by a petition under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, and prayed that the said orders be quashed. In this petition, he challenged the constitutional validity of Section 9 of the Act. The petition was heard by a Bench consisting of Vaidya and Gandhi, JJ. The learned Judges answered all the questions, posed above, in the negative. But, on the other aspects of the case, the Assistant Government Pleader, appearing on behalf of the State, stated before the High Court that the prosecution did not desire to keep back 182 any material from the accused and that they would produce copies of statements of all the witnesses and the documents on which the prosecution intends to rely or which the accused wanted to examine. In view of this statement of the Government Pleader, the High Court set aside the orders of the Magistrate and directed the complainant under Section 165 of the Evidence Act to produce in the trial court the true copies of the statement of the witnesses already examined and to be examined hereafter By the complainant and of the documents on which the complainant desired to depend. The High Court further declared that the accused and his counsel shall be entitled to inspect those documents and take copies thereof, if necessary, in the court. If further declared that Section 9 of the Act, is not ultra vires the Constitution. Hence, these appeals by the accused persons. Question No. 1 The first question for consideration is. whether an Inspector of the Railway Protection Force, (for short, RPF) is a \"police officer\", and therefore any confessional statement made to him comes within the prohibition of Section 25. Evidence Act. Section 25 reads thus: \"No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.\" As explained by this Court in Ariel vs State the policy behind Sections 25 and 26. Evidence Act is to make a substantive rule of law that confessions whenever and wherever made to the police shall be presumed to have been obtained under the circumstances mentioned in p Section 24 and, therefore, inadmissible except so far as is provided in Section 27, of that Act. The term \"Police officer\" has not been defined in the Evidence Act. Shri R. K. Garg, appearing for the appellant, submits that the expression \"police officer\" in Section 25, Evidence Act must be construed in a wide popular sense, so as to include within its ambit all officers of Government who are, in substance, invested with the power to investigate certain offences in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (for short, called the Code). irrespective of the fact that they are differently labelled such as, Excise officers or Customs officers or members of the RPF, otherwise, the very object of Section 25 will be defeated. In support of this contention, the learned counsel has referred to the decision of this Court 183 in Raja Ram Jaiswal vs State of Bihar. The point pressed into argument is that an Inspector of the RPF making an inquiry under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act. 1966 into an offence under Section 3 of that Act, in substance. acts and exercises almost all the powers of a 'Police officer ' making an investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure. If that be the correct position proceeds the argument any confessional statement recorded by such Inspector will be hit by section 25, Evidence Act, and if that statement falls short of a 'confession ', then also, it will not be admissible in evidence against its maker, at his trial because of the bar in section 162. Criminal Procedure Code. As against the above, Shri Nain submits that an officer of the RPF while making an inquiry under the 1966 Act cannot be equated with a Police officer in charge of a Police Station making an investigation under the Code. One important difference in their powers is, that the RPF Inspector has no power to submit a report or chargesheet under section 173 of the Code. Shri Nain has further pointed out that Raja Ram Jaiswal 's case stands on its own peculiar facts, and was distinguished in a later decision by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Badku Joti Savant vs State of Mysore. According to Shri Nain, the correct test for determining whether or not a RPF officer is a 'Police officer ' for the purpose of section 25. Evidence Act, is the one which was consistently applied in State of Punjab vs Barkat Ram; Badku Joti Savant (ibid); Romesh Chandra Mehta vs West Bengal. To top it all, it is maintained, the question is now no longer res integra and has been concluded by the recent judgment of this Court in State of U.P. vs Durga Prasad. In reply, Shri R.K. Garg has tried to distinguish Durga Prasad 's case, ibid, on the ground, that therein the question whether or not an officer of the RPF is a Police officer within the contemplation of section 25 of the Evidence Act, was not directly in issue. It is maintained that the only question for decision in that case was. Whether an enquiry conducted under section 8(1) of the 1966 Act can be deemed to be an investigation for the purpose of section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. and this question was answered in the negative. In the alternative, it is urged that Durga Prasad 's case was not correctly decided and its ratio needs reconsideration by a larger Bench because it has overlooked the test laid down by the 3 Judge Bench in Raja Ram laiswal 's case. 184 Although Durga Prasad 's case very largely appears to conclude this question, yet, in deference to the last argument of Shri Garg, we propose to deal with the other decisions of this Court. which have been referred to by counsel on both sides. At the outset, for the sake of perspective, we may notice the relevant provisions of the 1966 Act and the Railway Protection Force Act ]957 (for short called the 1957 Act). First we will notice the relevant features of the 1957 Act whereunder the RPF was constituted. The preamble of the 1957 Act states that its object is to provide for the constitution and regulation of a Force called the Railway Protection Force for the better protection and security of railway property. The various clauses in Section 2 contains definitions. The definition of \"railway property\" in clause (e) \"includes any goods, money or valuable security, or animal, belonging to, or in the charge or possession of. a railway administration.\" \"Member of The Force\" means \"a person appointed to the Force under this Act other than a superior officer\". Clause (c) \"superior officer\" means any of the officers appointed under section 4. Clause (g) says that the words and expressions used but not defined in this Act and defined in the Indian Railways Act 1890, shall have the meanings respectively assigned to them under that Act. Section 3 gives powers to the Central Government to constitute and maintain the Force. Section 5 enumerates the classes of officers; Inspector/Sub Inspector/Assistant Sub Inspector. Section 10 says that the officers and members of the Force shall be deemed to be 'railway servants ' within the meaning of the Indian Railways Act. Section 11 is important. It enumerates That, the duty of every superior officer and member of the Force shall be (a) promptly to execute all orders lawfully issued to him by his superior authority; (b) to protect and safeguard railway property; (c) to remove any obstruction in the movement of railway property; and (d) to do any other act conducive to the better protection and security of railway property. Section 12 enables any superior officer or member of the Force to arrest, without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant \"(a) any person who has been concerned in an offence relating to railway property punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding six months, or against whom a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned; or 185 (b) any person found taking precautions to conceal his presence within railway limits under circumstances which afford reason to believe that he is taking such precautions with a view to committing theft of, or damage to, railway property. \" Section 13 provides: \"Whenever any superior officer, or any member of the Force, not below the rank of a Senior Rakshak, has reason to believe that any such offence as is referred to in section 12 has been nor is being committed and that a search warrant cannot be obtained without affording the offender an opportunity of escaping or of concealing evidence of the offence, he may detain him and search his person and belongings forthwith and, if he thinks proper, arrest any person whom he has reason to believe to have committed the offence. Under sub section (2), the provisions of the Code, relating to searches under that Code shall, so far as may be, apply to searches under this section. Section 14 indicates the procedure to be followed after arrest. According to it, any superior officer or member of the Force making an arrest under this Act, shall without unnecessary delay. make over the person arrested to a police officer, or, in the absence of a Police officer, take such person or cause him to be taken to the nearest police station. Section 17 provides penalties for neglect of duty, etc. Section 20 gives protection to a member of the Force for any act done by him in the discharge of his duties. Section 21 gives powers to the Central Government to make rules for carrying out the purposes of this Act. Clause (b) of sub section (2) of this section says that such rules may provide, inter alia, for regulating the powers and duties of superior officers and members of the Force authorised to exercise any functions by or under this Act. From the above survey, it will be seen that the primary object of constituting the Railway Protection Force is to secure better \"protection and security of the railway property.\" The restricted power of arrest and search given to the officers or members of the Force is incidental to the efficient discharge of their basic duty to protect and safeguard Railway Property. No general power to investigate all cognizable offences relating to Railway Property, under the Criminal Procedure Code has been conferred on any superior officer or member of the Force by the 1957 Act. Section 14 itself makes it clear that even with regard to an offence relating to 'railway property ', the superior officer or member of the Force making an arrest under section 13 shall forthwith make over the person arrested to a police officer, or cause his production in the nearest police station. Now, we will take up the 1966 Act, which came into force on September 16, 1966. As is evident from its preamble, it is an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to unlawful possession of 186 Railway Property. The material part of the objects and Reasons for moving the Bill which became this Act, is as under: \"2. At present, offences against Railway property are being dealt with under Railway Stores (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1955, but this Act has been found, by experience, to be ineffective in tackling with the enormity of the problems of theft and pilferages on Railways. As it is, this Act makes unlawful possession of Railway Stores an Defence, but it is only applicable to unlawful possession of Railway property owned by the Railways, and does not cover the offences relating to goods and parcels entrusted to Railways for transport. Further, the offences under this Act are investigated and enquired into by local police in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. It has been observed that the two Agencies, i.e. the Government Railway Police and Railway Protection Force, which are at present provided to deal with crimes on railways find themselves handicapped, for different reasons, in effectively dealing with the problem of theft and pilferage of Railway Property. The Railways are spread out over a large part of the country and property, etc., entrusted to them is carried from one part to another usually crossing boundaries of different states. The jurisdiction of State Police being restricted to the State boundary only, it becomes difficult at times for the Police to make thorough and fruitful investigation into offences relating to Railway Property. Besides, investigation of cases in respect of Railway Property also requires a specialised knowledge of Railway working. The Railway Protection Force, on the other hand, are not at present equipped with requisite powers of investigation and prosecution, with the result that whatever action they take in respect of prevention etc., is taken just in aid of the State Police who conduct investigation and prosecution etc. Due to this fact of two agencies being responsible for achieving the same object, the machinery has not proved as effective as it ought to have. 4, It is, therefore, proposed to replace the Railway Stores (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1955, by a more comprehensive Act so as to bring with its ambit the unlawful possession of goods entrusted to the Railways as common carriers and to make the punishment for such offences more deterrent. It is also proposed to invest powers of investigation and prosecution of offences relating to Railway Property in the Railway Protection Force in the same manner as in the Excise and Customs.\" (emphasis added) 187 From what has been quoted above, it is clear that the main purpose of passing the 1966 Act was to \"invest powers of investigation and prosecution\" of offences relating to railway property in the RPF \"in the same manner as in the Excise and Customs\". We will advert to this point later. Suffice it to say here that in view of the aforesaid object of enacting the 1966 Act. the decisions of this Court on the question as to whether an Excise officer/Customs officer is a \"Police officer\", within the purview of section 25, Evidence Act, or section 162, Criminal Procedure Code, assume analogical importance for the purpose of deciding the precise question before us. The various clauses of section 2 of the 1966 Act, contain definitions. Clause (c) defines \"officer of the Force\" to mean \"an officer of and above the rank of Assistant Sub Inspector appointed to the Force and includes a superior officer. \" The definition of \"railway property\" in clause (d) has been expanded so as to include goods entrusted to the Railway for carriage or transport, belonging to another person. Section 3 provides: \"Whoever is found. Or is proved to have been, in possession of any railway property reasonably suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained shall, unless he proves that the railway property came into his possession lawfully be punishable (a) for the first offence with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both and; in the absence of . special and adequate reasons to be mentioned in the judgment of the Court, such imprisonment shall not be less than two years and such fine shall not be less than two thousand rupees; and (b) for the second or a subsequent offence, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and also with fine and in the absence of special and adequate reasons to be mentioned in the judgment of the Court such imprisonment shall not be less than two years and such fine shall not be less than two thousand rupees\". It will be seen that if any person is found or proved to be in possession of any 'railway property ', which is reasonably suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained, the burden shall shift on to that person to prove his innocence, that is to say, to establish that he came into possession of the 'railway property ' lawfully. Section 4 provides punishment for persons wilfully conniving at an offence under the provisions of this Act. 188 Section 5 says: \"Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, an offence under this Act shall not be cognizable\". It may be noted that in spite of provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure to the contrary, offences under this Act have been made non cognizable and, as such, cannot be investigated by a police officer under the Code. It follows that the initiation of prosecution for an offence inquired into under this Act can only be on the basis of a complaint by an officer of RPF and not on the report of a police officer under section 173(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. Section 6 gives powers to any superior officer or member of the Force to arrest without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant, any person who has been concerned in an offence punishable under this Act, or against whom a reasonable suspicion existed of his having been so concerned. Section 7 of the Act provides that the procedure for investigation of a cognizable offence has to be followed by the officer before whom the accused Person is produced. Reading section 7 of the 1966 Act with that of section 14 of the 1957 Act, it is clear that while in the case of a person arrested under section 12 of the 1957 Act the only course open to the superior officer or member of the Force was to make over the person arrested to a police officer, in the case of a person arrested for a suspected offence under the 1966 Act, he is required to be produced without delay before the nearest officer of the Force, who shall obviously be bound (in view of Article 22(1) of the Constitution) to produce him further before the Magistrate concerned. Section 8 of the 1966 Act is new. It provides for an inquiry to be made against the arrested persons. According to it, when any person is arrested by an officer of the Force for an offence punishable under this Act or is forwarded to him under section 7, he shall proceed to inquire into the charge against such person. It is to be noted that such power of inquiry, has been conferred on an officer of the Force, although he is not an officer incharge of a police station as envisaged by section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Sub section (2) of this section confers on the officer of the Force \"the same powers\" for the purpose of the inquiry under sub section (1) and subject to the same provisions \"as the officer incharge of a police station may exercise and is subject under the Code of. Criminal Procedure, 1898 when investigating a cognizable case. \" Then there is a proviso which says: 189 \"Provided that (a) if the officer of the Force is of opinion that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused person, he shall either admit him to bail to appear before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, or forward him in custody to such Magistrate; (b) if it appears to the officer of the Force that there is not sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused person, he shall release the accused person on his executing a bond, with or without sureties as the officer of the Force may direct, to appear, if and when so required, before the Magistrate having jurisdiction, and shall make a full report of all the particulars of the case to his official superior. \" Section 9 gives powers to an officer of the Force to summon persons to give evidence and produce documents, or any other thing in any inquiry for any of the purposes of this Act. Sub sections (3) and (4) provide: \"(3) All persons, so summoned, shall be bound to attend either in person or by an authorised agent as such officer may direct; and all persons so summoned shall be bound to state the truth upon any subject respecting which they are examined or make statements and to produce such documents and other things as may be required: Provided that the exemption under section 132 and 133 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, shall be applicable to requisitions for attendance under this section.\" \"(4) Every such inquiry as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a 'judicial proceeding ' within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code.\" Section 10 enables an officer of the Force, having reason for the requisite belief to apply for a search warrant to the Magistrate. Section 11 provides that searches and arrests shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Code. Section 14 makes it clear that the provisions of the Act shall override all other laws. This means that if there is anything in the 1966 Act which is inconsistent with the Code, then on that point, the 1966 Act will prevail and the application of the Code pro tanto will be excluded. The most important example of such exclusion, as already noticed, is to be found in section 5 of the 1966 Act which makes as offence under this Act non cognizable, notwithstanding anything in the Code. This clearly shows that the provisions of the Code cannot 190 proprio vigore apply to an enquiry conducted under section 8(1) of the 1966 Act by an officer of the Force. Further, section 6 of the 1966 Act empowers an officer or member of the Force to arrest without a warrant and without an order of the Magistrate any person concerned, or reasonably suspected of being concerned in an offence under the 1966 Act. This again is contrary to the scheme and content of the Code which must give way to the 1966 Act in this matter. The third material aspect in which an inquiry under the 1966 Act, differs from investigation under the Code, is to be found in Section 9(3) whereunder persons summoned to, appear in the inquiry are expressly mandated to state the truth. In contrast with this, Section 160 of the Code does not expressly bind persons examined in Police investigation, to state the truth. The inquiry under Section 8(1) of the 1966 Act in view of Section 9(4) shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding for the purpose of Sections 193 and 228 of the Penal Code. But a police investigation under Section 160 of the Code does not partake of the character of a judicial proceeding for any purpose and a witness examined during such investigation cannot be prosecuted under Section 193, Penal Code. The fourth important aspect in which the power and duty of an officer of the RPF conducting an inquiry under the 1966 Act, differs from a police investigation under the Code, is this Sub section (3) of Section 161 of the Code says that the police officer may reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of investigation. Section 162(1), which is to be read in continuation of Section 161 of the Code, prohibits the obtaining of signature of the person on his statement recorded by the investigating officer. But no such prohibition attaches to statements recorded in the course of an inquiry under the 1966 Act; rather, from the obligation to state the truth under pain of prosecution enjoined by Section 9(3) and (4), it follows as a corollary, that the officer conducting the inquiry may obtain signature of the person who made the statement. Fifthly, under the provision to sub section (1) of Section 162 of the Code, oral or recorded statement made to a police officer during investigation may be used by the accused, and with the permission of the Court, by the prosecution to contradict the statement made by the witness in Court in the manner provided in Section 145, Evidence Act, or when the witness ' statement is so used in cross examination, he may be reexamined if any explanation is necessary. The statement of a witness made to a police officer during investigation cannot be used for any other purpose, whatever, except of course 191 when it falls within Sections 32 or 27 of he Evidence Act. The prohibition contained in Section 162 extends to all statements, confessional or otherwise during a police investigation made by any person whether accused or not, whether reduced to writing or not, subject to the proviso. In contrast with the Code, in the 1966 Act, there is no provision analogous to the proviso to Section 162(1) of the Code, which restricts or prohibits the use of a statement recorded by an officer in the course of an inquiry under Sections 8 and 9 of the Act. Sixthly, the primary duty of a member/officer of RPF is to safeguard and protect railway property. Only such powers of arrest and inquiry have been conferred by the 1966 Act on members of RPF as are necessary and incidental to the efficient and effective discharge of the basic duty of watch and ward. Unlike a police officer who has a general power under the Code to investigate all cognizable cases, the power of an officer of the RPF to make an inquiry is restricted to offences under the 1966 Act. Last but not the least, under Section 190 of the Code, a Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance of an offence only in three ways, namely, (a) \"upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute an offence; (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer, and (c) upon information received from any person other than a Police officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has been committed\". The 'report ' mentioned in clause (b), includes the report made by a police officer under Section 173 after completing investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code. Section 173, in terms makes is clear that the duty of making a report thereunder on completion of the investigation to the Magistrate, is that of the officer in charge of the police station. Such a report shall include the opinion of the police officer as to the result of the investigation. The formation of such opinion is the final step in the investigation and that final step is to be taken by the police officer in charge of the station and by no other authority (Abhinandan Jha vs Dinesh Mishra). An officer of the RPF making an inquiry under the 1966 Act, cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be called an \"officer in charge of a Police Station\" within the meaning of Sections 173 and 190(b) of the Code. The made of initiating prosecution by submitting a report under Section 173 read with clause (b) of Section 190 of the Code is, therefore, not available to an officer of the RPF who has completed an inquiry into an offence under the 1966 Act. The only mode of initiating prosecution of the 192 person against whom he has successfully completed the inquiry, available to an officer of the RPF, is by making a complaint under Section 190(1)(a) of the Code to the Magistrate empowered to try the offence. That an officer of the Force conducting an inquiry under Section 8(1) cannot initiate proceedings in court by a report under Sections 173/190(1)(b) of the Code, is also evident from the provisos to sub section (2) of Section 8 of the 1966 Act. Under proviso (a), if such officer is of opinion that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused, he shall either direct him (after admitting him to bail) to appear before the Magistrate having jurisdiction or forward him in custody to such Magistrate. Under proviso (b), if it appears to he officer that there is no sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused, he shall release him on bond to appear before the Magistrate concerned \"and shall make a full report of all the particulars of the case to his superior officer\". Provisos (a) and (b) put it beyond doubt that where after completing an inquiry, the officer of the Force is of opinion that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused, he must initiate prosecution of the accused by making a complaint under Section 190(1) (a) of the Code to the Magistrate competent to try the case. From the comparative study of the relevant provisions of the 1966 Act and the Code, it is abundantly clear that an officer of the RPF making an inquiry under Section 8(1) of the 1966 Act does not possess several important attributes of an officer in charge of a police station conducting an investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code. The character of the 'inquiry ' is different from that of an 'investigation ' under the Code. The official status and powers of an officer of the Force in the matter of inquiry under the 1966 Act differ in material aspects from those of a police officer conducting an investigation under the Code. The ground is now clear for noticing the rulings cited at the Bar. In State of Punjab vs Barkat Ram (ibid), the question was whether a Customs officer can be regarded as a 'police officer ' within the purview of Section Evidence Act. This decision was rendered by a Bench of three learned Judges. The judgment of the Court was delivered by majority (consisting of Raghubar Dayal and J.L. Kapur JJ.). Subba Rao J. (as he then was wrote a dissenting opinion. The view taken by the Court Majority was to the effect: \"that the powers which the police officers enjoy are powers for the effective prevention and detection of crime in order to maintain law and order. Although the expression 'police officer\" has to be construed in a wide and popular sense, yet it has not 193 so wide a meaning as to include officers interested in the duty of detecting and preventing smuggling and similar offences with the object of safeguarding the levying and recovery of Customs duties. He is more concerned with the goods and customs duty than with the offender. The duties of customs officers are very much different from those of police officers and their possessing certain powers, which may have similarity with those of police officers, for the purpose of detecting the smuggling of goods and the persons responsible for it, would not make them police officers. Merely because similar powers in regard to the detection of infraction of Customs laws have been conferred on officers of the Police is not a sufficient ground for holding them to be police officers within the purview of Section 25 of the Evidence Act. The Customs officers, when they act under the Sea Customs Act to prevent the smuggling of goods by imposing confiscation and penalties, act judicially. The Police officers never act judicially. Hence, a Customs officer either under the , or under the , is not a police officer for the purpose of Section 25, Evidence Act. \" In his dissenting opinion, Subba Rao J., held that Section 25, Evidence Act was enacted to subserve a high purpose and that is to prevent the police from obtaining confession by force, torture or inducement. The salutary principle underlying the Section would apply equally to other officers, by whatever designation they may be known, who have thepower and duty to detect and investigate into crimes and is for that purpose in a position to extract confessions from the accused It is not the garb or the designation under which the officer functions that matters, but the nature of the power he exercises or the character of the function he performs, is decisive.\nThe question therefore, in each case is, does the officer under a particular Act substantially exercise the powers and discharge the duties of prevention and detection of crime? If he does, he will be a police officer.\nThe learned Judge quoted with approval the view of Balakrishna Ayyar, J. in Paramasivam 's case that if the officer 's powers and duties are substantially those of a police officer, but are confined to a particular extent of territory or to a particular subject matter he will be a police officer only in respect of that territory or that subject matter.\nOn this reasoning, Subba Rao J. held that a Customs officer is a police officer qua his police functions.\nThe next case is Raja Ram Jaiswal (ibid) decided by a three Judge Bench.\nThere, the question was, whether an Excise officer 194 exercising the power of investigation under the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915, is a 'police officer ' within the meaning of Section 25, Evidence Act, Mudholkar, J. speaking for himself and Subba Rao, J., answered this question in the affirmative.\nWhat the majority held in that case may be summed up as under: The test for determining whether a person is a \"police officer\" for the purpose of Section 25, Evidence Act would be whether the powers of a police officer which are conferred on him or which are exercisable by him because he is deemed to be an officer in charge of a police station establish a direct or substantial relationship with the prohibition enacted by Section 25, Evidence Act, that is, the recording of a confession.\nIn other words, whether the powers conferred on the Excise officer under the Act are such as would tend to facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession from a suspect delinquent.\nIf they do, then it is unnecessary to consider the dominant purpose for which he is appointed or the question as to what other powers he enjoys.\nIt was further held that unlike the Customs officer on whom are conferred by the , powers of a limited character, which are analogous to those conferred on police officers, are not by themselves sufficient to facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession.\nIt is the possession of these powers which enables police officers and those who are deemed to be police officers to exercise a kind of authority over the persons arrested which facilitate the obtaining from them statements which may be incriminating to the persons making them.\nThe law allows the police officer to obtain such statements with a view to facilitate the investigation of the offences.\nBut, it renders them inadmissible in evidence for the obvious reason that a suspicion about voluntariness would attach to them.\nIt is the power of investigation which establishes a direct relationship with the prohibition enacted in Section 25.\nTherefore, where such a power is conferred upon an officer, the mere fact that he possesses some other powers under another law would not make him any the less a police officer for the purposes of Section 25.\nHence, a confession made by an accused under the Bihar and Orissa Act, recorded by an Excise Inspector who is empowered to investigate any offence under the Act, is inadmissible by reasons of the provisions of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.\nRaghubar Dayal, J., however, expressed a contrary opinion.\nHe held that the Excise Inspectors empowered by the State Government under Section 77(2) of the Bihar Act, are not 'police officers ' within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act and that the aforesaid officers cannot be treated to he police officers for the purposes of Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 162 does not 195 confer any power on a police officer.\nIt deals with the use which can be made of the statements recorded by a police officer carrying out investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code.\nThe investigation which the aforesaid Excise officer conducts is not under Chapter XIV of the Code, but is under the provisions of the Act and therefore, this is a further reason for non applicability of Section 162 of the Code to any statements made by a person to an Excise officer during the course of his investigating an offence under the Act.\nAlthough in Raja Ram Jaiswal 's case, the majority judgment distinguished the earlier decision in Barkat Ram 's case on the ground that therein, the question whether officers of departments other than the police on whom powers of an officer in charge of a police station under clause 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are conferred are police officers or not for the purpose of Section 25, Evidence Act, was left open and undecided, yet the fact remains that some of the criteria adopted by the majority in Barkat Ram 's case in arriving at the decision they did, in a Customs officer 's case was rejected and the test indicated by Subba Rao, J. in his minority judgment was substantially approved.\nBe that as it may, on facts, the distinguishing feature of Raja Ram Jaiswal 's case was that under the Bihar Excise Act, the powers of an officer in charge of a Police Station were expressly conferred on the Excise officer concerned in respect of the area to which he was appointed.\nThe question whether a Deputy Superintendent of Customs and Excise was a 'police officer ' within the meaning of Section 25, Evidence Act, again came up for consideration before a Constitution Bench in Badku Joti Savant 's case, ibid.\n, Wanchoo, J. who delivered the unanimous opinion of the Bench, answered this question (at page 701), thus: \"There has been difference of opinion among the High Courts in India as to the meaning of the words \"police officer\" used in Section 25 of the Evidence Act.\nOne view has been that those words must be construed in a broad way and all officers whether they are police officers properly so called or not would be police officers within the meaning of those words if they have all the powers of a police officer with respect to investigation of offences with which they are concerned.\nThe leading case i support of this view is Nanoo Sheikh Ahmed vs Emperor.\nThis view approved by Subba Rao J. in his minority judgment in Barkat Ram 's case).\nThe other view which may be called the 196 narrow view is that the words \"police officer\" in Section 25 of the Evidence Act mean a police officer properly so called and do not include officers of other departments of government who may be charged with the duty to investigate under special Acts special crimes thereunder like excise offences or customs offences, and so on.\nThe leading case in support of this view is Radha Kishun Marwari vs King Emperor.\nThe other High Courts have followed one view or the other, the majority being in favour of the view taken by the Bombay High Court.\nWe shall proceed on the assumption that the broad view may be accepted and that requires an examination of the various provisions of the Act to which we turn now. (After examining some provision of the Central Act 1 of 1944, the judgment proceeded)\".\n\"It is urged that under sub section (2) of Section 21 a Central Excise officer under the Act has all the powers of an officer in charge of a police station under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure and therefore he must be deemed to be a police officer within the meaning of those words in Section 25 of the Evidence Act.\nIt is true that sub section (2) confers on the Central Excise officer under the Act the same powers as an officer in charge of a police station has when investigating a cognizable case; but this power is conferred for the purpose of sub section (1) which gives power to a Central Excise officer to whom any arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the charge against him.\nThus under section 21 it is the duty of the Central Excise officer to whom an arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the charge made against such person.\nFurther under proviso (a) to sub section {2) of section 21 if the Central Excise officer is of opinion that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused person, he shall either admit him to bail to appear before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, or forward him in custody to such Magistrate.\nIt does not however appear that a Central Excise officer under the Act has power to submit a charge sheet under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nUnder Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a Magistrate can take cognizance of any offence either (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence, of (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer, or (c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has been committed.\n197 police officer for purposes of clause (b) above can in our opinion only be a police officer properly so called as the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure shows and it seems therefore that a Central Excise officer will have to make a complaint under clause (a) above if he wants the Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence, for example, under Section 9 of the Act.\nThus though under sub section (2) of Section 21 of the Central Excise officer under the Act has the powers of an officer in charge of a police station when investigating a cognizable case that is for the purpose of his inquiry under sub section (1) of Section 21.\n\" The Court then distinguished Raja Ram Jaiswal 's case, thus: \"Section 21 (of the Central Excises and Salt Act No. 44) is in terms different from Section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915, which came to be considered in Raja Ram Jaiswal 's case, and which provided in terms that \"for the purposes of Section 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, the area to which an excise officer empowered under Section 77, Sub section (2), is appointed shall be deemed to be a police station, and such officer shall be deemed to be the officer in charge of such station\".\nIt, therefore, cannot be said that the provision in Section 21 is on par with the provision in Section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act.\nAll that Section 21 provides is that for the purpose his inquiry, a Central Excise officer shall have the powers of an officer in charge of a police station when investigating a cognizable case.\nBut even so it appears that these powers do not include the power to submit a charge sheet under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for unlike the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, the Central Excise officer is not deemed to be an officer in charge of a police station.\n\" On the above reasoning, the Court concluded that \"mere conferment of powers of investigation into criminal offences under Section 9 of the Act does not make the Central Excise officer a police officer even in the broader view mentioned above\".\nFollowing the decisions in Punjab State vs Barkat Ram (ibid), and Badku Joti Savant vs Mysore State (ibid), a Constitution Bench of this Court, in Ramesh Chandra vs State of West Bengal (ibid), reiterated that the test for determining whether an officer of customs is to be deemed a police officer is whether he is invested with all the powers of a police officer qua investigation of an offence, including the power to submit a report under Section 198 173, Code of Criminal Procedure.\nApplying this test, the Court held that since a Customs officer exercising power to make an inquiry cannot submit a report under Section 198 173 of the Code, he is not a police officer within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.\nAgain in Illias vs Collector of Customs, this Court held that although a Customs officer under the , has been invested with many of the powers similar to those exercisable by a police officer under Chapter XIV of the Code which he did not have under the old Act yet he is not empowered to file a chargesheet under Section 173 of the Code and therefore, he cannot be regarded as a \"police officer\" within the meaning of Section 25, Evidence Act.\nShri Garg tried to distinguish these cases on the ground that they relate to Customs officers or Excise officers whose primary duties are to collect and prevent evasion of revenues, and that some of the powers of a police officer are conferred on them merely for the effective discharge of their duties as revenue officers.\nIt is submitted that the members of the RPF are not revenue officers and their duties are confined to the protection of railway property, and prevention, detection and investigation of crimes relating to 'railway property '.\nRelying on the decision in Raja Ram Jaiswal 's case, it is urged that the real test to be applied for determining this question, is, whether the police powers conferred on an officer of the RPF are such as would tend to tempt or facilitate the obtaining by him a confession from a person suspected of the commission of an offence under the 1966 Act.\nIt is argued that since an officer of the RPF conducting an inquiry has been invested qua 'railway property ' with almost all the powers or an officer in charge of a Police Station making an investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code, this test is amply satisfied to hold that he is a 'police officer ' within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.\nAt one stage, it was contended by Shri Garg that it could be spelled out from Section 8(2) of the 1966 Act that an officer of the Force had the power to present a charge sheet under Section 173 of the Code, also.\nIn the alternative, it was submitted that the mere fact that an officer of the Force could initiate prosecution only by filing a complaint and not by making a report under Section 173 of the Code, was immaterial in regard to the satisfaction of This test, if, in fact, he had been invested with all other powers of investigation exercisable by a police officer under the Code, qua offences under the 1966 Act.\nPrima facie there is much to be said for the reasoning advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant, but as a matter of judicial discipline we cannot deviate from the ratio of Punjab State vs Barkat 199 Ram and Badku Joti Savant 's case, and the primary test enunciated therein for determining this question.\nIndeed, we are bound by the decision in State of U.P. vs Durga Prasad (ibid) which, following the ratio of the aforesaid cases, has held that an officer of the RPF conducting an inquiry under Section 8(1) of the 1966 Act, cannot be equated with an officer in charge of a Police Station making an investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code.\nIt may be recalled that the primary test evolved in Badku Joti Savant 's case by the Constitution Bench, is: Whether the officer concerned under the special Act, has been invested with all the powers exercisable by an officer in charge of a Police Station under Chapter XIV of the Code, qua investigation of offences under that Act, including the power to initiate prosecution by submitting a report (chargesheet) under Section 173 of the Code.\nIn order to bring him within The purview of a 'police officer ' for the purpose of Section 25.\nEvidence Act, it is not enough to show that he exercises some or even many of the powers of a police officer conducting an investigation under the Code.\nNor is the ratio of the aforesaid decisions inapplicable merely because they related to a Customs officer or an Excise officer, and not to an officer of the RPF.\nThe factual premises on which the ratio of Badku Joti Savant 's rests were substantially analogous to those of the instant case.\nThat is to say, the powers of arrest, inquiry and investigation conferred on the Central Excise officers under Act 1 of 1944 (which was under consideration in that case) are very similar to those with which an officer of the RPF is invested under the 1966 Act.\nUnder Section 13 of that Act of 1944, any Central Excise officer duly empowered by the Central Government in this behalf can arrest any person whom he has reason to believe to be liable to punishment. 'Section 18 provides that all searches made under that Act or any rules made thereunder shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.\nSection 19 of that Act lays down that every person arrested under the Act shall be forwarded without delay to the nearest Central Excise officer empowered to send person so arrested to a Magistrate, or, if there is no such Central Excise officer within a reasonable distance, to the officer in charge of the nearest police station.\nSection 21 of the Act provides: \"(1) When any person is forwarded under Section 19 to a Central Excise officer empowered to send persons so arrested to a Magistrate, the Central Excise officer shall proceed to inquire into the charge against him.\n200 (2) For this purpose the Central Excise officer may exercise the same powers and shall be subject to the same provisions as the officer in charge of a police station may exercise and is subject to under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, when investigating a cognizable case.\n\" It will be seen that these provisions in Sections 13, 18, 19 and 21 of the Central Act I of 1944, substantially correspond to the provisions in Sections 6, 7, 8 etc.\nOf the 1966 Act, which we have already noticed It will bear repetition that sub section 12) of section 8, under which an officer of the Force conducting an inquiry may exercise the same powers as an officer in charge of a police station investigating a cognizable case under the Code, is in pari materia with sub section (2) of Section 21 of Act 1 of 1944.\nIt may be recalled that in the objects and Reasons of the Bill, which was enacted as 1966 Act, it was stated that this measure invests \"powers of investigation and prosecution of offences relating to Railway Property in the Railway Protection Force in the same manner as in the Excise and Customs\".\nThe 1966 Act thus brings the status of officers of the RPF in the matter of inquiry, investigation and prosecution of offences under the Act substantially at par with that of an Excise officer under the Central Act 1 of 1944 and that of a Customs Officer under the .\nThe ratio of all the decisions noticed earlier, therefore, applies in full force to the case of an officer of the RPF making an inquiry into an offence under the 1966 Act.\nIn State of U.P. vs Durga Prasad (ibid), after carefully examining and comparing the powers of arrest, inquiry and investigation of an officer of the Force under the 1966 Act with those of a police officer under he Code, it was pointed out that such an officer of the RPF does not possess all the attributes of an officer in charge of a police station investigating a case under Chapter XIV of the Code.\nHe possesses but a part of those attributes limited to the purpose of holding the inquiry under the Act.\nOn these premises, it was held that an officer of the RPF making an inquiry under the 1966 Act, cannot be equated with an investigating police officer.\nIn reaching this conclusion, Chandrachud, J. (as he then was), speaking for the Court, appears to have applied the same test which was adopted in Badku Joti Savant 's case, when he observed: \"The right and duty of an investigating officer to file a police report or a charge sheet on the conclusion of investigation is the hallmark of an investigation under the Code.\nSection 173(1)(a) of 201 the Code provides that as soon as the investigation is completed the officer in charge of the police station shall forward to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report, a report in the form prescribed by the State Government.\nThe officer conducting an inquiry under Section 8(1) cannot initiate court proceedings by filing a police report.\n\" The decision in Raja Ram Jaiswal 's case, on which Shri Garg relies, was distinguished, as was done in Badku Joti Savant 's case, on the ground that Jaiswal 's case involved the interpretation of Section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915.\nIn the light of the above discussion, it is clear that an officer of the RPF conducting an enquiry under Section 8(1) of the 1966 Act has not been invested with all the powers of an officer in charge of a police station making an investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code.\nParticularly, he has no power to initiate prosecution by filing a charge sheet before the Magistrate concerned under Section 173 of the Code, which has been held to be the clinching attribute of an investigating 'police officer '.\nThus, judged by the test laid down in Badku Jyoti Savant 's, which has been consistently adopted in the subsequent decisions noticed above, Inspector Kakade of the RPF could not be deemed to be a 'police officer ' within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, and therefore, any confessional or incriminating statement recorded by him in the course of an inquiry under Section 8(1) of the 1966 Act, cannot be excluded from evidence under the said section.\nThis takes us to the second question.\nQuestion II The main contention of Shri Garg is that any confessional or incriminating statements recorded by an officer of the Force in the course of an inquiry under section 8(1) of the 1966 Act, cannot be used as evidence against the appellant in view of the constitutional ban against \"compelled testimony\" imposed by Article 20(3) of the Constitution.\nThe argument is that as soon as a person is arrested by an officer of the Force on a suspicion or charge of committing an offence punishable under the 1966 Act, he stands in the character of a \"person accused of an offence\".\nThat being the case proceeds the argument a statement made by such an accused person to an officer of the RPF making an inquiry against him can never be said to be voluntary, being subject to a legal compulsion under Section 9(3) of the 1966 Act to state the truth 202 upon any subject respecting which he is examined even if such state of might incriminate him.\nOn these premises it is maintained that both the conditions necessary for attraction of the ban in Article 20(3) of the Constitution exist in the case of such statements.\nIn this connection, Shri Garg has referred to the dissenting judgment of Subba Rao, J. in Barkat Ram (ibid); Kathi Raning Rawat vs The State of Saurashtra; K. Joseph Augusthi & Ors.\nvs M.A. Narayanan; Mohamed Dastagir vs The State of Madras; Bhagwan Das vs Union of India; Ramanlal Bhogilal Shah & Anr.\nvs D.K. Guha & Ors.; M.P. Sharma vs Satish Chandra; Smt.\nNandini Satpathy vs P.L. Dani & Anr.\n; and In re The Special Courts Bill.\nAs against this, Mr. Nain, appearing for the respondent State, submits that the conditions necessary for the attraction of the ban in Article 20(3) do not exist in the instant case, because before the filing of the complaint in the Court, the appellant was not a \"person accused of an offence\".\nIt is further urged that the compulsion contemplated by Clause (3) of Article 20 means \"physical or mental compulsion\" and not compulsion of law to state the truth; that freedom to tell lies is not within the protection of this clause.\nIt was nowhere alleged that the confessional or incriminating statements in question were extorted by the RPF officer under physical duress, threat, inducement or mental torture.\nIt is added that in any case, it is a question of fact to be established by evidence that any such compulsion was used in obtaining the incriminating statements.\nClause (3) of Article 20 of the Constitution reads, thus: \"No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.\n\" An analysis of this clause shows three things: Firstly, its protection is available only to a \"person accused of any offence\".\nSecondly, the protection is against compulsion \"to be a witness\".\nThirdly, this protection avails \"against himself\".\nIt follows that if any of these ingredients does not exist, this clause (3), will not be attracted.\nKeeping this in mind, it will be appropriate to concentrate on the first point, as to whether during the inquiry 203 under Section 8 of the 1966 Act when the appellant made the incriminating statement in question, he was a \"person accused of any offence\" within the contemplation of Article 20(3).\nIn M. P. Sharma vs Satish Chandra (ibid) which is a decision by a seven Judge Bench of this Court, it was held that determination of this issue will depend on whether at the time when the person made the self incriminatory statement, a formal accusation of the commission of an offence had been made against him.\n\"Formal accusation\" is ordinarily brought into existence by lodging of an F.I.R. Or a formal complaint to the appropriate authority or court against the specific individual, accusing him of the commission of a crime which, in the normal course, would result in his prosecution.\nIt is only on the making of such formal accusation that clause (3) of Article 20 becomes operative covering that individual with its protective umbrella against testimonial compulsion.\nThe interpretation placed by the Court in M. P. Sharma 's case.\nOn the phrase \"person accused of any offence\" used in Article 20(3) was reiterated in Bhagwan Das vs Union of India (ibid) was reaffirmed in Raja Narayanlal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry & Anr.\nAgain, in the State of Bombay vs Kathi Kalu Oghad & Ors; one of the propositions enunciated by the Court was, that to bring a statement within the prohibition of Article 20(3), the person accused must have stood in the character of an accused person at the time he made the statement.\nIt is not enough, that he should become an accused, any time after the statement has been made.\nThe same proposition was reiterated by Gajendragadkar C.J. in Joseph Augusthi (ibid), and again by the Constitution Bench in Ramesh Chand Mehta 's (ibid).\nIn the instant case, at the time when the alleged incriminating statement was made before the officer of the RPF, no formal complaint in regard to the commission of an offence had been filed against him in Court, nor had any F.I.R. been lodged with the Police, specifically accusing the appellant or the author of that statement of the commission of an offence.\nIt is, therefore, manifest that at the material time the author of the self incriminatory statements in question, did not fulfil the character of a \"person accused of an offence\" within the meaning of Article 20(3).\nThe last authority to be noticed in regard to the interpretation of the phrase \"person accused of any offence\", is Ramanlal Bhogilal Shah 's case (ibid).\nThe petitioner Ramanlal Bhogilal Shah was arrested under Section 19B of the Foreign Exchange Act.\nThe grounds 204 purportedly served on him under sub section (1) of Section 19B for the offence under Section 4(2) and Section 22 of the Act, punishable under Section 23, were elaborate.\nThe question arose whether after these grounds had been served on the petitioner, it could be said that he was 'a person accused of an offence ' within Article 20(3) of the Constitution.\nThe petitioner was produced before the Magistrate, who released him on bail.\nThereafter, First Information Report was recorded under Section 154, Criminal Procedure Code, and an order was obtained from the Magistrate, permitting the investigation to be made under Section 155(2), Criminal Procedure Code.\nThe Enforcement Officer had examined the petitioner and put his conclusions in the grounds of arrest which were served on the petitioner.\nUnder these circumstances, the Court held that the petitioner was definitely a \"person accused of an offence\" within the meaning of Article 20(3) of the Constitution and at any rate, the petitioner was accused of an offence when the F.I.R. was recorded and therefore, the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate would be illegal.\nAt the same time, it was held that although the petitioner is a 'person accused of an offence ', the only protection that Article 20(3) gave him is that he could not be compelled to be a witness against himself, but this did not mean that he need not give information regarding matters which do not tend to incriminate him.\nConsequently, the Court did not set aside the summons and held that the petitioner was bound to appear before the Enforcement Directorate and answer such questions that did not incriminate him.\nTo sum up, only a person against whom a formal accusation of the commission of an offence has been made can be a person \"accused of an offence\" within the meaning of Article 20(3).\nSuch formal accusation may be specifically made against him in an F.I.R. Or a formal complaint or any other formal document or notice served on that person, which ordinarily results in his prosecution in court.\nIn the instant case no such formal accusation had been made against the appellant when his statement(s) in question were recorded by the RPF Officer.\nAt the relevant time of making the self incriminatory statements in question, therefore, the appellant did not stand in the character of a person accused of an offence and, as such, the protection of Article 20(3), will not be available to him.\nIn view of this finding, we do not think it necessary for the decision of these appeals to go into the question whether legal compulsion to state the truth such as the one contained in Section 9(3) of the 1966 Act is, also, a compulsion interdicted by Article 20(3).\n205 In the light of what has been said above, we would answer the legal proposition (formulated as Question No. II) propounded by the learned counsel for the appellant, in the negative.\nQuestion No. 3 was not raised or pressed at the time of arguments in the courts below.\nWe, therefore, refuse to go into this question and pronounce in regard thereto.\nBefore we part with this judgment, we may note here that the learned counsel for the respondent State has very fairly stated at the bar, that the State shall have no objection to the supply of copies of all the relevant documents and statements on which the prosecution intends to rely, to the accused appellants in the trial court.\nIn view of this undertaking we thought it unnecessary to go into the legal aspects of this question.\nWe will however, add that the prosecution shall also permit the accused appellant to inspect the other material that may have been collected by the inquiry officer, relevant to the charge against the accused appellant.\nWith this observation, we would dismiss these appeals (Nos. 208 209 of 1974) and send the case back to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law.\nSince the case is already old, the proceedings shall be conducted as far as possible, from day to day on top priority basis, and disposed of preferably within three months of the date or which the records are received in the trial court.\nSince the legal questions raised before us in Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 630 of 1977 are the same as in Criminal Appeals Nos. 208 209 of 1974, and the learned counsel for the petitioners therein has adopted the arguments of Shri R.K. Garg, appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeals Nos. 208 209 of 1974, that Special Leave Petition, after granting special leave to appeal, will also stand disposed of by this judgment.\nN.V.K. Appeals dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 60 of 1955. Appeal from the judgment and order dated the 2nd February, 1955, of the Calcutta High Court in Criminal Revision No. 1113 of 1954, against the judgment and order dated the 14th November, 1953, of the Court of the Sessions Judge, Howrah in Criminal Appeal No. 185 of 1953, arising out of the judgment and order dated the 8th September, 1953, of the Municipal Magistrate, Second Class, Howrah, in Case No. 1407C/1952. Sukumar Ghose, for the appellant. B. Sen and P. K. Ghosh (for P. K. Bose), for the respondent 1957. October 29. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA J. This appeal on a certificate of fitness granted by the Calcutta High Court under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution, is directed against the judgment and order of a Single Judge of that Court in its criminal revisional jurisdiction, convicting the appellant under section 488/300 of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923 (which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act), and sentencing him to a fine of Rs. 50, in substitution of the order of conviction under section 488/299 of the Act, of a fine of Rs. 75, passed by the lower courts. The facts found by the courts below which are necessary to be stated for the purpose of this appeal, are as follows: The appellant who is the owner of the premises No. 10/3, Swarnamoyee Road, Howrah, encroached upon an area of 57' x 3' of the road side land of the Howrah Municipality to which the provisions of the Act have been extended. A notice, the terms of which we shall set out hereinafter, was served on the appellant to remove the encroachment aforesaid, and as he failed to carry out the terms of the notice within the specified time, the prosecution leading up to this appeal, was instituted before the magistrate who, under section 531, is called 'Municipal Magistrate'. The Municipal Magistrate who tried the appellant in the first instance, convicted him, but on appeal, the learned Sessions Judge acquitted him on the ground that the prosecution had been launched beyond three months which was the prescribed period of limitation under section 534 of the Act. The Municipality moved the High Court of Calcutta in its revisional jurisdiction and a Division Bench of that Court (J. P. Mitter and section K. Sen JJ.), set aside the order of acquittal and directed the appeal to be re heard, after giving the Municipality an opportunity of formally bringing on record certain official documents showing the date of the institution of the complaint. The relevant documents were proved and exhibited on behalf of the prosecution in the Sessions Court and the learned Additional Sessions Judge confirmed the conviction and the sentence, and dismissed the appeal. Thereupon, the appellant moved the High Court in its revisional jurisdiction. His application in revision was heard and disposed of by P.N. Mukherjee J. by his order dated February 2, 1955, which is the subject matter of this appeal. Before him, the appellant as petitioner, urged at the forefront of the arguments, the question of limitation, and the learned Judge took the view that the matter was now concluded in view of what had taken place in the High Court and in the court of Session in pursuance of the order of remand passed by the High Court. The learned Judge agreed with the appellate court that the complaint was not barred. The High Court also agreed with the lower courts on their findings on the merits, that is to say, it affirmed the finding that the appellant had encroached upon the road side land of the Municipality. The High Court accepted the argument raised on behalf of the appellant that on the facts found, namely, that the offending structure was a compound wall and not something which was a part and parcel of the main building, the offence if any, would come under section 300, and not section 299, read with section 488 of the Act. The High Court further took the view that as the accused was fully aware of the nature of the accusation against him, it would not cause any prejudice to him if the conviction and the sentence were altered into those under section 300, read with section 488 of the Act, the sentence being reduced to the statutory limit of 50 rupees. The appellant moved the High Court and obtained the necessary certificate from the Bench presided over by the learned Chief Justice who observed, while granting the certificate: 'It seems to me to be arguable and arguable with some force that such alteration of the conviction could not possibly be correct in law. . . It would therefore be arguable that a notice under section 299 to remove a compound wall unattached to any building could not be a notice 'lawfully given' or a requisition 'lawfully made' within the meaning of section 488(1)(c) of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923. It appears to me that the alteration of the conviction by this Court does raise a question of law which makes the case a fit case for further appeal to the Supreme Court.' In this Court, the learned counsel for the appellant has placed at the forefront of his arguments the points suggested in the portion of the learned Chief Justice's order quoted above, but in our opinion, there is absolutely no substance in those contentions. The alteration of the conviction from section 299 to section 300, read with section 488 of the Act, was no alteration in the substance of the accusation but only in the section more properly applicable to the facts found. A similar question was raised before their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Begu vs The King Emperor (1). It was argued before their Lordships that the conviction of the appellants before the Judicial Committee under section 201, Indian Penal Code, without a charge under that section, was a serious departure from the procedure laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure. In that case the initial conviction was for murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, but the High Court had set aside that conviction and substituted a conviction under the lesser section 201. After discussing the provisions of sections 236 and 237 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, their Lordships made the following observations which fully cover the present controversy 'A man may be convicted of an offence, although there has been no charge in respect of it, if the evidence is such as to establish a charge that might have been made.' It will be noticed that in the case before the Privy Council, the alteration was not only in respect of the section but also of the substance of the accusation, but as the lesser offence under section 201, had been made out by the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution which was primarily for an offence of murder, their Lordships ruled that sections 236 and 237 of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorize the Court to alter the conviction and the sentence to be passed in respect of the offence made out in the evidence. In the case in hand, it is manifest that the facts sought to be proved and found by the courts below remained the same even after the alteration of the conviction from section 299 to section 300, read with section 488 of the Act. There was, therefore, no illegality in the alteration of the conviction under one section to the other. It was next argued that the notice served upon the appellant was not lawful within the meaning of section 488(1)(c) of the Act, which runs as follows: 488(1) Whoever commits any offence by (a). . . . . . . . . . (b). . . . . . . . . . (c) failing to comply with any direction lawfully given to him or any requisition lawfully made upon him under any of the said sections, sub sections, clauses, provisos or rules, shall be punished. . . . . . .' The substantive portion of the notice is in these terms: 'Take notice that you are hereby required by the Municipal Commissioners of Howrah, within thirty days from the date of service of this notice to remove the encroachment caused by a compound wall measuring 57' 0' x 3' 0' upon Swarnamoyee Road attached to premises No. 10/3 and that in default, the provisions of the above Act will be enforced.' This notice is headed as under section 299 of the Act. It is no more in controversy, as found by the courts below, that the offending part of the structure comes under section 300 which refers to a wall, etc., not being a portion of a building or fixture, as contemplated in section 299. The contention now has narrowed down to this that the notice having been headed as under section 299 of the Act, the conviction under section 300 is illegal, because, it is further argued, the requisition had not been 'lawfully made'. According to this argument, the requisition would have been 'lawfully made', if the notice had been headed as under section 300. Hence, the label given to the notice makes all the difference between a requisition 'lawfully made' and a requisition not so made. In our opinion, this argument has only to be stated to be rejected. It is the substance and not the form of the notice that has to be regarded. The effective part of the notice quoted above, leaves no doubt in the mind of the parties concerned that the requisition is to remove the encroachment caused by the compound wall. As it has not been contended that the appellant had not received the notice, and it is common ground that the appellant had not carried out the terms of the notice, there cannot be the least doubt that the appellant has incurred the penalty under section 488(1)(c), read with section 300. It must, therefore, be held that notwithstanding the label given to the notice, the requisition had been lawfully made in the sense that the appellant had made the encroachment complained of, and that the Municipality was entitled to call upon him to remove the encroachment. The appellant was bound to carry out the terms of the requisition, and as he admittedly failed therein, he had incurred the penalty of the law. It was next sought to be contended that there was substantial prejudice to the appellant inasmuch as if the conviction were under section 299 and not section 300, read with section 488, he may have been entitled to claim compensation. There are several answers to this contention. In the first instance, he himself invited the High Court to interfere with the order of conviction passed by the lower courts. If the High Court has set right the technical defect, as it was bound to do when the matter had been brought to its notice, the appellant has no just grievance, keeping in view the fact that the amount of fine has been reduced as a result of the alteration in the section. Secondly, if he has any rights to claim compensation in a civil court the judgment and order of the criminal court is wholly irrelevant; and thirdly, the prejudice must have reference to any irregularity in the trial of the case. It has not been shown that the appellant had, in any way, been prejudiced in the trial of the case as a result of the alteration in the section, that is to say, that he was deprived of some opportunity to make a proper defence to the prosecution if the right section had been named in the notice or in the charge, if any. Nor has he been able to show that he was misled as a result of any such technical error. Lastly, it was sought to be made out that the prosecution itself was beyond time. This contention was attempted to be made good with reference to the additional evidence adduced at the appellate stage as a result of the direction of the High Court when the case came before it on the first occasion, as mentioned above. In our opinion, there is no substance in this contention because as pointed out by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, the additional evidence placed before the Court puts the matter beyond all reasonable doubt that the complaint had been lodged in time before the relevant authority. In view of these considerations, it must be held that there is no merit in this appeal. It is, accordingly, dismissed. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Appeal No. 209/58. Appeal by special leave from the Award dated September 16, 1957 of the Industrial Tribunal No. 11, Ernakulam, in Industrial Dispute No. 34 of 1957. G. B. Pai and Sardar Bahadur, for the appellants. A. V. Viswanatha Sastri and M. section K. Sastri, for the respondents. March 9. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J. The appellant M/s. Peirce Leslie & Co., Ltd., is a private limited company engaged in various enterprises mainly in South India. It started business in this country over a century ago and though it is registered in England almost all its activities appear to be carried on in this country. The principal activities that require mention are the business in cashew nuts which the Company sells after roasting raw cashew nuts purchased in this country and in Africa, and business in coir products and several other country produce like ginger, lemon grass oil etc. A large portion of the products in which it trades is exported to foreign countries. Apart from these trading activities the company is also engaged in agency business including working as managing agents of many companies. For many years the company as a whole had made good profits, though in some of its many lines, losses were incurred. The company has on its pay roll a large number of employees and apart from superior officers in its covenanted and uncovenanted staff both Indian and European it employs in its various lines of business a large number of workmen including clerical staff. The 196 clerical staff alone consists of 882 monthly paid employees. For many years the Company has voluntarily paid bonus to all its employees out of the surplus profits. To the monthly paid employees with whom we are concerned in the present appeal the company paid during the year 1954-55 a sum equivalent to three months' basic wages as bonus. Not content with this these employees through their Union put forward a claim for additional bonus. The industrial dispute thus raised was referred by the Government to the Industrial Tribunal sitting at Coimbatore. Before the Tribunal the workmen claimed an additional bonus equal to seven months' basic wages. The company's case was that the peculiar nature of its activities specially the fact that in its agency business very little capital was employed and the fact that in the cashew business and other produce business the element of risk was unusually great justify material alteration in the Full Bench Formula for ascertainment of the available surplus in several respects. The main alteration asked for before the Tribunal appears to have been that rates higher than 6% of paid up capital and 4% on reserves employed as working capital should be allowed in working the Full Bench Formula in view of the special risks in its business and the further fact that its agency business requires very little capital. These claims were rejected by the Tribunal. The Tribunal also accepted only partially the company's claims as regards rehabilitation allowances for the year and as regards actual amounts used as working capital. Having arrived on its calculations at the figure of pound 55,137 as the available surplus after meeting all prior and necessary charges the Tribunal awarded bonus equal to five months' basic wages in addition to three months' basic wages already voluntarily paid by the company. In making this distribution the Tribunal rejected the company's case that as this claim was raised by only a small percentage of the workmen the entire available surplus should not be treated as available in distributing bonus to these few workmen. The first contention urged in appeal before us is that the Tribunal was wrong in rejecting the company's claim for higher return than usual on paid up capital and reserves used as working capital. The appellants' counsel has taken us through the evidence, oral and documentary, as regards what he characterized as the heavy fluctuations in the price of raw cashew nuts which the company had to purchase and the price in the foreign market of the finished goods. That there is some amount of risk is undoubtedly true. We are not convinced however that the company's business whether in cashew nuts or in any other line is attended with such unusual risk as would justify the provision of more than the usual rate of return. Return on invested capital has always to provide for pure interest plus compensation for the risks of the business. Prevailing interest in the money market yielded by gilt-edged security is ordinarily taken to be a fair index of what should be considered reasonable as pure interest. For many years now this figure has varied from 3 to 4 per cent. If no risks were involved, this percentage should have been considered a fair return on invested capital. It is because most businesses contain an element of risk-some more some less because of fluctuations, on the one hand in the prices of raw material and on the other hand in the effective demand for the finished goods apart from cyclical booms and depressions that an additional return of 2 to 3% is generally considered necessary to compensate for the risks. It is in view of this that a return of 6% is ordinarily considered to be a fair return on the capital invested in the shape of paid up capital. In a particular industry where the risk is appreciably less than usual there will be good cause for providing less than 6%. And similarly, in an industry where extraordinary risks are run more than 6% should reasonably be provided for. If therefore there was reason to think that the appellant company's contention that its business was attended with unusual risks was correct there would have been good reason to allow a higher rate than 6% on the paid up capital and also a higher rate than 4% on the reserves used as working capital. We are not however satisfied that any such unusual risk is run. There is no more speculation in buying raw nuts and roasting the same and selling them than there is, say, in buying raw cotton in the market, spinning yarn therefrom, making it into cloth and selling such cloth, or in buying raw jute, spinning yarn therefrom weaving it into gunny cloth and selling the same. No case for any higher return on the paid up capital or working capital has been made out by the evidence. Nor can the fact that the agency business of the company does not require much in the way of capital be considered to be a reason for allowing a higher rate of return in those lines. If in the agency businesses considerable profits are earned with a small amount of capital the contribution to such earning by labour including both those at the top and those at the bottom is necessarily considerable. There is no justification for compensating the entrepreneur for the fact that with a small amount of capital considerable profits are earned. This brings us to the appellant's case about higher rehabilitation allowance than what has been allowed by the Tribunal. The company put its claim for rehabilitation allowance at the figure of pound 31,780 but the Tribunal accepted only a sum of pound 9,11,250 as the reasonable figure towards statutory depreciation and rehabilitation together. In support of its claim, the Company produced a number of statements prepared by witnesses claimed to be experts showing the replacement value of buildings, machinery, furniture and sundry plants which constituted the fixed capital of the company. Statements are also produced showing the further expectation of life of each of these items. The services of a chartered accountant firm were also requisitioned and we have on the record a statement showing how the figures required for replacement have been worked out for the various items of buildings, machinery and furniture and sundry plants. According to Exhibit E 50, the statement on which great reliance was place by the company, the total replacement value of its assets was RS. 1,08,02,330 made up of Rs. 77,86,350 for buildings, Rs. 18,52,320 for plants and machinery, Rs. 3,63,550 for furniture and Rs. 8,00,110 for sundry plants. Different items of buildings and machinery are put in separate groups according as the replacement is necessary in view of the residual age, during 1955-60, 1960-65, 1965-70, 1970-75, 1975-80, 1980-85, 1985-90, 1990-95, 1995-2000, 2000-2005. 2005 is taken as the last year, as the residual age is calculated from 1955 and the maximum residual age is taken to be 50 years. Exhibit E 43 shows the detailed calculations on this basis how the sum of Rs. 77,86,335 was arrived at as the replacement cost of buildings. Exhibit E 46 is a similar statement in respect of replacement costs of plant and machinery. Exhibit E 29A shows how after taking reserves for rehabilitation for the different groups of buildings into consideration, the rehabilitation charge for the season 1952-53 is worked out at Rs. 19,878 for buildings and the rehabilitation for plant and machinery is worked out as pound 5,435. Details are also given as regards the calculation of pound 4,744 as the rehabilitation costs to be provided for sundry plants and pound 1,723 as the rehabilitation costs for furniture in the year 1954-55. The very fact that such care has been taken in furnishing details to the Court inclines one prima facie to accept the correctness of these figures without much scrutiny. Scrutiny is however very much needed before the figures and the calculations are accepted. Mention may first be made of the fact that though it was stated by the witness who is responsible for the preparation descargar ppsspp apk gratis android 2025 of the replacement costs of the machinery that he obtained quotations from different firms, no such quotation has been placed on record. That, as the Tribunal itself recognized, affected very much the value of these figures. As however after mentioning the infirmities of the evidence the Tribunal decided to accept as a reasonably accurate statement this figure of Rs. 1,08,02,330 as the total replacement value we need not consider whether we ourselves would have been prepared to accept the evidence if the matter was being considered by us in the first instance. A more serious question however is whether the basis adopted by the appellant's expert for the calculation of this sum as the replacement costs to be provided over the years in the application of the Full Bench Formula can be accepted. As the appellant's expert himself has stated the value he has given as the rehabilitation cost for any particular building is on the basis of what would be required to construct a similar building if the existing building was pulled down in 1955. He has proceeded on the same way as regards the machinery and other assets. The Tribunal after accepting the figure of Rs. 1,08,02,330 as the correct figure for replacement deducted the sum which in its opinion was available in the reserves towards such rehabilitation and then divided the remainder by 50 as 50 years would be the period that these buildings and machinery would last if replaced in 1955 by new buildings and new machinery. It has been urged before us that the Tribunal was wrong in dividing the sum obtained after the total amount to be provided was ascertained by 50 inasmuch as the figure of Rs. 1,08,02,330 was itself arrived at on the basis of the sum that would have to be provided for the different groups of buildings and the sum to be provided in 1954-55 for all these different groups should have been accepted at these figures worked out in Exhibit E 29A. It appears to us that this method of arriving at the rehabilitation costs to be provided in a particular year is not useful and cannot be safely relied upon. To understand the fallacy of the method applied we may briefly state the logic behind the provisions for rehabilitation. Because the fixed capital of any industry is the victim of gradual deterioration the prudent businessman creates reserves out of his profits so that as soon as any portion of the fixed capital has become too deteriorated for efficient working it may be replaced. The economic welfare of the country as a whole no less than the interests of the businessman requires that the company's capital fund should remain intact. It is for this reason that an amount reasonably sufficient for the notional requirement of rehabilitation during the relevant year is deducted as a prior charge in ascertaining surplus profits from which bonus can be paid. The basis of the prior charge is the assumption that rehabilitation is a continuing process and so needs allotment from year to year. That is why it has now been held that if the amount allotted for a specific year is not used, it should be taken into account in the later year. This has been recognized in the Full Bench Formula and has received the authoritative recognition from this Court in numerous cases. A full discussion of the principle involved can be found in Associated Cement Company's Case (1). It is important to note what was pointed out there as regards the replacement value being calculated on the basis of what would be required to replace the fixed assets in question at the date when replacement is due. One way of ascertaining that was to multiply the original cost, by the figure which would reflect the expected rise or fall in prices at the date for replacement. After the replacement cost is ascertained it is necessary to deduct therefrom the amount already lying in reserves for this purpose and then to see over what period the balance will have to be found. There will no doubt be difficulties in the way of estimating the replacement costs in this manner, but that cannot justify the attempt at over simplification by working out the replacement cost on the hypothesis that replacement cost at the date of replacement will be the same as on the present date. If the prices fall in the meantime too much will have been set apart for rehabilitation, if prices rise too little. To take the instance of buildings which form the greater portion of the assets of the appellant company, it may well be that by the time some of these buildings require replacement, the cost of construction will have become less than at the present time by reason of more efficient production of cement and steel in the country. So, also the price of machinery some years later, may well be less than the price now, by reason of such machinery being produced in our own country. The layman's apprehension that prices rise never to fall again cannot be accepted as a correct basis for calculation of the replacement cost on a future date. The entire basis of the calculation of the replacement cost by the appellant's experts is what such costs will be if the building was pulled down or the machinery scrapped in 1955 and had to be replaced by a new machinery on that date. His estimate of the replacement cost cannot therefore be accepted as a sure basis for any calculation of the rehabilitation costs to be provided. It is unnecessary therefore to go into the further question as to whether the Tribunal was justified in treating the sum of pound 20,000/ and also another sum of pound 44,760 as available towards rehabilitation. We may however indicate that if it were necessary to go into the question we would have probably hesitated to hold that these sums were not in fact available for rehabilitation. A strict view of the evidence thus justifies a conclusion that the appellant company has failed to make out any case for rehabilitation allowance in addition to the ordinary depreciation. As however the learned counsel for the respondent did not challenge the correctness of the allowance of pound 11,250 assessed by the Tribunal as the total allowances towards statutory depreciation and rehabilitation together it would be proper to apply the formula on that basis. The other question in dispute was as regards the amount of reserves actually used as working capital. Out of what was claimed by the company as reserves employed as working capital the Tribunal disallowed two items. One was in respect of a sum of pound 2,09,339 which appeared in the balance sheet as provision for taxation liability; another was an item of pound 8,250 as provision for proposed dividend on deferred ordinary shares. The Tribunal was of opinion that the company had not made any attempt to prove that these amounts had actually been used in the business. The appellant contends before us that a scrutiny of the balance sheet is sufficient to satisfy any one that these amounts had actually been employed as working capital. It is stressed in this connection that when the balance sheets were put in evidence through the company's officer no challenge as to the correctness of the statement made therein was made in cross examination. Though no direct challenge to the correctness of the statements appearing in the balance sheets about the value of the different assets appears to have been made it is important to notice that the employer's witness No. 2 through whom the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of the company were put in evidence was asked in cross examination as regards the discrepancy between the statements in the balance sheet E 8 where the bank overdraft was shown as pound 1,95,990 and the statement Exhibit E 12 which showed the bank overdraft in June 1955 as 37.5 lakhs which is equivalent to pound 2,75,000. The difference being of about pound 80,000, the witness was asked which is correct, whether E 8 or E 12 and when the witness answered that both were correct, he was asked 'how'. His answer was 'I do not know'. It may be that there is a satisfactory explanation of this difference but the evidence on record does not disclose this. When there remains prima facie such discrepancy as regards the very important figure as regards bank overdraft the Tribunal would well be justified in refusing to base any conclusion on the valuation of different assets as stated therein. There is apart from this the important fact that the company itself does not claim that whatever appears to be on the asset side over and above the paid up capital has come from the reserves. Exhibit E 30 is the statement prepared by the company's Chartered Accountant to show 'Reconciliation of working capital as on 30th June, 1958.' It arrives at the figure of pound 6,05,564 as the working capital by deducting from the current assets as per balance sheet as on June 30, 1955, six out of nine items under 'Current liabilities & provisions', 3 items not deducted are those under (1) liability for taxation other than U.K. Income tax, (2) proposed dividend on deferred ordinary shares and (3) capital profits on proposed distribution. The obvious reason for deducting the six items from the current assets to arrive at the working capital is that these items in the balance sheets under current liabilities and provision would have to be met during the year out of a portion of the current assets, which portion would accordingly not be available for use as working capital. If that is the case as regards the other items under current liabilities and provisions it is not clear why that should not also be the case as regards the current liabilities under 'liabilities for taxation other than U.K. Income tax' and under 'proposed dividend on deferred ordinary shares'. In the absence of evidence to the contrary there is no ground for thinking that these current liabilities had not also to be met out of the current assets during the year. No such evidence has been produced. The Tribunal is therefore right in our opinion in rejecting the company's claim that these amounts were also employed as working capital. As regards the other prior charges there is no dispute. The Tribunal applying the Full Bench Formula on the basis of the different findings hold after deducting the bonus already paid voluntarily by the company that the company had still in its hand a sum of pound 55,137 out of which it could pay a reasonable amount to these workmen. When deciding how much out of this pound 56,137 could reasonably be paid as additional bonus to these workmen the Tribunal had to consider the contention raised on behalf of the appellant company that it would be unfair to ignore the fact that not these staff members alone but 11,247 other workmen as well have contributed to the emergence of this surplus. The appellant's argument was that staff members who have raised this dispute should not be allowed to steal an advantage over the numerous other workers of the company and that just as results of the different branches of the company have been considered as a whole in arriving at the figure of available surplus it is just and proper that these workmen who have raised the dispute should be given only a fair share out of that portion of the surplus which may be considered properly payable to all the workmen of the company. In dealing with this question the Tribunal has said 'But the fortune of the 11,247 workers depend upon the trading results of the department in which they are working; the bonus of the workers is decided compartment wise and not on the basis of the overall profits of the company. Cashew workers are given bonus on the basis of the cashew department profits and not on the basis of the total profits of the company. The staff members are transferable from one department to another and from one branch to another branch.' We are not able to understand how in spite of the way the company's balance sheets and profit and loss accounts have been kept the different departments of the company could be treated separately for the purposes of bonus. The mere fact that the company has actually done so does not make such distribution right. Obviously if cashew workers would in fact be entitled to a larger bonus on the overall results of the company they have been unfairly treated by the company in having been given lesser bonus on the basis of cashew department profits. It is urged on behalf of the appellant that the fact that the workmen other than these staff members have got less than they would have been entitled to does not justify the grant of a larger share to the present workmen than what they would be entitled to if those other workmen had been given a fair share. This Court had to deal with a somewhat similar position in Indian Hume Pipe Co. vs Their Workmen(1). The respondents there were workmen only of the Wadala factory. The appellant had however paid to various workmen elsewhere as and by way of bonus varying between 4% and 29% of the basic wages for the year in question. It was clear that the sum of Rs. 1,23,138/only had been paid in full and final settlement to the workmen in some of the factories and the bonus calculations on an all India basis would work to the advantage of the appellant, in so far as they would result in saving to the appellant of the difference between the amounts to which those workmen would be entitled to on the basis of the all India figures adopted by the tribunal and the amounts actually paid to them as a result of agreements, conciliation or adjudication. On behalf of the respondents it was therefore contended that the calculations should be made after taking into account the savings thus effected. Dealing with this contention this Court observed: 'We are afraid we cannot accept this contention. If this contention was accepted, the respondents before us would have an advantage over those workmen with whom settlements have been made and would get larger amounts by way of bonus merely by reason of the fact that the appellant had managed to settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures. If this contention of the respondents was pushed to its logical extent, it would also mean that in the event of the non-fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the tribunal in the award of bonus herein bringing in savings in the hands of the appellant, the respondents would be entitled to take advantage of those savings also and should be awarded larger amounts by way of bonus, which would really be the result of the claimants entitled to the same not receiving it under certain circumstances an event which would be purely an extraneous one and unconnected with the contribution of the respondents towards the gross profits earned by the appellant. The tribunal was, therefore, right in calculating the bonus on an all India basis.' Though in the present case there has been no 'settlement' strictly speaking with the other workers in the various branches, the considerations which weighed with the Court in the above case are fully applicable to this case and the Tribunal must be held to have committed an error in treating the sum still in the hands of the company as a matter only between the company and these present claimants. In deciding what relief may reasonably be given to the appellant company in view of this error in the Tribunal's approach to the question of distribution of the amount still available, we have however to take into account two errors which have been made by the Tribunal in this connection in favour of the appellant. One of these is that in distributing the available surplus the Tribunal omitted to take into account the important fact that a sum of no less than pound 1,10,000/ has been capitalised out of the reserves at the beginning of the year. The second error was that the Tribunal in saying that after paying 8 months' bonus there is a balance of pound 34,397 with the employer, omitted to take into consideration the fact that the company would also have the benefit of a large amount as income tax rebate in respect of the bonus paid to its clerical staff. Taking all these facts into consideration we are of opinion that a fair order would be to award to the staff bonus equivalent to 3 months' basic wages in addition to the amount already paid voluntarily. We therefore allow the appeal in part and in modification of the award made by the Industrial Tribunal award to the staff of M/s. Peirce Leslie Co., Ltd., bonus equivalent to 3 months' basic wages in addition to the amount already voluntarily paid by the company. There will be no order as to costs. Appeal partly allowed.",

That under Section 10 of the Bidhan the Karyapalika of the Samiti consisted of 17 members with the following office bearers: (i) Adhyakasha (President) (ii) Karyadhakshya (Working President) (iii) Upadhakshya (Vice President) (iv) Mantri (General Secretary) (v) Koshadhyaksha (Treasurer) (vi) Six members elected by the Byabasthapika Sabha (vii) The Education Secretary to the Government of Assam or a member nominated by him. (viii) Five members of the Byabasthapika Sabha nominated by the Adhyaksha, and (ix) Pradhan Sachib (Chief Secretary) and other departmental secretaries of the Samiti. According to the petitioner the first meeting of this last Byabasthapika Sabha was held on 10.8.82 wherein petitioner No. 2 was elected unanimously as its Mantri (General Secretary) besides other office bearers. According to the Bidhan of the Samiti as it stood in 1982, the Chief Minister of Assam was the Ex Officio Adhyaksha of the Samiti but as at the time of holding of the first meeting the State of Assam was under President's rule, consequently the office of Adhyakasha of the Samiti remained vacant as then there was no Chief Minister of Assam. Petitioner No. 2 and other office bearers of the Karyapalika of the Samiti held the first meeting of the Karyapalika on 19.8.82 and the Karyapalika was running the day to day administration and was managing the affairs of the Samiti according to the Petitioner very efficiently and diligently. It is alleged that in early part of 1983 President's rule was lifted from Assam and a Ministry headed by Shri Hiteswar Saikia was installed in power in Assam. But in the meantime the Samiti in its meeting of the Byabasthapika Sabha held on 17.7.83 passed a resolution for amendment of the provisions of the Bidhan in the following manner: 'That the words contained in Section 16 at page 21 of the Bidhan to the effect that the Chief Minister of Assam shall be the Ex officio Adhyaksha of the Samiti be deleted. All other such references contained in the Bidhan be also accordingly amended. This amendment shall come into force from today the 17.7.83.' That the said resolution was adopted in full compliance of Section 30 of the Bidhan and all members present in the meeting except one supported the resolution. This resolution amending Section 16 of the Bidhan was passed considering the difficulties that arose in the working of the Samiti by keeping Chief Minister as the Adhyaksha of the Samiti. According to the petitioner this amendment was sought necessary to keep the Samiti away from politics. According to the petitioner this amendment was introduced in accordance with Section 30 of the Constitution (Bidhan) of the Samiti which provided: 'The Constitution of the Samiti may be amended as follows: (Ka) The proposal for amendment must reach the head office within the month of January every year. (Kha) The amendment proposals will be sent for information to all the members of the Byabasthapika Sabha from the Office. (Ga) The amendment will be carried out by the 2/3rd members present.' According to the petitioner the procedure stated in this Section of the Constitution was followed and as only one person opposed the Constitution amendment was passed. It is further alleged by the petitioner that as this amendment was passed on 17.7.83 from this date the Chief Minister ceased to be the Ex officio President and since then according to the petitioner he had nothing to do with the Samiti. The post of Ex officio President was abolished. According to the petitioner that Respondent No. 4 after passing of this amendment of the Bidhan on political consideration passed an order dated 7.7.84 contained in the notification No. CMS 202/79/319 dated 7.7.84 whereby respondent No. 4 purportedly to act as the Ex Officio Adhyaksha of the Samiti declared as a state of emergency in the Samiti in exercise of his powers conferred under section 16 (Gha) of the Bidhan and dissolved the existing Karyapalika of the Samiti with immediate effect and also constituted an ad hoc body with himself as Chairman and five others as members to manage the affairs of the Samiti. The petitioner has also filed a copy of this order. It is alleged by the petitioner that under this order petitioners Nos. 1 and 2 were asked to hand over the charges of the management of the Samiti to the Ad hoc Committee. There upon the petitioner filed a suit being a Title Suit No. 110 of 1984 in the Court of the Assistant District Judge No. 1, Gauhati for a declaration that the order dated 7.7.84 passed by Respondent No. 4 declaring a state of emergency and by which he dissolved the existing Karyapalika of the Samiti and constituted an Ad hoc Committee, as void, illegal and without jurisdiction and unenforceable against the petitioner Society. As on the day on which he passed the Order he was no longer the Adhyaksha as the Constitution has been amended before that day. Petitioner also prayed for permanent injunction restraining the respondent No. 4 and other members of the Ad hoc committee, their agents and servants from giving effect to the order. The petitioners also filed an application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the issuance of a temporary injunction. It is alleged that the Assistant District Judge No. 1, Gauhati by his order dated 19.7.84 issued a notice to the defendants of that suit to show cause as to why a temporary injunction as prayed for by the petitioners should not be granted and fixed 13.8.84 as the date for showing cause. The defendants filed their objection on 21.8.84 and the case was fixed on 25.10.84 for consideration of the question of issuing a temporary injunction. When the matter was pending in the Court for consideration of the question of temporary injunction the Governor of Assam purported to act under Clause 1 of Article 230 of the Constitution of India promulgated an Ordinance called the Asom Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti (taking over of Management and Control) Ordinance, 1984 and Section 1 sub clause (ii) of this Ordinance provided that the Ordinance shall extend to all areas over which the Asom Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti had its jurisdiction immediately before the commencement of the Ordinance by a Notification No. EPG 57/84/16 issued under the signatures of Respondent No. 3 the Governor of Assam fixed 1st of October, 1984 as the appointed day on which the aforesaid Ordinance came into force and Section 3 of the said Ordinance provided that the Government may constitute a Board for the purposes of taking over the management and control of the Samiti consisting of not more than 9 members. According to the petitioners this Ordinance was issued at the instance of the Chief Minister which was unnecessary, unwarranted and uncalled for and was against the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court. Notification was issued on 7.7.84, Preamble of which reads as under: 'Whereas the Chief Minister of Assam in his capacity as Ex officio Adhyaksha of the Asom R.B.P. Samiti is satisfied that deterioration of the financial condition of the Samiti has resulted in financial deadlock and the group rivalry among the members, confrontation between the management and the employees culminating in institution of law suits, hunger strikes by employees and chaos in administration matters have resulted in administration deadlock.' The petitioners contended that what is stated in the Preamble is incorrect and misconceived. The financial condition of the Samiti had never deteriorated nor there were any adverse remark by any auditor in the regular auditing of the accounts of the Samiti. It is alleged that even other facts leading to the taking over are wholly incorrect and malicious. Thereafter in 1984 Assam Legislative Assembly passed an Act i.e. Act No. XXIII of 1984 replacing the Ordinance and this Act received the assent of the Governor of Assam on 12.8.84 and was published in the Gazette Extraordinary dated 15.12.84. Under Section 3 of this Act the Assam Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti (taking over of Management and Control) Act, 1984, the number of members constituting the Board was raised to 13. By the provisions of this Act virtually the Samiti which was a public body constituted by its members having elected Byabasthapika Sabha and Karyapalika were substituted by Board appointed by the Government and all the functions, properties and affairs of the Samiti were taken over by this Board and it is this action taken under the Ordinance and the Act and ultimately the Act which is the subject matter of challenge in this Writ Petition. As this infringes the fundamental rights of the members who constitute the Samiti their rights under Article 19(1)(c) and by this process of taking over the Samiti has been deprived of its assets and properties and even as alleged by the petitioners Government has gone to the extent of changing the name of the institution also. It is alleged that after the passing of this Act the notification under section 3 was issued which was EPG 57/34/75 dated 1.10.84 by which the Rashtrabhasha Prachar Board was constituted with respondents 11, 12 and 13 as members and by this order all persons except respondent No. 12 who was not even the member of the Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti were nominated. The petitioners also alleged that in fact all this happened because when the then Chief Minister of Assam learnt about the amendment of the Constitution carried out by Byabasthapika Sabha learnt that under the unamended Bidhan was the Ex officio Adhyaksha has been dropped by the amendment of the Constitution that with mala fide intention he started taking action in a manner in which he could retain the control of the institution. First, he invoked the Constitution itself by superseding the body by invoking emergency provisions but when that was challenged by a suit, an ordinance was brought taking over the Samiti as a whole specially replacing the Byabasthapika Sabha and the Karyapalika and later the ordinance was replaced by the Act and it was contended that this all was the mala fide action of the then Chief Minister of Assam and it is further contended that unfortunately even after the new elections and a new Government comes in power in Assam the Act which as its title discloses was a temporary measure was continued at perpetuity, and the Samiti is being run by nominated members and the rights of the members of the Samiti under Article 19 has not only been restricted but has been taken away. It was also contended that the history of the Samiti and the manner in which it was formed and the persons who initially constituted the Samiti is of significance because its history and historical background touches the ideological and sentimental aspirations of the people of Assam and the infringement of this right to form an association under Article 19(1)(c) is challenged as mala fide action motivated with selfish political motivation. It is also contended that by the operation of this Act those who have nothing to do with the Samiti or its ideals and who were not even the members of the Samiti have been nominated as the members of the Board and they are supposed to run the affairs of the Samiti whereas those who have contributed their heart and soul for the ideals of the Samiti and who have put in long years of hard labour to build up are deprived of their right to manage the affairs of the Samiti. It is also contended that even the assets and the properties of the Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti is being mismanaged by nominated board as it has no moral attachment to the ideals nor aptitude with the work of the Samiti and the assets are being neutralized. It was also contended that the heading of the Act as it disclosed 'An Act to provide for temporary transfer of the management and control of the affairs of A.R.B.P.S. from the Byabasthapika Sabha, Karyapalika and other holders of office of the Assam Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti to a Board'. This heading of the Act, according to the learned counsel, is just an eye wash as this heading shows that a temporary arrangement was made because the management of the Samiti was not in proper hands and the temporary arrangement was only to improve the functioning of the society and ultimately it has to be handed over back to the elected body constituted under the Bidhan (constitution of the society registered under the) but in fact after the passing of this Act in 1984 till today the respondent State had no point of time, even thought of restoring the body to the normal functioning after holding election in accordance with the constitution of the Society. In fact even during the hearing of this Writ Petition the counsel appearing for the State was asked to intimate the Court if even now the State knowing that this was a temporary measure is intending to restore the society back with elected functionaries under the constitution. It was indicated that the Government of Assam has no intentions even now to end this temporary arrangement of the Samiti. It is plain that although the Act talks of a temporary measure but it is only an eye wash and by this process the State Government intends to deprive the members of the society their rights under Article 19(1)(c) for all times to come. In the Act there is no provision providing for restoration of the elected bodies which shows that the use of phrase 'temporary' was just an eye wash. Learned counsel appearing for the State attempted to justify the action however denying that it was not because the constitution was amended and therefore the Chief Minister was annoyed but attempted to suggest that there was some mismanagement of the society but in any event there was no logic which could be suggested for such a permanent taking over of the society registered discharging functions which could not be said to be not ideal and which had started working on some ideals which could not be said 'not for public good'. It is clear that now as the Act of 1984 and a Board nominated or appointed under Section 3 of the Act is controlling the affairs of the Society it is not necessary to go into the orders passed by the Chief Minister invoking the emergency powers although the facts which were alleged clearly go to show that except that constitution was amended and the Chief Minister was dropped from the place which he used to enjoy before the amendment of the Bidhan (Constitution). There was nothing serious and the Chief Minister who in fact had ceased to be an Adhyaksha because of the constitutional amendment took that action only to stick to the position and the subsequent acts even if mala fide action is not clearly established, as was alleged, we have no hesitation in observing that there appears to be no justification as it is clear that if the Act was enacted to meet a temporary contingency for taking over of the management temporarily it could have provided for the restoration of the elected body in due course. It is significant that this Act is silent and although as quoted above it talks of being temporary act, it continues and even as stated above there appears to be no intention of the State Government to restore the body back to the elected bodies under the constitution of the society itself. In these circumstances therefore there appears to be no justification for all these actions starting from invoking the emergency provisions till enacting the present Act i.e. Asom Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti (taking over of the Management and Control) Act, 1984. Except the allegations of mala fide which are not admitted, rest of the facts are not in dispute. The only suggestion made in the counter is that there was mismanagement, delay in examinations and results and it was because of that that management only under this Act was taken over. But neither in the counter nor during the course of arguments anything could be said on behalf of the State for a permanent justification of taking over of the management of the Samiti depriving its members the right under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution of India. In the counter it was contended that the Legislature of the State was competent under Entry 25 of the List III (concurrent list) Schedule 7 of the Constitution to enact this law. Entry 25 List III reads: '25. Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour.' The mere perusal of Entry 25 will reveal as to how difficult it will be to stretch Entry 25 to mean the authority to deprive an association of its right under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution of India. It would have been different situation, if the state felt that it wanted to do the same thing what this Samiti was doing and further the acts of education and for that purpose if it had taken steps to start similar functions at the state level probably the things would have been different. But here we are simply concerned with the taking over of the management of a registered society having large membership and assets and properties following programme and policies living to the ideals which could not be in any way challenged or adversely commented. Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution provides: '19. Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc. (1) All citizens shall have the right (a) xx xx xx (b) xx xx xx (c) to form associations or unions; (d) xx xx xx (e) xx xx xx (f) xx xx xx (g) xx xx xx' The Constitution Bench of this Court had an occasion to consider exactly a similar situation when a Hindi Sahitya Sammelan was taken over first by a State law and later by an Act of Parliament and this Court considering the question in Damyanti Naranga vs The Union of India and Others, observed: 'Further, under Section 7(2) of the Act, the Governing Body of the new Sammelan is to consist of such number of persons, not exceeding 55, as the Central Government may from time to time determine; and out of these, a number not exceeding 7 are to be nominated by the Central Government from among educationists of repute and eminent Hindi scholars. These 7 nominees are to be chosen by the Central Government.' In the present case the Government has taken the power under Section 3 to appoint a Board and the Government can appoint any one not connected with the Society at all to be in the Board. In the Act which was being examined by the Constitution Bench there were some restrictions on the nominations of persons although the persons were to be nominated by the Central Government but in the present Act it is left to the discretion of the Government to appoint the whole of the Board which will take place of not only the Managing Committee i.e. the Karyapalika but also the place of Byabasthapika Sabha which normally used to be an elected body. In this view the observation of the Constitution Bench in Damyanti Naranga's case goes a long way. It is observed in this judgment: 'This is clear interference with the right to form an association which had been exercised by the members of the Society by informing the Society with its Constitution, under which they were members and future members could only come in as a result of their choice by being elected by their working Committee.' It is therefore clear that so far as the present case is concerned it is not only that the new members are introduced, not only that the complete control is left to the Board to be nominated by the Government, about the persons no norms have been laid down, the person so nominated could be anyone and no control is kept to those who formed the Society, those who had a right to form an association will be kept away and the Society shall be run by group of persons nominated by the Government in accordance with Section 3. It is therefore clear that what was done in the Sammelan Acts which were under examination in the Constitution Bench judgment referred to above, much more has been done in this case. In this case virtually the right of association has been taken away and not only that it is a sort of deprivation for all times as it is not even provided that this Board may be an interim Board and thereafter a proper Board will be elected but here this Board will continue to control and manage the affairs of the Society. In the Constitution Bench case their Lordships considered the scope of Article 19(1)(c) in the context of what was contemplated in that Act and observed: 'The right to form an association, in our opinion, necessarily implies that the persons forming the Association have also the right to continue to be associated with only those whom they voluntarily admit in the Association. Any law, by which members are introduced in the voluntary Association without any option being given to the members to keep them out, or any law which takes away the membership of those who have voluntarily joined it, will be a law violating the right to form an association. If we were to accept the submission that the right guaranteed by article 19(1)(c) is confined to the initial stage of forming an Association and does not protect the right to continue the Association with the membership either chosen by the founders or regulated by rules made by the Association itself, the right would be meaningless because, as soon as an Association is formed, a law may be passed interfering with its composition, so that the Association formed may not be able to function at all. The right can be effective only if it is held to include within it the right to continue the Association with its composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the persons forming the association.' It is therefore clear that even on the basis of the pronouncement of the Constitution Bench, the Act and the notification issued under this Act taking over the management of the Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti could not be accepted to be in accordance with the Constitution. Apart from this it is also clear that although when the Act talks of a temporary measure in fact, the Act does not provide for as to how when the temporary measures comes to an end the elected Byabasthapika Sabha and Karyapalika would be restored. It is not only that but it is also apparent that since 1984 when this Act was passed and a notification appointing a Board was issued, the Government has not chosen to take any steps to restore the Society back to its elected authorities and office bearers, inspite of the fact that we indicated and asked the counsel appearing for the State to let us know even if now the State is intending to restore it back to the Society but unfortunately it appears that without considering the question and its constitutional aspects the reply came that the State has no desire to restore the Samiti and therefore we are left with no option but to decide and decide upholding the Constitution and the right of association conferred under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. We therefore allow these writ petitions, set aside the notification issued under the Act enacted by the Assam Legislature holding that the Act itself is ultra vires of the Constitution. We therefore also quash the notification issued under Section 3 of the Act as ultra vires by which a Board was nominated to replace the Karyapalika and Byabasthapika Sabha. At the time when this Board was constituted under Section 3 the Karyapalika and Byabasthapika Sabha duly elected were functioning and they had sufficient time to go on and in this view of the matter we further direct that the Karyapalika and Byabasthapika Sabha which were in existence in 1984 when initially the action under the emergency provisions was taken followed by the notification under the Ordinance and the Act shall be restored back and they shall take over the management of the Samiti from the Board immediately but it is made clear that the Karyapalika and Byabasthapika Sabha which were functioning in 1984 and which we are restoring will within six months from the date of this Order will hold proper elections in accordance with the Constitution to elect a Byabasthapika and Karyapalika. This is necessary because the period of the Karyapalika and Byabasthapika Sabha which was functioning in 1984 has come to an end although from 1984 till today they were not allowed to function. It is further directed that the authorities, officers appointed by the Board or the State Government shall restore back all assets and properties of the Samiti to the Karyapalika which will be restored immediately after the passing of this Order. The petitioners shall also be entitled to costs of this petition. Costs quantified at Rs. 10,000. R.N.J. Petition allowed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeals Nos. 15 and 35 of 1967. Appeals from the judgment and order dated October 12, 1966 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Revision Application No. 289 of 1966. N.S.Bindra, R.M.Parikh and S.P. Nayar, for the appellants (in Cr. A. No. 15 of 1967) and the respondents (in Cr. A. No. 35 of 1967). N.N. Keswani, for the appellants (in Cr. A. No. 35 of 1967) and the respondents (in Cr. A. No. 15 of 1967). K.R. Chaudhuri, for the intervener (in Cr. A. No. 15 of 1967). The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hegde, J. These appeals by certificate arise from the decision of the High Court of Bombay in Criminal Revision Application No. 238 of 1966 wherein the following questions of law arise for decision: (i) Whether the prosecution from which these Criminal Revision Petitions arose is barred under article 20 (2) of the Constitution as against accused Nos. 1 and 2 in that case by reason of the decision of the Collector of Customs in the proceedings under the ? (ii) Whether under any circumstance the finding of the Collector of Customs that the Ist and 2nd accused are not proved to be guilty operated as an issue estoppel in the criminal case against those accused ? (iii) Whether the present prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court in view of inordinate delay in launching the same and consequently whether it is liable to be quashed ? (iv) Whether section 173(4), Criminal Procedure Code is applicable to the facts of this case and (v) Whether the documents mentioned in the petition filed by the 1st accused on August 3, 1965 are required to be summoned under section 94, Criminal Procedure Code ? The aforementioned questions were raised before the trial Magistrate by the 1st accused by means of an application but the learned Magistrate found no substance in the pleas advanced in that application and accordingly he dismissed the same as per his order dated 25,1 1966. In revision, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court agreeing with the trial Magistrate negatived all but one of the contentions advanced on behalf of accused Nos. 1 and 2. It did not agree with the learned Magistrate that there was no need, at that stage to summon the statements of witnesses recorded Customs Act. It directed the learned Magistrate to summon those statements and curiously enough, it went further and directed him to see that the prosecution made available the copies of those statements to the accused before the commencement of the enquiry in the case. In so far as the other documents called for are concerned, the High Court after indicating, what according to it, is the law on the subject left the matter to the discretion of the learned Magistrate. Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 1967 is filed by the Assistant Collector of Customs, Bombay and the State of Maharashtra and Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1967 is the appeal filed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 in the case (Case No. 98 of 1965 in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay). The appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 1967 challenge the correctness of the decision of the Bombay High Court in so far as it went against them and the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1967 challenge that decision in other respects. The prosecution case is that the accused persons and some other unknown persons had entered into a conspiracy at Bombay and other places in the beginning of October, 1959 or India and in pursuance of that conspiracy they had smuggled several items of foreign goods in the years 1959 and 1960. In that connection an enquiry was held by the Customs authorities. In the course of the enquiry some of the goods said to have been smuggled were seized. After the close of the enquiry those goods were ordered to be confiscated. In addition penalty was imposed on some of the accused. Thereafter on February 19, 1965, the Assistant Collector of Customs, Bombay after obtaining the required sanction of the Government filed a complaint against five persons including the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1967 (accused Nos. 1 and 2 in the case) under section 120 B, I.P.C. read with cls. (37), (75), (76) and (81) of section 167 of the (Act VIII of 1878) as well as under section 5 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947. Before the commencement of the enquiry in that complaint, the 1st accused filed on August 3, 1965, the application mentioned above. Now we shall proceed to examine the contentions set out earlier. Reliance on article 20(2) is placed under the following circumstances. In the enquiry held by the Collector of Customs, he gave the benefit of doubt to accused Nos. 1 and 2. This is what he stated therein: 'As regards M/s. Lamel Enterprises (of which accused No. 1 is the proprietor and accused No. 2 is the Manager) although it is apparent that they have directly assisted the importers in their illegal activities and are morally guilty. Since there is no conclusive evidence against them to hold them as persons concerned in the act of unauthorised importation, they escape on a benefit of doubt.' Despite this finding the Assistant Collector in his complaint referred to earlier seeks to prosecute these accused persons. Hence the question is whether that prosecution is barred under article 20(2) of the Constitution which says that no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. This article has no direct bearing on the question at issue. Evidently those accused persons want to spell out from this article the rule of autrefois acquit embodied in section 403, Criminal Procedure Code. Assuming we can do that still it is not possible to hold that a proceeding before the Collector of Customs is a prosecution for an offence. In order to get the benefit of section 403, Criminal Procedure Code or article 20(2), it is necessary for an accused person to establish that he had been tried by a 'court of competent jurisdiction' for an offence and he is convicted or acquitted of that offence and the said conviction or acquittal is in force. If that much is established, it can be contended that he is not liable to be tried again for the same offence nor on the same facts for any other offence for which a different charge from the one made against him might have been made under section 236 or for which he might have been convicted under section 237. It has been repeatedly held by this Court that adjudication before a Collector of Customs is not a 'prosecution' nor the Collector of Customs a 'Court'. In Maqbool Hussain vs The State of Bombay(1), this Court held that the wording of article 20 of the Constitution and the words used therein show that the proceedings therein contemplated are proceedings of the nature of criminal proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal and 'prosecution' in this context would mean an initiation or starting of proceedings of a criminal nature before a court of law or a judicial tribunal in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the statute which creates the offence and regulates the procedure. This Court further held that where a person against whom proceedings had been taken by the Sea Customs authorities under section 167 of the and an order for confiscation of goods had been passed, was subsequently prosecuted before a criminal court for an offence under section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act in respect of the same act, the proceeding before the Sea Customs authorities was not a 'prosecution' and the order for confiscation was not a 'punishment' inflicted by a Court or judicial tribunal within the meaning of article 20(2) of the Constitution and hence his subsequent prosecution was not barred. The said rule was reiterated in Thomas Dana vs State of Punjab(1) and in several other cases. We shall not take up the contention that the finding of the Collector of Customs referred to earlier operated as an issue estoppel in the present prosecution. The issue estoppel rule is but a facet of the doctrine of autrefois acquit. In Sambasivan vs Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya(a), Lord MacDermott enunciated the said rule thus: 'The effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication. The maxim 'Res judicata pro veritate accipitur' is no less applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict and was precluded from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And the appellant was no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it might be relevant in his defence. That it was not conclusive of his innocence on the firearm charge is plain, but it undoubtedly reduced in some degree the weight of the case against him, for at the first trial the facts proved in support of one charge were clearly relevant to the other having regard to the circumstances in which the ammunition and revolver were found and the fact that they fitted each other.' The rule laid down in that decision was adopted by this Court in Pritam Singh vs State of Punjab(a) and again in N.R. Ghose alias Nikhil Ranjan Ghose vs State of West Bengal(4). But before an accused can call into aid the above rule, he must establish that in a previous lawful trial before a competent court, he has secured a verdict of acquittal which verdict is binding on his prosecutor. In the instant case for the reasons already mentioned, we are unable to hold that the proceeding before the Collector of Customs is a criminal trial. From this it follows that the decision of the Collector does not amount to a verdict of acquittal in favour of accused Nos. 1 and 2. This takes us to the contention whether the prosecution must be quashed because of the delay in instituting the same. It is urged on behalf of the accused that because of the delay in launching the same, the present prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court. The High Court has repelled that contention. It has come to the conclusion that the delay in filing the complaint is satisfactorily explained. That apart, it is not the case of the accused that any period of limitation is prescribed for filing the complaint. Hence the court before which the complaint was filed could not have thrown out the same on the sole ground that there has been delay in filing it. The question of delay in filing a complaint may be a circumstance to be taken into consideration in arriving at the final verdict. But by itself it affords no ground for dismissing the complaint. Hence we see no substance in the contention that the prosecution should be quashed on the ground that there was delay in instituting the complaint. We also see no merit in the contention that the accused in this case are entitled to the benefit of section 173(4), Criminal Procedure Code which provides that before the commencement of the enquiry or trial the officer in charge of the police station who forwards a report under section 173, Criminal Procedure Code, should furnish or cause to be furnished to the accused, free of cost, a copy of the report forwarded under section 173(1), Criminal Procedure Code of the first information report recorded under section 154, Criminal Procedure Code and all other documents or relevant extracts thereof on which the prosecution proposes to rely, including the statements and confessions, if any, recorded under section 164, Criminal Procedure Code and the statements recorded under section 161, Criminal Procedure Code of all the persons whom the prosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses. On a plain reading of section 173, Criminal Procedure Code, it is clear that the same is wholly inapplicable to the facts of the present case. In the instant case no report had been sent under section 173, Criminal Procedure Code. Therefore that provision is not attracted. That provision is attracted only in a case investigated by a police officer under Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code, followed up by a final report under section 173, Criminal Procedure Code. It may be remembered that subsection (4) of 173, was incorporated into the Criminal Procedure Code for the first time by Central Act 26 of 1955, presumably because of the changes effected in the mode of trials in cases instituted on police reports. Before the Criminal Procedure Code was amended by Act 26 of 1955, there was no difference in the procedure to be adopted in the cases instituted on police reports and in other cases. Till then in all cases irrespective of the fact whether they were instituted on police reports or on private complaints, the procedure regarding enquiries or trials was identical. In both type of cases, there were two distinct stages i.e. the enquiry stage and the trial stage. When the prosecution witnesses were examined in a case before a charge is framed, it was open to the accused to cross examine them. Hence there was no need for making available to the accused the documents mentioned in subs.(4) of section 173, Criminal Procedure Code. The right given to him under section 162, Criminal Procedure Code was thought to be sufficient to safeguard his interest. But Act 26 of 1955 as mentioned earlier made substantial changes in the procedure to be adopted in the matter of enquiry in cases instituted on police reports. That procedure is now set out in section 251(A), Criminal Procedure Code. This new procedure truncated the enquiry stage. Section 251(A), Criminal Procedure Code says that the Magistrate, if upon consideration of all the documents referred to in section 173 and making such examination if any, of the accused as he thinks necessary and after giving the prosecution and the accused an opportunity of being heard considers the charge against the accused to be groundless he shall discharge him but if he is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence triable as a warrant case which he is competent to try and which in his opinion could be adequately punished by him, he shall frame in writing a charge against him. Under the procedure prescribed in section 251(A), Criminal Procedure Code but for the facility provided to him under s.173(4) of that Code an accused person would have been greatly handicapped in his defence. But in a case instituted on a complaint, like the one before us and governed by sections 252 to 259 of the Criminal Procedure Code, no such difficulty arises. Therein the position is as it was before the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Code in 1955. We are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the High Court that the legislature did not make available the benefit of s.173(4), Criminal Procedure Code in cases instituted otherwise than on police reports by oversight. The observations of the learned Judges in the course of their judgment that 'Even the great Homer occasionally nods. There is nothing to show that the legislature has applied its mind to the question of the amendment of the procedure so far as the investigation of an offence under the is concerned at the time when it was considering amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code' is without any basis. In the first place, it is not proper to assume except on very good grounds that there is any lacuna in any statute or that the legislature has not done its duty properly. Secondly from the history of the legislation to which reference has been made earlier, the reason for introducing section 173(4) is clear. The learned judges of the High Court were constrained to hold that s, 173(4), Criminal Procedure Code in terms does not apply to the present case. But strangely enough that even after coming to the conclusion that provision is inapplicable to the facts of the present case, they have directed the learned Magistrate to require the prosecution to make available to the accused, the copies, of the statements recorded from the prosecution witnesses during the enquiry under the Customs Act. They have purported to make that order under section 94(1), Criminal Procedure Code which to the extent material for our present purpose reads: 'Whenever any Court . . considers that production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any . enquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code by or before such Court . such Court may issue a summons . to the person in whose possession and power such document or thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend and produce it, or to produce it, at the time and place stated in the summons or order.' This section does not empower a Magistrate to direct the prosecution to give copies of any documents to an accused person. That much appears to be plain from the language of that section it was impermissible for the High Court to read into section 94, Criminal Procedure Code the requirements of section 173(4), Criminal Procedure Code. The High Court was not justified, in indirectly applying to cases instituted on private complaints the requirements of section 173(4), Criminal Procedure Code. That apart we do not think that the High Court was justified in interfering with the discretion of the learned Magistrate. Whether a particular document should be summoned or not is essentially in the discretion of the trial court. In the instant case the Special Public Prosecutor had assured the learned trial Magistrate that he would keep in readiness the statements of witnesses recorded by the Customs authorities and shall make available to the defence Counsel the statement of the concerned witness as and when he is examined. In view of that assurance, the learned Magistrate observed in his order: 'The recording of the prosecution evidence is yet commence in this case and at present there are no materials before me to decide whether or not the production of any of the statements and documents named by the accused in his application is desirable or necessary for the purpose of the enquiry or trial. As stated at the outset, the learned Special Prosecutor has given an undertaking that he would produce all the relevant statements and documents at the proper time in the course of the hearing of the case. The request made for the issue of the summons under section 94, Criminal Procedure Code is also omnibus.' The reasons given by the learned Magistrate in support of his order are good reasons. The High Court has not come to the conclusion that the documents in question, if not produced in court are likely to be destroyed or tampered with or the same are not likely to be made available when required. It has proceeded on the erroneous basis that the accused will not have a fair trial unless they are supplied with the copies of those statements even before the enquiry commences. Except for very good reasons, the High Court should not interfere with the discretion conferred on the trial courts in the matter of summoning documents. Such interferences would unnecessarily impede the progress of cases and result in waste of public money and time as has happened in this case. For the reasons mentioned above, we allow Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 1967 and dismiss Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1967. In other words, we restore the order of the learned Magistrate. G.C. Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 1967 allowed. Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1967 dismissed.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 142 of 1956. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 13, 1954, of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India (Calcutta Bench) in Appeal No. Cal 87 of 1953. H. N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor General of India, J. B. Dadachanji, section N. Andley and Rameshwar Nath, for the appellants. P. K. Chatterjee, for the respondents. November 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J. This appeal with special leave arises out of an application made by the appellant to the Industrial Tribunal, Bihar under section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), seeking permission to discharge the respondents from its employ. 873 The respondents were in the employ of the appellant and were staying in a two storeyed house in the city of Patna which had been rented by the appellant for housing its workmen. On November 20, 1952, an occurrence took place in the said house wherein the respondents were involved. Written reports of the said occurrence were sent on November 21, 1952, to the appellant's Chief Engineer and the respondents were placed under suspension the same day. An industrial dispute was then pending between the parties i.e., the appellant and its workmen before the Industrial Tribunal, Bihar, and the appellant therefore made an application to the said Tribunal under section 33 of the Act for permission to dismiss the respondents on the ground of misconduct as per cl. 17(b)(viii) of the appellant's Standing Orders. On November 27, 1952, the respondents also made an application before the said Tribunal under section 33A of the Act inter alia on the ground that their suspension by the appellant as aforesaid was a breach of section 33 of the Act. On December 6, 1952, the appellant made an application before the said Tribunal stating that on a reconsideration of the facts of the case of the respondents the original prayer for permission to dismiss the respondents was not being pressed, and for the ends of justice it would be sufficient if the appellant was granted permission to discharge the respondents under cl. 14(a) of the Standing Orders instead of the original prayer for dismissal under cl. 17(b)(viii) thereof. This application was resisted by the respondents. The Industrial Tribunal, however, entertained the same and after hearing the parties duly made its award on May 14, 1953, dismissing the respondents' application under section 33A of the Act and granting the appellant permission to discharge the respondents from its employ with effect from the date of the order on payment to the respondents of one month's pay in lieu of notice within 15 days therefrom. The respondents carried an appeal against the said order of the Industrial Tribunal granting the appellant's application under section 33 of the Act before the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India, Calcutta. A 874 preliminary objection was taken on behalf of the appellant before the Labour Appellate Tribunal that no substantial question of law was involved and as such the appeal was not maintainable. The Labour Appellate Tribunal was of the opinion that the appellant had alleged misconduct against the respondents and could not be allowed to adopt the expedient of terminating their services by giving notice for the requisite period or payment of salary in lieu of notice and that the Industrial Tribunal, therefore, ought not to have entertained the application for amendment of the prayer of the original application in which the appellant wanted to dismiss the respondents for misconduct. This according to the Labour Appellate Tribunal was a substantial question of law and it therefore entertained the appeal. The Labour Appellate Tribunal thereafter considered whether the appellant had made out a case under cl. 17(b)(viii) of the Standing Orders and came to the conclusion that the respondents had not been guilty of any misconduct within the meaning of that clause and that therefore the order made by the Industrial Tribunal granting permission to the appellant to terminate the services of the respondents was liable to be set aside. In so far, however, as after obtaining the permission from the Industrial Tribunal the appellant had given notice of discharge to the respondents, the Labour Appellate Tribunal expressed its inability to give the respondents any substantial relief either in the shape of reinstatement or compensation. The appellant has come up in appeal before us against this order of the Labour Appellate Tribunal. Shri H. N. Sanyal, appearing for the appellant, has urged in the forefront the contention that no appeal from the order of the Industrial Tribunal lay to the Labour Appellate Tribunal under section 7 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950. He contended that the said order was not a 'decision' within the meaning of that expression in section 7 and even assuming that it was so, the appeal neither involved any substantial question of law nor was it a decision in respect of any of the matters specified in sub section (1)(b) 875 of that section. The answer of Shri P. K. Chatterjee on behalf of the respondents was that the action of the appellant in the matter of the termination of the services of the respondents was punitive in character, that the discharge of the respondents for which permission was sought by the appellant was a punitive discharge, that such discharge was by reason of the alleged misconduct of the respondents falling within cl. 17(b)(viii) of the Standing Orders and not within cl. 14(a) thereof and that the substantial question of law which arose in the appeal was whether the appellant could be allowed to adopt the expedient of terminating the services of the respondents, without going through the procedure of submitting a charge sheet to the respondents and holding a proper enquiry in the matter of those charges, by merely giving notice for the requisite period or payment of salary in lieu of notice and thus resorting to cl. 14(a) of the Standing Orders instead of cl. 17(b)(viii) of the same. The other answer made by Shri P. K. Chatterjee was that having regard to the definition of the term 'retrenchment' to be found in section 2(oo) of the Act the discharge of the respondents by the appellant really amounted to retrenchment and retrenchment being one of the matters specified in sub section (1)(b) of section 7 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950, the respondents had a right of appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal. It is necessary, therefore, to appreciate what was sought to be done by the appellant when it made the application before the Industrial Tribunal on December 6, 1952. This application has been described by the Labour Appellate Tribunal as an application for amendment of the original application which had been filed by the appellant on November 21, 1952, for permission to dismiss the respondents from its employ as per cl. 17(b)(viii) of the Standing Orders. It must be noted, however, that what the appellant purported to do by its application of December 6, 1952, was, in effect, to substitute another application asking for permission to discharge the respondents from its employ under cl. 14(a) of the Standing Orders, thus abandoning the relief which it had prayed for in the original application. The application dated December 6, 1952, was thus, in substance, a new application made by the appellant to the Industrial Tribunal, no doubt relying upon the facts and circumstances which were set out in the original application but asking for the permission of the Industrial Tribunal to discharge the respondents from its employ under cl. 14(a) of the Standing Orders instead of dismissing them from its employ under cl. 17(b)(viii) thereof. We do not see how it was not competent to the Industrial Tribunal to allow the appellant to do so. If the appellant had been actuated by any oblique motives and wanted to evade the consequences of its not having held a proper enquiry, after submitting a charge sheet to the respondents one could have understood the criticism made by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in regard to the same. The Industrial Tribunal, however, expressly recorded the finding that the application for leave to discharge the respondents from its employ was bona fide and what the appellant did by making the application dated December 6, 1952, was actuated by an honest motive of exercising its right to discharge the respondents under cl. 14(a) of the Standing Orders instead of visiting upon the respondents the penalty of dismissing them from its employ under cl. 17(b)(viii) thereof. The discharge of the respondents was a discharge simpliciter in exercise of the rights of the employer under cl. 14(a) of the Standing Orders and was not a punitive discharge under cl. 17(b)(viii) thereof and if it was merely a discharge simpliciter, then, no objection could be taken to the same and the appellant would be well within its rights to do so, provided, however, that it was not arbitrary or capricious but was bona fide. The only question relevant to be considered by the Industrial Tribunal would be that in taking the step which it did the appellant was not guilty of any unfair labour practice or victimization. If the Industrial Tribunal did not come to a conclusion adverse to the appellant on these counts, it would have no jurisdiction to refuse the permission asked for by the appellant. Once the Industrial Tribunal was of opinion that the application dated December 6, 1952, and the discharge of the respondents for which the permission of the Industrial Tribunal was sought were in the honest exercise of the appellant's rights, no question of law, much less a substantial question of law could arise in the appeal filed by the respondents against the decision of the Industrial Tribunal and the Labour Appellate Tribunal was clearly in error when it entertained the appeal. In view of the above finding, we do not propose to deal with the contention that the order passed by the Industrial Tribunal under section 33 of the Act is not a 'decision' within the meaning of that term in section 7 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950. The argument that the discharge of the respondents though patently it was a discharge simpliciter was, in substance, retrenchment within the meaning of the definition contained in section 2(oo) of the Act is equally untenable, for the simple reason that the term 'retrenchment' was for the first time defined in the manner in which it has been done by an Ordinance promulgated in October 1953 which was followed by Act 43 of 1953 which was published in the Gazette of India on December 23, 1953. The Industrial Tribunal made its order granting the permission under section 33 of the Act on May 14, 1953, so that, this definition of the term 'retrenchment' could not apply to the facts of the present case. If, therefore, at the relevant period the discharge simpliciter could not be deemed to be retrenchment of the respondents by the appellant, the decision of the Industrial Tribunal could not be said to be one in respect of any of the matters specified in sub section (1)(b) of section 7 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950. In that view also no appeal could lie from the decision of the Industrial Tribunal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal. It must be observed that neither of these two points was taken by the respondents either in the proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Appellate Tribunal nor was either of them mentioned in the statement of case filed by the respondents in this Court. They were taken for the first time in the arguments advanced before us by Shri P. K. Chatterjee. We have, however, dealt with the same because we thought that we should not deprive the respondents of the benefit of any argument which could possibly be advanced in their favour. We are, therefore, of opinion that no appeal lay from the decision of the Industrial Tribunal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal, that the Labour Appellate Tribunal had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order made by the Industrial Tribunal granting the appellant permission to discharge the respondents under section 33 of the Act and that the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal is liable to be set aside. We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal and restore the order made by the Industrial Tribunal, Bihar, on date May 14, 1953. The appellant will be entitled to its costs of this appeal from the respondents. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Writ Petition (Criminal) Nos. 271 272 of 1982. (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India) Ram Jethmalani and Miss Rani Jethmalani for the Petitioner. R.K. Garg and A.V. Rangam, for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA REDDY, J. Richard Beale and Paul Duncan Zawadzki, two British nationals, said to be friends and collaborators in smuggling enterprises are now under detention under the provisions of the . Richard Beale arrived at Madras from Singapore on December 11, 1981. He brought with him a Mercedez Benz van. On examination by the customs authorities, the van was found to have secret compartments and hidden cavities. It was laced and lined, as it were, with all manner of electronic equipment and goods worth several lakhs of rupees. Richard Beale was interrogated and made a statement. He was arrested and produced before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate of Madras. His friend and collaborator Paul Duncan Zawadzki, who had separately arrived in India and who attempted to contact Richard Beale, was also interrogated, later arrested and produced before the Metropolitan Magistrate. Orders of detention under the COFEPOSA 771 were made against both of them on January 7, 1982 and grounds of detention were duly served on them. The detenus moved the High Court of Tamil Nadu for their release from detention, but their applications were dismissed. They have now come to this Court seeking Writs of Habeas Corpus under article 32 of the Constitution. The two petitions were argued together by Shri Jethmalani and they may be conveniently disposed of by a single order. The first submission of the learned Counsel was that the representation made by the detenus to the Central Government to revoke the orders of detention so long back as March, 1982 remained undisposed of till this day and on that ground alone, the detenus were entitled to be released. Shri Jethmalani drew my attention to section 11 of the COFEPOSA which enables the Central Government to revoke or modify an order of detention made by the State Government or its officers and to the decisions of this Court laying down that delay by the Central Government in dealing with representations of the detenu would also entail the detention invalidating itself. Apart from the fact that there is no proper foundation for the submission, I am not satisfied that there is any merit in the submission. The Writ Petitions were filed on March 12, 1982 and there was then no hint of this submission. The counter affidavit on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu was filed on April 5, 1982. Thereafter, the clerk of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners has sworn to an affidavit mentioning the facts giving rise to the present submission. It appears from the affidavit that when the Prime Minister of India was recently in England, a Bout De Papier was presented to the delegation accompanying her, expressing concern about the detention without trial of Richard Beale and Paul Duncan Zawadzki and suggesting that the detention order might be 'lifted ' and the detenus either released or charged and brought to trial without delay. It further appears that the British High Commission in India also addressed the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, and reminded them about the Bout De Papiere presented to the Prime Minister 's delegation in Britain during her visit to that country. According to Shri Jethmalani, the Bout De Papiere presented to the Prime Minister 's delegation in Britain and the subsequent reminder by the British High Commission constitute a representation to the Central Government demanding their immediate consideration in terms of the provisions of the COFEPOSA. I have no doubt that the Bout De Papier and the reminder, diplomatic 772 communications that they are between the Governments of the two countries, will be attended to and answered through appropriate diplomatic channels in proper time and with necessary expedition. But I find it difficult to treat such diplomatic communications between one country and another as representations to the statutory authorities functioning under the COFEPOSA, as representations which require immediate consideration by the statutory authorities and which if not considered immediately, would entitle the detenus to be set at liberty. Nor is it possible to treat the countless petitions, memorials and representations which are everywhere presented to the Prime Minister and other Ministers as statutory appeals or petitions, statutorily obliging them to consider and dispose of such appeals and petitions in the manner provided by statute. No doubt the Prime Minister and other Ministers, as leaders in whom the people have reposed faith and confidence, will deal with such appeals and petitions with due and deserved despatch. But quite obviously that will not be because they are discharging statutory obligations. It is not also possible to treat representations from whatever source addressed to whomsoever officer of one or other department of the Government as a representation to the Government requiring the appropriate authority under the COFEPOSA to consider the matter. I do not consider that the Bout de Papiere presented to the Prime Minister during her visit to Britain and the subsequent reminder addressed to the External Affairs Ministry by the British High Commission are representations to the Central Government which are required to be dealt with in the manner provided by the COFEPOSA. It was next submitted by the learned Counsel that the Chief Minister, who according to the Rules of Business of the Government of Tamil Nadu, was required to deal with matters relating to preventive detention neither applied his mind to the making of the orders of detention, nor considered the representation of the detenus himself. The relevant files have been produced by the learned Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu and on perusing them, I find no substance in the submission of the learned Counsel. The submission which was most strenuously urged by the learned counsel was that the detenus had been denied the right to 773 be represented before the Advisory Board by an Advocate or at least by a friend and that they were thus denied the right to make a proper and effective representation to the Advisory Board. This was sufficient, said the learned Counsel, to vitiate the detention. The learned Counsel urged that the detenus were foreign nationals and they were under a handicap being ignorant of the laws and procedures of this country. To deny legal representation to them was an unreasonable exercise of the discretion vested in the Advisory Board to permit or not to permit legal representation. According to the learned Counsel, this was a clear case where legal representation should have been permitted. In any case, it was urged, the detenus ought to have been offered at least 'friendly ' representation, if not legal representation. Reliance was placed upon the following observations of the Constitution Bench in A.K. Roy vs Union of India : 'Another aspect of this matter which needs to be mentioned is that the embargo on the appearance of legal practitioners should not be extended so as to prevent the detenu from being aided or assisted by a friend who, in truth and substance, is not a legal practitioner. Every person whose interests are adversely affected as a result of the proceedings which have a serious import, is entitled to be heard in those proceedings and be assisted by a friend. A detenu, taken straight from his cell to the Board 's room, may lack the ease and composition to present his point of view. He may be "tongue tied, nervous, confused or wanting in intelligence" (see Pett vs Greyhound Racing Association Ltd., , and if justice is to be done, he must at least have the help of a friend who can assist him to give coherence to his stray and wandering ideas. Incarceration makes a man and his thoughts dishevelled. Just as a person who is dumb is entitled, as he must, to be represented by a person who has speech, even so, a person who finds himself unable to present his own case is entitled to take the aid and advice of a person who is better situated to appreciate the facts of the case and the language of the law. It may be that denial of legal representation is not denial of natural justice 774 per se, and, therefore, if a statute excludes that facility expressly, it would not be open to the Tribunal to allow it. Fairness, as said by Lord Denning M.R., in Maynard vs Osmond , 253, can be obtained without legal representation. But, it is not fair, and the statute does not exclude that right, that the detenu should not even be allowed to take the aid of a friend. Whenever demanded, the Advisory Boards must grant that facility.' In the present case, the Advisory Board consisting of three Judges of the High Court of Tamil Nadu considered it unnecessary and inadvisable to allow legal representation to the detenus. It was a matter for the decision of the Advisory Board and I do not think I will be justified in substituting my judgment in the place of their judgment. The detenus were heard personally by the Advisory Board. After seeing and hearing them personally also, the Board did not feel it necessary to provide legal representation to them which they would certainly have done if they had thought that the detenus appeared to require such representation. Regarding representation by a friend, there was never any such demand by the detenus. A 'friendly ' representation would certainly have been provided if it had been so demanded. It was not for the Advisory Board to offer 'friendly ' representation to the detenus even if the latter did not ask for it. Relying upon a sentence in the counter Affidavit of Shri Thiru Bhaskaran that representation not only by a lawyer, but by a friend was also considered not necessary by the Advisory Board, it was argued that the Advisory Board had, without warrant, refused even friendly representation. Shri Thiru Bhaskaran was speaking for the State of Tamil Nadu and not for the Advisory Board. I have perused the file of the Advisory Board which was produced before me and I have also perused the communications addressed by the Advisory Board to the Government of Tamil Nadu and to the detenus. I do not find the slightest hint of a demand for 'friendly ' representation or its denial anywhere. The Advisory Board was neither asked nor did the Board deny any 'friendly ' representation. A charge was made against the Advisory Board that there was inequality of treatment. It was said that while the detaining authority was allowed to be represented by its officers and advisers, the detenus were allowed no representation. There is no substance 775 in this charge. From the affidavit of the Chairman of the Advisory Board, I find that all that happened was that some customs officers were allowed to be present in the corridor so as to enable them to produce the relevant files whenever required for perusal by the Board. The charge of inequality of treatment is, therefore, baseless. Yet another submission of the learned Counsel was that the Advisory Board failed to consider the question whether the detention continued to be justified on the date of the report of the Advisory Board, even if it was justified on the date of the making of the order of detention. The order of detention was made on 7.1.82 and the consideration by the Advisory Board was on 8.2.82. The passage of time was not so long nor had any circumstances intervened to justify any compartment wise consideration of the justification for the detention on the date of the making of the order of detention and on the date of the report of the Advisory Board. In the circumstances of the case, I think that the report of the Advisory Board that there was sufficient cause for the detention of Richard Beale and Paul Duncan Zawadzki necessarily implied that the detention was found by the Board to be justified on the date of its report as also on the date of the making of the order of detention. A complaint was also made that the Advisory Board carried on its correspondence with the detenus through the Government. This, it was stated, gave rise to a suspicion that everything was done by the Board at the behest or in consultation with the Government. This complaint is wholly unjustified. As already mentioned by me, the Advisory Board consisted of three Judges of the High Court of Tamil Nadu and as explained by the Chairman in his Affidavit, the correspondence etc. is carried on through the Government because the Board has no separate administrative office of its own. All the points urged on behalf of the detenus fail and the petitions are, therefore, dismissed. N.V.K. Petitions dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 1135 of 1981. From the Judgment and Order dated 15.12.1980 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Writ Petition No. 1096 of 1974. R.N. Trivedi, R. Ramachandran and Ms. Sadhna Ramachandran (N.P.) for the Appellant. Anil Deo Singh, Gopal Subramanium, Ms. section Dikshit, S.S. Hussain, S.A. Syed, R.S.M. Verma and Shakil Ahmed Syed for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KULDIP SINGH, J. Karamat Husain Muslim Girls College, Lucknow (hereinafter called the 'College ') is being managed by Anjuman Muslimat e Hind which is a society registered under the . The avowed object of the society is to advance the cause of education among the women of India. The College has been recognised by the State of Uttar Pradesh as a religious minority institution within the meaning of Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India and is an affiliated associate of Lucknow University. The post of lady Principal in the degree section of the college was advertised on April 5, 1974 indicating the following qualifications/ requirements: (1) First or good second class Masters Degree in any of the subject taught in the institution; (2) At least five years experience of teaching degree classes as also administrative experience; (3) Must possess working knowledge of Urdu; (4) Willing to reside in the college premises. In response to the advertisement the appellant along with others applied for the post. The appellant did not fulfil the qualification of five years experience. She alone appeared for the interview and the Selection Committee relaxed the qualification of experience in her favour and selected her. The Management thereafter sought the approval of the University to appoint the appellant as required under Section 31(11) of the Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973 (hereinafter called the 'Act '). The University, however, declined to approve and directed the management to re advertise the post. The appellant challenged the decision of the University by way of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on the ground that the college being a minority institution any interference by the University under the Act is violative of Article 30(1) of the Constitution. It was also contended that there was no basis or justification to withhold the approval. The High Court rejected the attack on the ground of Article 30 of the Constitution of India by holding that the provisions of the Act are regulatory and are primarily for the purpose of maintaining uniformity, efficiency and standards of education in the minority institutions. On the merits the High Court held that the Selection Committee was not justified in relaxing the qualification without reserving that right to itself in the advertisement. The High Court also found that the qualification 'possessing working knowledge of Urdu' was unjust On the above findings the writ petition was dismissed. This is how the appellant is before us via Article 136 of the Constitution of India. The High Court has rightly held the relaxation granted by the Selection Committee to be arbitrary. In the absence of statutory rules providing power of relaxation, the advertisement must indicate that the Selection Committee/Appointing Authority has the power to relax the qualifications. Regarding 'Working knowledge of Urdu' we do not agree with the High Court that the said qualification is unjust. The college being a Muslim minority institution prescribing the said qualification for the post of Principal, is in conformity with the object of establishing the institution. In the view which we are taking in this case it is not necessary to go into the argument based on Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India. We heard the arguments in this case on February 23, 1990 and adjourned the case with the following order: 'It is admitted by the parties that as a result of the Court orders the appellant Ms. Shainda Hasan is continuing to work as Principal in the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls College, Lucknow since 1974. Having served the institution for over 16 years it would be unjust to make her leave the post. Under the circumstances let the University reconsider the whole matter sympathetically.' The case was taken up in Chambers on April 20, 1990 when Mrs. Shobha Dixit learned counsel for the State after obtaining instructions from the University agreed with us that asking the appellant to leave the job after sixteen years would be doing injustice to her. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice we direct the Lucknow University and its Vice Chancellor to grant the necessary approval to the appointment of the appellant as Principal of Karamat Husain Muslim Girls College, Lucknow, with effect from the date she is holding the said post. We further direct that the appellant shall be entitled to the salary, allowances and all other consequential benefits to which a regular principal of the said college would have been and is entitled. We dispose of the appeal with the above directions. There shall be no order as to costs. T.N.A. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 162 of 1965. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 8, 1965 of the Gujarat High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 345 of 1964. Urmila Kapur and section P. Nayar, for the appellant. The respondent did not appear. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hidayatullah C.J. This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Gujarat, January 8, 1965, by which an order confiscating 1500 and odd bottles said to contain intoxicating liquor by the City Magistrate, 8th Court, Ahmedabad, has been set aside. The facts of the case are as follows. On January 9, 1963, Sub Inspector, Benot of Ahmedabad City raided a godown consisting of two rooms in Serial No. 151010 and Survey No. 324/0. He found several deal boxes which were opened and each box was found to contain 144 bottles packed with grass, each bottle containing 4 oz. of some liquid. Bottles were of two kinds, one containing yellow liquid and the other a red liquid. The bottles containing Yellow liquid were labeled 'U. D. Colon Solvek Cosmetics Bombay, 28. , and the bottles containing red liquid were labeled 'Jasmine Batch No. 3. Solvek Cosmetics Bombay. From these bottles, two bottles, one of each kind, were selected and were sent to the Chemical Examiner, Baroda for test. Before sending them, the Panchas were allowed to seal the bottles with paper slips containing the signature of panchas pasted on them for identification. On analysis, they were found to contain alcohol and the respondent Chinubhai Gopaldas was prosecuted under section 66(b) of the Bombay Prohibition Act. The other bottles numbering 1584 containing 6336 oz. of alleged alcohol were kept intact. Gopal Das 's prosecution failed. He was, acquitted by the City Magistrate, because according to him, it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was in possession of these bottles on his own. It was found 'that he possessed them as agents of a wholesale merchant. It is in evidence however that he did not possess a permit or licence for possessing alcohol. The Magistrate while acquitting him ordered the confiscation of the remaining bottles under section 98 of the Prohibition Act. The State Government did not appeal against the acquittal. Gopaldas went to the High Court 'in appeal against the order of confiscation. The learned Single Judge of the High Court ordered return of the bottles, because according to him it was not proved that the 1500 and odd other bottles also contained intoxicants. He therefore held that the confiscation of the bottles was illegal as no order under section 98 of the Bombay Prohibition Act could be passed. In this appeal by the State of Gujarat it is contended that section 98 applies to the case. That section reads as follows : 'Whenever any offence punishable under this Act has been committed, (a) any intoxicant, hemp, shora, flowers, molasses, materials. still, utensil, implement or apparatus in respect of which the offence has been committed, shall be confiscated by the order of the Court.' The short question therefore is whether it can be said that in respect of the 1500 and odd bottles, an offence punishable under the Prohibition Act had been committed. It is no doubt true that the person who was charged with committing an offence was found not guilty, but the question is not whether the accused has been successfully brought to book, but whether the offence in respect of the property has been committed or not. There is distinction between the two. An offence may be demonstrated to be committed although the accused who committed it may not be successfully prosecuted. We may give an example. Suppose in a house a vast quantity of contraband opium is found. The householder may get off because the opium was found from a place which was open and had access to strangers. He may get the benefit of doubt and be acquitted, but it is clear that in so far as the opium is concerned, an offence must be deemed to have been committed, and if it is proved that , the contraband article was opium, it would be remarkable that the order should be that the opium be returned to the householder. In these circumstances, on proof that the contraband article in respect of which an offence has been committed is proved to exist, the obvious course would be to confiscate it to the State. In the present case, the two bottles which were sent to the Chemical Examiner were said to contain alcohol although there was some doubt in the mind of the Magistrate as to whether there was no chance of any malpractice. Be that as it may, there are the other bottles intact. There is some evidence to show that they were in the original packing and were a proprietary product. The manufacturer came as a witness and deposed that the liquids were bottled by him as a proprietary manufacture. In these circumstances, it would be fair to assume that all of them were of the same kind as the ones which were sent for chemical examination. However an examination of random samples can be made and if they satisfy the court that the bottles contain contraband articles the bottles can be confiscated. The order of the High Court is thus set aside, but instead of restoring the order of confiscation we order that a few bottles at random should be, analysed and if contraband stuff against the Prohibition Act is found the whole stock shall be confiscated. The appeal is allowed and the case is remanded as ordered. G.C. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "N: Criminal Appeal No. 249 of 1976. Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and order dated the 10th July, 1975 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Misc. No 1104 of 1975. Prithvi Raj and Dalveer Bhandari for the Appellant. N.M. Ghatate for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DESAI, J. : Respondents Lakshmi Brahman and Naval Garg were suspected of having committed an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life under section 302 IPC. Both of them surrendered before the Magistrate on November 2, 1974 and were taken into custody. The investigation was then in progress. The investigating officer failed to submit the charge sheet against 540 them within a period of 60 days as contemplated by sub sec 2 of sec. 167 of 1973 Code prior to its amendment by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1978 which enlarges the period from 60 to 90 days where the investigation relates to an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years. In this case we are concerned with the proviso to sec. 167 (2) of the Cr. P. C. 1973 prior to its amendment in 1978. It appears that the Investigating officer failed to submit the charge sheet within the prescribed period and according to the High Court till as late as February 5, 1975. Thereupon the two respondents moved an application under sec. 439 of the Cr. P. C. invoking the power of the High Court to grant bail to any person accused of an offence, even where the offence is punishable with death or imprisonment for life. A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court which heard the application was of the opinion that after the charge sheet has been submitted under sec. 170 Cr. P. C., the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to authorise the detention of an accused in custody under sec. 167 Cr. P. C., and therefore, the authority to remand the accused to custody after the charge sheet has been submitted, has to be gathered from other provisions of the Code. The High Court then posed to itself the question whether in a case instituted upon a police report exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, the Magistrate while committing the accused to the Court of Sessions, under sec. 209 Cr. P. C. has, after the accused is brought before him and before the order committing the accused to the Court of Sessions is made, jurisdiction to remand the accused to custody other than the police custody ? The High Court was of opinion that since after the enactment of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the proceeding before the Magistrate under Chapter XVI of the Code would not be an enquiry within the meaning of the expression in sec. 2 (g) and, therefore, sec.209 would not confer power on the Magistrate to commit the accused to custody. Proceeding along the line, the High Court held that in view of the provision contained in sec. 207 read with sec. 209 of the Cr. P. C. the Magistrate has to commit the accused forthwith to the Court of Sessions and only after the order of commitment is made, the Magistrate will have power to remand accused to the custody during and until the conclusion of the trial. Tho High Court according held that the Magistrate has no 541 jurisdiction, power or authority to remand the accused to custody after the charge sheet is submitted and before the commitment order is made, and therefore the accused were entitled to be released on bail. So saying, the High Court directed that the respondents be released on bail pending the trial by the Court of Sessions. State of U.P. has preferred this appeal by special leave. Respondents have not appeared even though served and the notice of lodgment of appeal has also been served upon them. As the respondents had not entered appearance, a fresh notice of hearing the appeal was also issued, but the respondents have not chosen to appear at the hearing of the appeal. Mr. Prithviraj, learned counsel appeared for the appellant, State of U.P. At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, we enquired from him as to what has happened to the case against the respondents, whether the trial had taken place; whether they were acquitted or convicted and whether any useful purpose would be served by hearing of the appeal which appears to us to have become practically infructuous. Mr. Prithviraj had no information about the stage of trial and the present position of the respondents. But it was urged that the interpretation put by the High Court on secs. 207, 209 and 309 if not examined by this Court is likely to result in miscarriage of justice in a large number of cases as the High Court has introduced a stage of compulsory grant of bail to persons accused of serious offence not warranted by the Code, and who would not be otherwise entitled to the discretionary relief of bail. It is this submission which has persuaded us to examine the contention on merits. Section 2(g) of the Code defines inquiry to mean every inquiry, other than a trial, conducted under the Code by a Magistrate or Court. Cognizable offence has been defined in sec, 2(c) to mean an offence for which, a police officer may, in accordance with the First Schedule or under any other law for the time in force, arrest without warrant. 57 provides that no police officer shall detain in custody a person arrested without warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable and such period shall not, in the absence of a special order of a Magistrate under Sec. 167, exceed twenty four hours, exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate 's Court. In fact, the provision contained in sec, 57 incorporates the fundamental right guaranteed by article 22 of the 542 Constitution. Chapter XII of the Code incorporates provisions for initiation of investigation on receipt of information of a cognizable offence continuing the investigation culminating in the submission of a police report otherwise styled as charge sheet under sec. 170 to the Magistrate having jurisdiction, which would imply the end of investigation. Subsequent proceeding before the Magistrate would be the commencement of inquiry or trial leading to either commitment for trial in the Session Court or to discharge or acquittal of the accused by the Court having jurisdiction to try the case. 167 finds its place in Chapter XII. Prior to its amendment by the amending Act of 1978, it read as under: '(1) Whenever any person is arrested and detained in custody, and it appears that the investigation cannot be completed within the period of twenty four hours fixed by sec. 57, and there are grounds for believing that the accusation or information is well founded, the officer in charge of the police station or the police officer making the investigation, if he is not below the rank of sub inspector, shall forthwith transmit to the nearest Judicial Magistrate a copy of the entries in the diary hereinafter prescribed relating to the case, and shall at the same time forward the accused to such Magistrate. (2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded under this section may, whether he has or has not jurisdiction to try the case, from time to time authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the whole; and if he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, and considers further detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to be forwarded to Magistrate having such jurisdiction: Provided that: (a) the Magistrate may authorise detention of the accused person, otherwise than in custody of the police, beyond the period of fifteen days if he is satisfied, that adequate grounds exist for doing so, but, no Magistrate shall authorise the detention of the accused person in custody under this section for a total period exceeding sixty days, and on the 543 expiry of the said period of sixty days, the accused person shall be released on bail; and every person released on bail under this section shall be deemed to be so released under the provisions of Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of the Chapter; (b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention in any custody under this section unless the accused is produced before him; (c) no Magistrate of the second class, not specially empowered in this behalf by the High Court, shall authorise detention in the custody of the police.' In this appeal, we are concerned with sec. 167 hereinabove extracted. The High Court after examining the scheme of sec. 167(1) and (2) with the Proviso rightly concluded that, on the expiry of 60 days from the date of the arrest of the accused, his further detention does not become ipso facto illegal or void, but if the charge sheet is not submitted within the period of 60 days, then notwithstanding to the contrary in sec. 437(1), the accused would be entitled to an order for being released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail. In this case, it is an admitted position that the respondents did not apply to the Magistrate for being released on bail on the expiry of 60 days from the date of their arrest. The High Court was of the opinion that as the respondents did not apply for bail on the expiry of sixty days from the date of their arrest, their continued detention would not be illegal or without the authority of law. So far there is no controversy. It was next contended before the High Court that after the submission of the charge sheet, when the investigation could be said to have ended, it was not open to the Magistrate to authorise the detention of an accused in custody under sec. 167 of the Code, and therefore, if the accused is to be detained in custody after the submission of the charge sheet upon which the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence, the power to remand the accused to custody will have to be gathered from other provisions of the Code. The High Court then took notice of the fact that the police report discloses an offence exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions and the Magistrate will have to proceed according to the provision contained in sec. 209 of the Code. Shorn of embellishment the High Court proceeded to find out how the accused against whom the allegation is that he is 544 suspected of having committed an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life and in respect of whom the period for completion of investigation has elapsed and in the absence of charge sheet, order committing him to Court of Sessions to stand his trial cannot be made and the accused does not apply for bail, how is he to be dealt with by the Magistrate. In other words during the interregnum, has the Magistrate power or jurisdiction to remand him to custody other than police custody and if there is such power, in which provision it is located. The High Court then combed other provisions of the Code, and, ultimately, concluded that since the 1973 Code does not envisage a preliminary enquiry to be held by the Magistrate under Chapter XVI, the Magistrate is not expected to hold any enquiry before committing the accused and therefore sec. 309, would not enable him to remand the accused to custody. In the terms High Court held that in such a situation for want of power in the Magistrate to remand accused to custody, the Magistrate must forthwith on receipt of charge sheet pass an order committing the accused to Court of Sessions to stand his trial and then exercise power under sec. 309 or to release him on bail notwithstanding the fact that accused has not sought an order of bail. The High Court left the question unanswered what would happen if the accused is unable to furnish bail by suggesting that the best thing to do for the Magistrate in such a situation is to forthwith pass an order committing the accused to Sessions to stand his trail and then invoke his jurisdiction to remand the accused to custody under sec. 309 of the Code. The High Court held that as the Magistrate before whom the charge sheet was submitted remanded the respondents to custody without making the order of commitment, the order remanding the accused to custody, cannot be sustained under secs. 167 (2), 209, 309 of the Code, and no other provision under which the respondents could be remanded to the custody at that stage having been indicated to the Court, the High Court considered it a compelling necessity to accede to the request of the respondents to direct that they should be released on bail. Serious exception is taken to this view of the High Court by the learned counsel for the appellant. Respondents were suspected of having committed an offence punishable under sec. 302 IPC. On their having surrendered, they were taken into custody. When the matter was before the High Court as noticed by the High Court, the charge sheet was not submitted against them by the Investigating Officer meaning thereby that 545 investigation was still in progress. The High Court proceeded to examine the powers of the Magistrate to whom the charge sheet is submitted, in case of an offence exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions for dealing with an accused after he is produced before him presumably under sec. 170 and before an order committing the accused to the Court of Sessions as envisaged under sec. 209 is made. If the High Court had no information when the application for bail moved by respondents for being enlarged on bail was heard as to whether the charge sheet against respondents was submitted to the Magistrate or not, in our opinion, it was futile for the High Court to undertake investigation of a point of law which would not directly arise in the facts before the High Court and ordinarily the academic exercise is hardly undertaken. However, now as the High Court has dealt with the matter it becomes a precedent and, therefore, it becomes necessary for us to examine whether the view of the High Court is in consonance with the provision of the Code. And if not whether in the larger interest of criminal justice, it is necessary to interfere with the same. We would proceed on the assumption as done by the High Court that the Investigating Officer has submitted the police report as contemplated by sec. 170 and as required therein forwarded the accused under custody to the Magistrate to whom the police report is submitted. Now, the High Court is right in holding that the jurisdiction to grant bail, in case investigation is not completed within the prescribed time limit as incorporated in the provision as it then stood, vests in the Magistrate if the accused applies and is prepared to furnish bail. Section 167 envisages a stage when a suspect is arrested and the investigation is not completed within the prescribed period. The investigation would come to an end the moment charge sheet is submitted as required under sec. 170 unless the Magistrate directs further investigation. This view is in accord with the decision of this Court in State of Bihar Anr. vs I.A.C. Saldanha & Ors. (1) The question is how the Magistrate is to deal with the accused forwarded to him with the police report under sec. 170 and the police report disclose an offence exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions. Provisions contained in Chapter XVI provide for commencement of proceedings before the Magistrate. But before we refer to 546 those provisions, w must make a passing reference to the provision contained in sec. 190 which provides for taking cognizance of any offence by Magistrate, one such mode of taking cognizance of an offence being upon police report if the facts disclose an offence. The police report contemplated by sec. 190(1)(b) is the one submitted to the Magistrate under sec. provides for issue of process. 207 provides that in any case where the proceeding has been instituted on a police report, the Magistrate shall without delay furnish to the accused, free of costs, a copy of each of the documents set out therein. There are two provisos to this section which are not material for the present purpose. 209 confers power on the Magistrate to commit the accused to the Court of Sessions when the offence disclosed in the police report is triable exclusively by it. Section 209 reads as under: '209. Commitment of case to Court of Sessions when offence is triable exclusively by it; When in a case instituted on a police report or otherwise the accused appears or is brought before the Magistrate and it appears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, he shall (a) commit the case to Court of Sessions; (b) subject to the provisions of this Code, relating to bail, remand the accused to custody during, and until the conclusion of the trial;. ' The High Court was of the opinion that on the submission of the police report under sec. 170, the Magistrate has to forthwith commit the accused to the Court of Sessions if the offence disclosed in the charge sheet is the one exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions. This being the only function of the Magistrate according to the High Court, the proceeding before the Magistrate under sec. 207 read with sec. 209 would not be an inquiry within the meaning of the expression in sec. 2(g) of the Code. In reaching this conclusion, the High Court referred to secs. 84, 116, 125, 137, 138, 145 and 146 as well as secs. 159 and 202 of the Code to ascertain the meaning of expression 'inquiry ' in the context in which it is used in these provisions. These provisions would hardly shed any light on the nature of the proceedings and the function discharged by the Magistrate from the time of receipt of a police report 547 under sec. 170 disclosing an offence exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions and until making of an order committing the accused to the Court of Sessions to stand his trial. The question posed is: is it an administrative function or it is a judicial function ? It is certainly not an administration function. If it is judicial function, it has to be either an inquiry or a trial because the Code does not envisage discharge of judicial function by the Magistrate under the Code in any other manner. The High Court in this context has observed as under: 'These sections (207 209) do not contemplate that before committing the case to Sessions, the Magistrate should conduct some proceeding with a view to ascertain or verify facts. 209 of the Code merely required the Magistrate, taking cognizance of an offence on the basis of a police report, to look into the report and if he finds that the case is triable exclusively by Court of Sessions to make an order committing the case to Sessions. Since in such a case the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence is not required to conduct any proceeding for ascertaining or verifying facts with a view to commit the case to Sessions, it cannot be said that the provisions contained in secs. 204, 207 to 209 of the Code contemplate an inquiry under the Code. ' With respect this approach is not only not borne out by the relevant provisions of the Code but it overlooks the scheme of the sections and the purpose underlying the same. Section 170 obligates the Investigating Officer to submit the police report if in the course of investigation sufficient evidence or reasonable ground is made out for the trial or for commitment of the accused, to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of an offence upon a police report. On this report being submitted the Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence disclosed in investigation as envisaged by sec. 190. It is indisputable that taking cognizance of an offence under sec. 190 is a purely judicial function subject to judicial review by court of appeal or revision to which the Magistrate is subject. Cognizance of an offence even if exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions has to be taken by the Magistrate because section 193 precludes it from taking cognizance 548 of any offence when it provides that no Court of Sessions shall take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the accused has been committed by the Magistrate under the Code. Thus even in case of an offence exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, the police report on completion of investigation has to be submitted to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to commit the accused for trial. It is the Magistrate who takes cognizance of the offence and not the Court of Sessions though the case is one exclusively triable by the latter. Sec. 170 directs that if the accused in respect of whom police report is being submitted is in police custody, he has to be forwarded alongwith the police report to the Magistrate. When the Magistrate receives the report and the accused is produced before him it is necessary for him to pass some order for his further detention subject to provisions contained in Chapter XXXIII as to Bails and Bonds. The view taken by the High Court makes it a necessity for the Magistrate to release the accused on bail even if the accused is not otherwise entitled to the discretionary order of bail nor he applies for nor is ready to furnish bail only because the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to keep the accused in custody till an order committing the accused for trial is made. The High Court referred to sec. 209 which provides that the Magistrate shall commit the accused to Court of Sessions and subject to the provisions of the Code relating to bail, remand the accused to custody during and until the conclusion of the trial. This according to the High Court implies that the Magistrate can exercise power to release on bail or remand to the custody the accused only after making the order of commitment but the Magistrate has no such power anterior to the order of commitment and during the interregnum since the receipt of the charge sheet. This dichotomy read by the High Court in secs. 207 and 209 is certainly not borne out by the provisions of the Code. Sec. 207 as it then stood made it obligatory for the Magistrate to supply free of costs, copies of the documents set out in the section. The duty cast on the Magistrate by sec. 207 had to be performed in a judicial manner. To comply with sec. 207 which is cast in a mandatory language, when the accused is produced before the Magistrate, he has to enquire from the accused by recording his statement whether the copies of the various documents set out in sec. 207 have been supplied to him or not. No order committing the accused to the Court of Sessions can be made under sec. 209 unless the Magistrate fully complies with the provisions of sec. And if it is shown that the copies of relevant documents or some 549 of them are not supplied, the matter will have to be adjourned to get the copies prepared and supplied to the accused. This is implicit in section 207 and sec. 209 provides that on being satisfied that the requisite copies have been supplied to the accused, the Magistrate may proceed to commit the accused to the Court of Sessions to stand his trial. The statutory obligation imposed by sec. 207 read with sec. 209 on the Magistrate to furnish free of costs copies of documents is a judicial obligation. It is not an administrative function. It is a judicial function which is to be discharged in a judicial manner. It is distinctly possible that the copies may not be ready. That makes it necessary to adjourn the matter for some time which nay be spent in preparing the copies and supplying the same to the accused. The Magistrate can proceed to commit the accused for trial to the Court of Sessions only after he judicially discharges the function imposed upon him by sec. This conclusion is fortified by the provisions contained in Chapter XVIII which prescribed the procedure for trial of a case by Court of Sessions. Sec. 226 provides for opening the case for the prosecution. 227 confers power on the Court of Sessions to discharge the accused if upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith, the Judge considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. No duty is cast on the Court of Sessions to enquire before proceeding to hear the case of the prosecution under sec. 226 to ascertain whether the copies of the documents have been furnished to the accused because section 207 casts the obligation upon the Magistrate to perform the judicial function. Now, if under sec. 207, the Magistrate is performing a judicial function of ascertaining whether copies have been supplied or not, it would undoubtedly be an inquiry for the purpose of satisfying himself that sec. 207 has been complied with in letter and spirit. That satisfaction has to be judicial satisfaction. It is not a trial but something other than a trial and being judicial function it would necessarily be an inquiry. The making of an order committing the accused to the Court of Sessions will equally be a stage in the inquiry and the inquiry culminates in making the order of commitment. Thus, from the time the accused appears or is produced before the Magistrate with the police report under sec. 170 and the Magistrate proceeds to enquire whether sec. 207 has been complied with and then proceeds to commit the accused to the Court of Sessions, the proceeding before the Magistrate would be an inquiry as contemplated by sec. 2(g) of the Code. We find it difficult 550 to agree with the High Court that the function discharged by the Magistrate under sec. 207 is something other than a judicial function and while discharging the function the Magistrate is not holding an inquiry as contemplated by the Code. If the Magistrate is holding the inquiry obviously sec. 309 would enable the Magistrate to remand the accused to the custody till the inquiry to be made is complete. Sub sec. 2 of sec. 309 provides that if the Court, after taking cognizance of an offence or commencement of trial, finds it necessary or advisable to postpone the commencement or adjourn any inquiry or trial, it may, from time to time, for reasons to be recorded, postpone or adjourn the same on such terms as it thinks fit, for such time as it considers reasonable, and may by a warrant remand the accused if in custody. There are three provisos to sub sec. 2 which are not material. If, therefore, the proceedings before the Magistrate since the submission of the police report under sec. 170 and till the order of commitment is made under sec. 209 would be an inquiry and if it is an inquiry, during the period, the inquiry is completed, sec. 309(2) would enable the Magistrate to remand the accused to the custody. Therefore with respect, the High Court committed an error in holding 'that the order remanding the respondents to custody, made after cognizance of offence was taken cannot be justified under section 167(2), 209 and 309 of the Code and no other provision under which the respondents can be remanded to custody at this stage, has been indicated by the learned Government Advocate, we feel that it would be proper to accede to the request made by the respondents and to direct that they would be released on bail after furnishing adequate security to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda. ' The view taken by the High Court introduces a stage of compulsory bail not envisaged by the Code, and therefore, also the view of the High Court cannot be upheld. According to the High Court after the accused is brought before the court alongwith the police report, the Magistrate must forthwith commit the accused to the Court of Sessions because the Magistrate would have no jurisdiction in the absence of any provision to remand the accused to custody till the order committing the case to Court of Sessions is made. The view with respect is wholly untenable and must be set aside. Mr. Prithviraj, learned counsel, drew our attention to the decision of this Court in Gauri Shanker Jha vs The State of Bihar 551 and Ors '(1) This case is of no assistance because it dealt with the situation under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 which did require the Magistrate to be satisfied with prima facie case before an order committing an accused to the Court of Sessions could be made. In view of the discussion, this appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court granting bail to the respondents on the short ground that they could not be remanded to the custody before the order committing them to the Court of Sessions is made, is set aside, However, if in the meantime, the trial is over, no question of taking the respondents into custody pursuant to the order would arise. H.L.C. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 158 of 1972. Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and order dated the 12th November, 1971 of the Gujarat High Court at Ahmedabad in Criminal Appeal No. 219 of 1970. H.S. Patel, S.S. Khanduja and Lalita Kohli, for the appellant. section K. Zauri, Amaresh Kumar and M. V. Goswami, for the respondents 1 2. H. R. Khanna and M. N. Shroff, for respondent No. 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, J. This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of the Gujarat High Court convicting the appellant under section 36 read with section 8 of the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 20 of 1964 (referred to herein as 'the Act'), and sentencing him to pay a fine of Rs. 10/ . The judgment of conviction was recorded by the High Court in an appeal from an order of acquittal passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Godhra. An Inspector of Godhra Agricultural Produce Market Committee filed a complaint against the appellant charging him with having purchased a certain quantity of ginger in January and February, 1969 without obtaining a licence as required by the Act. The learned Magistrate accepted the factum of purchase but he acquitted the appellant on the ground that the relevant notification in regard to the inclusion of ginger was not shown to have been promulgated and published as required by the Act. The case was tried by the learned Magistrate by the application of procedure appointed for summary trials. That circumstance together with the token sentence of fine imposed by the High Court gives to the case a petty appearance. But occasionally, matters apparently petty seem on closer thought to contain points of importance though, regretfully, such importance comes to be realized by stages as the matter travels slowly from one court to another. As before the Magistrate so in the High Court, the matter failed to receive due attention: a fundamental premise on which the judgment of the High Court is based contains an assumption contrary to the record. Evidently, the attention of the High Court was not drawn either to the error of that assumption or to some of the more important aspects of the case which the parties have now perceived. It is necessary, in order to understand the controversy, to notice some of the relevant statutory provisions. In the erstwhile composite State of Bombay there was in operation an Act called the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 22 of 1939. On the bifurcation of that State on May 1, 1960 the new State of Gujarat was formed. The Bombay Act of 1939 was extended by an appropriate order to the State of Gujarat by the Government of that State. That Act remained in operation in Gujarat till September 1, 1964 on which date the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 20 of 1964, came into force. The Act was passed 'to consolidate and amend the law relating to the regulation of buying and selling of agricultural produce and the establishment of markets for agricultural produce in the State of Gujarat'. Section 4 of the Act empowers the State Government to appoint an officer to be the Director of Agricultural Marketing and Rural Finance. Sections 5, 6(1) and 6(5) of the Act read thus: '5. Declaration of intention of regulating purchase and sale of agricultural produce in specified area. (1) The Director may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare his intention of regulating the purchase and sale of such agricultural produce and in such area, as may be specified therein. Such notification shall also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper having circulation in the area and in such other manner as may be prescribed. (2) Such notification shall state that any objection or suggestion received by the Director within the period specified in the notification which shall not be less than one month from the date of the publication of the notification, shall be considered by the Director. (3) The Director shall also send a copy of the notification to each of the local authorities functioning in the area specified in the notification with a request to submit its objections and suggestions if any, in writing to the Director within the period specified in the notification. Declaration of market areas. (1) After the expiry of the period specified in the notification issued under section 5 (hereinafter referred to in this section as 'the said notification '), and after considering the objections and suggestions received before its expiry and holding such inquiry as may be necessary, the Director may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare the area specified in the said notification or any portion thereof to be a market area for the purposes of this Act in respect of all or any of the kinds of agricultural produce specified in the said notification. A notification under this section shall also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper having circulation in the said area and in such other manner, as may be prescribed. (5) After declaring in the manner specified in section 5 his intention of so doing, and following the procedure there in, the Director may, at any time by notification in the Official Gazette, exclude any area from a market area specified in a notification issued under sub section (1), or include any area therein and exclude from or add to the kinds of agricultural produce so specified any kind of agricultural produce.' By section 8, no person can operate in the market area or any part thereof except under and in accordance with the conditions of a licence granted under the Act. Section 36 of the Act provides, to the extent material, that whoever without holding a licence uses any place in a market area for the purchase or sale of any agricultural produce and thereby contravenes section 8 shall on conviction be punished with the sentence mentioned therein. Rule 3 of the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Markets Rules, 1965 provides that a notification under section 5 (1) or section 6(1) shall also be published by affixing a copy thereof at some conspicuous place in the office of each of the local authorities functioning in the area specified in the notification. The simple question, though important, is whether the notification issued under section 6(5) of the Act, covering additional varieties of agricultural produce like ginger and onion, must not only be published in the official gazette but must also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper. The concluding sentence of section 6(1) says that a notification under 'this section' 'shall also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper' having circulation in the particular area. The argument of the appellant is twofold: Firstly, that 'this section' means this subsection so that the procedure in regard to publication which is laid down in subsection (1) of section 6 must be restricted to notifications issued under that subsection and cannot be extended to those issued under subsection (5) of section 6; and secondly, assuming that the words 'this section' are wide enough to cover every sub section of section 6 the word 'shall' ought to be read as 'may'. First, as to the meaning of the provision contained in section 6 (1) of the Act. It means what it says. That is the normal rule of construction of statutes, a rule not certainly absolute and unqualified, but the conditions which bring into play the exceptions to that rule do not exist here. Far from it; because, the scheme of the Act and the purpose of the particular provision in section 6(1) underline the need to give to the provision its plain, natural meaning. It is not reasonable to assume in the legislature an ignorance of the distinction between a 'section' of the statute and the 'subsections' of that section. Therefore, the requirement laid down by section 6(1) that a notification under 'this section' shall also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper would govern any and every notification issued under any part of section 6, that is to say, under any of the sub sections of section 6. If this requirement was to govern notifications issued under sub section (1) of section 6 only, the legislature would have said so. But the little complexity that there is in this matter arises out of a known phenomenon, judicially noticed but otherwise disputed, that sometimes the legislature does not say what it means. That has given rise to a series of technical rules of interpretation devised or designed to unravel the mind of the law makers. If the words used in a statute are ambiguous, it is said, consider the object of the statute, have regard to the purpose for which the particular provision is put on the statute book and then decide what interpretation best carries out that object and purpose. The words of the concluding portion of section 6(1) are plain and unambiguous rendering superfluous the aid of artificial guide lines to interpretation. But the matter does not rest there. The appellant has made an alternative argument that the requirement regarding the publication in Gujarati in a newspaper is directory and not mandatory, despite the use of the word 'shall'. That word, according to the appellant, really means 'may'. Maxwell, Crawford and Craies abound in illustrations where the words 'shall' and 'may' are treated as interchangeable, 'Shall be liable to pay interest' does not mean 'must be made liable to pay interest', and 'may not drive on the wrong side of the road' must mean 'shall not drive on the wrong side of the road'. But the problem which the use of the language of command poses is: Does the legislature intend that its command shall at all events be performed ? Or is it enough to comply with the command in substance ? In other words, the question is : is the provision mandatory or directory ? Plainly, 'shall' must normally be construed to mean 'shall' and not 'may', for the distinction between the two is fundamental. Granting the application of mind, there is little or no chance that one who intends to leave a lee way will use the language of command in the performance of an act. But since, even lesser directions are occasionally clothed in words of authority, it becomes necessary to delve deeper and ascertain the true meaning lying behind mere words. Crawford on 'Statutory Construction ' (Ed. 1940, article 261, p. 516) sets out the following passage from an American case approvingly: 'The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the language in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern, and these are to be ascertained, not only from the phraseology of the provision, but also by considering its nature, its design, and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other.' Thus, the governing factor is the meaning and intent of the legislature, which should be gathered not merely from the words used by the legislature but from a variety of other circumstances and considerations. In other words, the use of the word 'shall ' or 'may ' is not conclusive on the question whether the particular requirement of law is mandatory or directory. But the circumstance that the legislature has used a language of compulsive force is always of great relevance and in the absence of anything contrary in the context indicating that a permissive interpretation is permissible, the statute ought to be construed as pre emptory. One of the fundamental rules of interpretation is that if the words of a statute are themselves precise and unambiguous, no more is necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense, the words themselves in such case best declaring the intention of the legislature. Section 6(1) of the Act provides in terms, plain and precise that a notification issued under the section 'shall also' be published in Gujarati in a newspaper. The word 'also ' provides an important clue to the intention of the legislature because having provided that the notification shall be published in the Official Gazette, section 6(1) goes on to say that the notification shall also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper. The additional mode of publication prescribed by law must, in the absence of anything to the contrary appearing from the context of the provision or its object, be assumed to have a meaning and a purpose. In Khub Chand vs State of Rajasthan, it was observed that 'the term 'shall ' in its ordinary significance is mandatory and the court shall ordinarily give that interpretation to that term unless such an interpretation leads to some absurd or inconvenient consequence or be at variance with the intent of the Legislature, to be collected from other parts of the Act. The construction of the said expression depends on the provisions of a particular Act, the setting in which the expression appears, the object for which the direction is given, the consequences that would flow from the infringement of the direction and such other considerations'. The same principle was expressed thus in Haridwar Singh vs Begum Sumbrui. 'Several tests have been propounded in decided cases for determining the question whether a provision in a statute, or a rule is mandatory or directory. No universal rule can be laid down on this matter. In each case one must look to the subject matter and consider the importance of the provision disregarded and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured.' Recently in the Presidential Election Case, the learned Chief Justice speaking on behalf of a seven Judge Bench observed: 'In determining the question whether a provision is mandatory or directory, the subject matter, the importance of the provision, the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured by the Act will decide whether the provision is directory or mandatory. It is the duty of the courts to get at the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the provision to be construed. 'The Key to the opening of every law is the reason and spirit of the law, it is the animus imponentis, the intention of the law maker expressed in the law itself, taken as a whole '. ' The scheme of the Act is like this: Under section 5(1) the Director of Marketing and Rural Finance may by a notification in the Official Gazette declare his intention of regulating purchase and sale of agricultural produce in the specified area. Such notification is also required to be published in Gujarati in a newspaper having circulation in the particular area. By the notification, the Director under section 5(2) has to invite objections and suggestions and the notification has to be stated that any such objections or suggestions received by the Director within the specified period, which shall not be less than one month from the date of the publication of the notification, shall be considered by the Director. After the expiry of the aforesaid period the Director, under section 6(1), has the power to declare an area as the market area in respect of the particular kinds of agricultural produce. This power is not absolute because by the terms of section 6(1) it can only be exercised after considering the objections and suggestions received by the Director within the stipulated period. The notification under section 6(1) is also required to be published in Gujarati in a newspaper. The power conferred by section 5(1) or 6(1) is not exhausted by the issuance of the initial notification covering a particular area or relating to a particular agricultural produce. An area initially included in the market area may later be excluded, a new area may be added and likewise an agricultural produce included in the notification may be excluded or a new variety of agricultural produce may be added. This is a salutary power because experience gained by working the Act may show the necessity for amending the notification issued under section 6(1). This power is conferred by section 6(5). By section 6(5), if the Director intends to add or exclude an area or an agricultural produce, he is to declare his intention of doing so in the manner specified in section 5 and after following the procedure prescribed therein. Thus, an amendment to the section 6(1) notification in regard to matters described therein is equated with a fresh declaration of intention in regard to those matters, rendering it obligatory to follow afresh the whole of the procedure prescribed by section 5. That is to say, if the Director intends to add or exclude an area or an agricultural produce, he must declare his intention by notification in the Official Gazette and such notification must also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper. Secondly, the Director must invite objections or suggestions by such notification and the notification must state that any objections or suggestions received within the stipulated time shall be considered by him. The Director must also comply with the requirement of sub section (5) of section 3 by sending a copy of the notification to each of the local authorities functioning in the particular area with a request that they may submit their objections and suggestions within the specified period. After the expiry of the period aforesaid and after considering the objections or suggestions received within that period, the Director may declare that the particular area or agricultural produce be added or excluded to or from the previous notification. This declaration has to be by a notification in the Official Gazette and the notification has to be published in Gujarati in a newspaper having circulation in the particular area. The last of these obligations arises out of the mandate contained in the concluding sentence of section 6(1). The object of these requirements is quite clear. The fresh notification can be issued only after considering the objections and suggestions which the Director receives within the specified time. In fact, the initial notification has to state expressly that the Director shall consider the objections and suggestions received by him within the stated period. Publication of the notification in the Official Gazette was evidently thought by the legislature not an adequate means of communicating the Director 's intention to those who would be vitally affected by the proposed declaration and who would therefore be interested in offering their objections and suggestions. It is a matter of common knowledge that publication in a newspaper attracts greater public attention than publication in the Official Gazette. That is why the legislature has taken care to direct that the notification shall also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper. A violation of this requirement is likely to affect valuable rights of traders and agriculturists because in the absence of proper and adequate publicity, their right of trade and business shall have been hampered without affording to them an opportunity to offer objections and suggestions, an opportunity which the statute clearly deems so desirable. By section 6(2), once an area is declared to be a market area, no place in the said area can be used for the purchase or sale of any agricultural produce specified in the notification except in accordance with the provisions of the Act. By section 8 no person can operate in the market area or any part thereof except under and in accordance with the conditions of a licence granted under the Act. A violation of these provisions attracts penal consequences under section 36 of the Act. It is therefore vital from the point of view of the citizens ' right to carry on trade or business, no less than for the consideration that violation of the Act leads to penal consequences, that the notification must receive due publicity. As the statute itself has devised an adequate means of such publicity, there is no reason to permit a departure from that mode. There is something in the very nature of the duty imposed by sections 5 and 6, something in the very object for which that duty is cast, that the duty must be performed. 'Some Rules', as said in Thakur Pratap Singh vs Sri Krishna, 'are vital and go to the root of the matter: they cannot be broken'. The words of the statute here must therefore be followed punctiliously. The legislative history of the Act reinforces this conclusion. As stated before, the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1939 was in force in Gujarat till September 1, 1964 on which date the present Act replaced it. Section 3(1) of the Bombay Act corresponding to section 5(1) of the Act provided that the notification `may ' also be published in the regional languages of the area. Section 4(1) of the Bombay Act which corresponds to section 6(1) of the Act provided that 'A notification under this section may also be published in the regional languages of the area in a newspaper circulated in the said area'. Section 4(4) of the Bombay Act corresponding to section 6(5) of the Act provided that exclusion or inclusion of an area of an agricultural produce may be made by the Commissioner by notification in the Official Gazette, 'subject to the provisions of section 3'. Section 4(4) did not provide in terms as section 6(5) does, that the procedure prescribed in regard to the original notification shall be followed if an area or an agricultural produce is to be excluded or included. The Gujarat legislature, having before it the model of the Bombay Act, made a conscious departure from it by providing for the publication of the notification in a newspaper and by substituting the word `shall ' for the word `may '. These are significant modifications in the statute which was in force in Gujarat for over 4 years from the date of reorganisation till September 1, 1964. These modifications bespeak the mind of the legislature that what was optional must be made obligatory. We are therefore of the opinion that the notification issued under section 6(5) of the Act, like that under section 6(1), must also be published in Gujarati in a newspaper having circulation in the particular area. This requirement is mandatory and must be fulfilled. Admittedly the notification (exhibit 10) issued under section 6(5) on February 16, 1968 was not published in a newspaper at all, much less in Gujarati. Accordingly, the inclusion of new varieties of agricultural produce in that notification lacks legal validity and no prosecution can be founded upon its breach. Rule 3 of the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Markets Rules, 1965 relates specifically and exclusively to notifications 'issued under subsection (1) of section 5 or under sub section (1) of section 6.' As we are concerned with a notification issued under sub section (5) of section 6, we need not go into the question whether Rule 3 is complied with. We may however indicate that the authorities concerned must comply with Rule 3 also in regard to notifications issued under sections 5(1) and 6(1) of the Act. After all, the rule is calculated to cause no inconvenience to the authorities charged with the duty of administering the Act. It only requires publication by affixing a copy of the notification at some conspicuous place in the office of each of the local authorities functioning in the area specified in the notification. The prosecution was conducted before the learned Magistrate in an indifferent manner. That is not surprising because the beneficent purpose of summary trials is almost always defeated by a summary approach. Bhailalbhai Chaturbhai Patel, an Inspector in the Godhra Agricultural Produce Market Committee, who was a material witness for proving the offence, said in his evidence that he did not know whether or not the notifications were published in any newspaper or on the notice board of the Godhra Municipality. The learned Magistrate acquitted the appellant holding that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the notifications were published and promulgated as required by law. In appeal, the High Court of Gujarat began the operative part of its judgment with a wrong assumption that exhibit 9 dated April 19, 1962 was a 'notification constituting the Godhra Market area.' In fact exhibit 9 was issued under section 4 A(3) of the Bombay Act as amended by Gujarat Act XXXI of 1961 declaring certain areas as 'market proper' within the Godhra Market area. The High Court was really concerned with the notification, exhibit 10, dated February 16, 1968 which was issued under section 6(5) of the Act and by which new varieties of agricultural produce like onion, ginger, sunhemp and jowar were added to the old list. The High Court set aside the acquittal by following the judgment dated February 12, 1971 rendered by A. D. Desai, J. in Cr. Appeal 695 of 1969. That judgment has no application because it arose out of the Bombay Act and the question before Desai, J. was whether section 4(1) of the Bombay Act was mandatory or directory. That section, as noticed earlier, provided that the notification 'may' also be published in the regional language of the area in a newspaper circulated in that area. The High Court, in the instant case, was concerned with section 6(5) of the Act which has made a conscious departure from the Bombay Act in important respect. The High Court did not even refer to the provisions of the Act and it is doubtful whether those provisions were at all brought to its notice. Everyone concerned assumed that the matter was concluded by the earlier judgment of Desai, J. For these reasons we set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore that of the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Godhra. Fine, if paid, shall be refunded to the appellant. P.H.P.

            "answer": "The appellant argued that 'this section' refers only to subsection (1) of section 6, so the newspaper publication requirement applies only to notifications under that subsection, not section 6(5)."
          },

            "question": "What was the appellant’s second argument regarding the word 'shall' in section 6(1)?",
            "answer": "The appellant argued that even if 'this section' includes section 6(5), the word 'shall' in the newspaper publication requirement should be interpreted as 'may,' making it directory rather than mandatory."
          },
          {
            "question": "How did the Supreme Court interpret the phrase 'this section' in section 6(1)?",
            "answer": "The Supreme Court held that 'this section' refers to the entire section 6, including all its subsections, so the newspaper publication requirement applies to notifications under section 6(5)."

          },
          {
            "question": "What role did the word 'also' play in the Supreme Court’s interpretation of section 6(1)?",

          },
          {
            "question": "What is the purpose of the newspaper publication requirement according to the Supreme Court?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Why did the Supreme Court consider the newspaper publication requirement vital?",
            "answer": "It is vital because non-compliance could hamper traders’ and agriculturists’ rights to trade and business without giving them a chance to object, and violations lead to penal consequences."

          {
            "question": "What did the Supreme Court suggest about Rule 3 compliance?",
            "answer": "The Court indicated that authorities must comply with Rule 3 for notifications under sections 5(1) and 6(1), as it causes no inconvenience and ensures publicity."

        "judgement": "Petition No. 350 of 1980. (Under Article 32 of the Constitution) M. M. Abdul Khoder, V. M. Tarkunde and EMS Enam for the Petitioner. V. J. Francis for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J. The lament of the petitioner, Gopalanachari, a septuagenarian languishing in a Kerala prison, is that in his case the law has become lawless and justice has fallen as the first casualty, a lot shared by several other prison mates. He wrote a letter dated nil to one of us (Krishna Iyer, J) complaining of illegal detention under section 110 Criminal Procedure Code (for short, the Code) where upon the jurisdiction of this Court was invoked and the following order was made: Shri M. M. Abdul Kader Senior Advocate with Mr. E. M. Sardul Enarn, Advocate on Record will be appointed as amicus curiae for the petitioner. Issue Show Cause Notice to the respondent state with a direction that the State shall furnish the total number of prisoners in the Sub Jail Kottayam, who are now kept in custody under section 110 Cr. P. C. and give further particulars as to how long they have been in prison on this score and whether the hearing of the cases under section 110 Cr. P. C. is over. The Superintendent of the Jail will further furnish the number of prisoners in prison who are above seventy years old and below 25 years. Copy of the Notice will be served on advocate amicus curiae as well as on Shri V. J. Francis, Advocate for the State. order will also be issued to the Superintendent of the Jail apart from the State. Post the matter on 2nd April, 1980. Even here we may state that Shri M. M. AbdulKader, Senior Advocate assisted by Shri E. M. Sadrul Enam, Advocate on Record, has rendered help as amicus curiae and enabled the court to set human rights in perspective in a section 110 situation. Shri Tarkunde also, as intervener, has helped the court which, incidentally strengthens the current of participative justice since leading members of the bar and public organisations in the field taking part in the court process in the shape of assistance in the cause of justice lends reality to the democracy of judicial remedies. The State, in response to the notice, put in a statement that in the Sub Jail at Kottayam there are as many as six prisoners detained under section 110 of the Code. Apparently, they have been suffering incarceration for several months, the petitioner himself having been in Jail from 23 2 1980. It is added by the Superintendent, Sub Jail that the petitioner 'is well known habitual prisoner of the Kerala State. he is known as 'Kallan Gopalan' ' i.e., thief Gopalan. In pathetic contrast to this stigmatising generalisation that the petitioner is a well known 'habitual' we find the averment in the petition of the detainee that he has been falsely implicated without any regard for human rights. His averments which have not been specifically contested may well be extracted: The case charged against me by the Kottayam Arpukkara Police in the Ettumanur Court is on night patrol, found hiding in the varanda of a shop, on asking the name and address: answered the name as Shankunni of Pala; on again questioning answered as Krishnan Kutty of Pankunnari and again on questioning, arrested on doubt as a 'K. D.' on the Pathanam Thitta Police Station and on enquiry it is found that the person is an ex criminal and not to be free; and for that, to obtain bail for two years, this is the charge against the person, submitted by the Police before the court. I am 71 years old. My native place is Pathanamthitta of Kottayam District. While I was living in my house having loss of eyesight and hearing power due to old age, a Police man known to me earlier, saw me on a road near my house, saying that he has to enquire something, taken me in a van to Arpukkara Police Station, after putting me in the lock up for ten days produced me before the Court after making the record as having arrested me on the previous night of producing me before the Court. But, it is such a position that if the bail alongwith the Bond as aforesaid is not furnished for a period of two years, I have to be inside the Jail for the said period. I submit before your Honour that I have much pain and agony that without considering that I am 71 years old and have difficulties due to that, and without seeing or giving remedy keeping me in the jail on such a fabricated case. There is no indication even in the statement put in by the Superintendent that there has been any conviction by a criminal courts as yet. The cases are pending, apparently without any sense of urgency and oblivious to the fact that for several months the petitioner has been deprived of his personal liberty even at the advanced age of 70. If men can be whisked away by the Police and imprisoned for long months and the court can keep the cases pending without thought to the fact that an old man is lying in cellular confinement without hope of his case being disposed of, article 21, read with articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution, remain symbolic and scriptural rather than a shield against unjust deprivation. Law is not a mascot but a defender of the faith. Surely, if law behaves lawlessly, social justice becomes a judicial hoax. A closer look at section 110 of the Code in the setting of peril to personal liberty thus becomes a necessity in this case. Counsel for the State, Shri Francis, amicus curiae Shri Abdul Kader and Senior Advocate Shri Tarkunde, agreed that unless the preventive power under section 110 were prevented from pervasive misuse by zealous judicial vigilance and interpretative strictness; many a poor man, maybe cast into prison by sticking the label of 'habitual' or by using such frightening expressions as 'desperate', 'dangerous' and 'hazardous to the community'. Law is what the law does, even as freedom is what freedom does. Going by that test, section 110 cannot be permitted in our free Republic to pick up the homeless and the have nots as it did when under British subjection because to day to be poor is not a crime in this country. George Bernard Shaw, though ignorant of section 110, did sardonically comment that 'the greatest of evils and the worst of crimes is poverty'. Article 21 insists that no man shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. In Maneka Gandhi case this Court in clearest terms strengthened the rule of law vis a vis personal liberty by insisting on the procedure contemplated by article 21 having to be fair and reasonable, not vagarious, vague and arbitrary: The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14. It must be 'right and just and fair' and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied. The principles and procedures are to be applied which, in any particular situation or set of circumstances, are right and just and fair. Natural justice, it has been said, is only 'fair play in action'. Nor do we wait for directions from Parliament. The common law has abundant riches; there may we find what Byles, J., called 'the justice of the common law'. Procedural safeguards are the indispensable essence of liberty. In fact, the history of personal liberty is largely the history of procedural safeguards and right to a hearing has a human right ring. In India, because of poverty and illiteracy, the people are unable to protect and defend their rights; observance of fundamental rights is not regarded as good politics and their transgression as bad politics. I sometimes pensively reflect that people’s militant awareness of rights and duties is a surer constitutional assurance of governmental respect and response than the sound and fury of the 'question hour' and the slow and unsure delivery of court writ. To sum up, 'procedure' in Article 21 means fair, not formal procedure. 'Law' is reasonable law, not any enacted piece. As Article 22 specifically spells out the procedural safeguards for preventive and punitive detention, a law providing for such detentions should conform to Article 22. It has been rightly pointed out that for other rights forming part of personal liberty, the procedural safeguards enshrined in Article 21 are available. The constitutional survival of section 110 certainly depends on its obedience to article 21, as this Court has expounded. Words of wide import, vague amplitude and far too generalised to be safe in the hands of the Police cannot be constitutionalised in the context of article 21 unless read down to be as a fair and reasonable legislation with reverence for human rights. A glance at section 110 shows that only a narrow signification can be attached to the words in clauses (a) to (g), 'by habit a robber.', 'by habit a receiver of stolen property.', 'habitually protects or harbours thieve.', 'habitually commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission of .', 'is so desperate and dangerous as to render his being at large without security hazardous to the community'. These expressions, when they become part of the preventive chapter with potential for deprivation of a man’s personal freedom up to a period of three years, must be scrutinised by the court closely and anxiously. The poor are picked up or brought up, habitual witnesses swear away their freedom and courts ritualistically commit them to prison and article 21 is for them a freedom under total eclipse in practice. Courts are guardians of human rights. The common man looks upon the trial court as the protector. The poor and the illiterate, who have hardly the capability to defend themselves, are nevertheless not 'non persons', the trial judges must remember, This Court in Hoskot’s case has laid down the law that a person in prison shall be given legal aid at the expense of the State by the court assigning counsel. In cases under section 110 of the Code, the exercise is often an idle ritual deprived of reality although a man’s liberty is at stake. We direct the trial magistrates to discharge their duties, when trying cases under section 110, with great responsibility and whenever the counter petitioner is a prisoner give him the facility of being defended by counsel now that article 21 has been reinforced by article 39A. Otherwise the order to bind over will be bad and void. We have not the slightest doubt that expressions like 'by habit', 'habitual', 'desperate', 'dangerous', 'hazardous' cannot be flung in the face of a man with laxity of semantics. The Court must insist on specificity of facts and be satisfied that one swallow does not make a summer and a consistent course of conduct convincing enough to draw the rigorous inference that by confirmed habit, which is second nature, the counter petitioner is sure to commit the offences mentioned if he is not kept captive. Preventive sections privative of freedom, if incautiously proved by indolent judicial processes, may do deeper injury. They will have the effect of detention of one who has not been held guilty of a crime and carry with it the judicial imprimatur, to boot. To call a man dangerous is itself dangerous; to call a man desperate is to affix a desperate adjective to stigmatise a person as hazardous to the community is itself a judicial hazard unless compulsive testimony carrying credence is abundantly available. A sociologist may pardonably take the view that it is the poor man, the man without political clout the person without economic stamina, who in practice gets caught in the coils of section 110 of the Code, although, we as court, cannot subscribe to any such proposition on mere assertion without copious substantiation. Even so, the court cannot be unmindful of social realities and be careful to require strict proof when personal liberty may possibly be the casualty. After all, the judicial process must not fail functionally as the protector of personal liberty. Indeed, several commissions, spread over decades, and even the Central Law Commission, in some of its reports, disclosed the presence in our midst of many habitual economic offenders and chronic corporate Criminals who, perhaps, may not be on the wanted list of the Police under section 110 of the Code although their dangerous activities may prove a hazard to the health and wealth of nation. Referring to a similar situation in American Society, Ralph Nader in his introduction to a well documented book titled 'America Inc.' has observed: In no clearer fashion has the corporation held the law at bay than in the latter’s paralysis toward the corporate crime wave. Crime statistics almost wholly ignore corporate or business crime; there is no list of the ten most wanted corporations; the law afford no means of regularly collecting data on corporate crime; and much corporate criminal behaviour (such as pollution) has not been made a crime because of corporate opposition. For example, willful and knowing violations of auto, tire, radiation, and gas pipeline safety standards are not considered crimes under the relevant statutes even if lives are lost as a result. The description of an array of corporate crimes in this forthright book reveals a legal process requiring courage, not routine duty, by officials to enforce the laws against such outrages. The law is much more comfortable sentencing a telephone coin box 'thief to five years than sentencing a billion dollar price fixing executive to six weeks in jail. In one recounting after another, the authors pile up the evidence towards one searing conclusion that corporate economic, product, and environmental crimes dwarf other crimes in damage to health, safety and property, in confiscation of theft of other people’s monies, and in control of the agencies which are supposed to stop this crime and fraud. And it all goes on year after year by blue chip corporate recidivists. Why? It is easy to answer 'power'. But that is the beginning, not the end, of understanding. True, American conditions are different from Indian conditions and these observations may not have necessary application to our societal situation. The point of Ralph Nader has, however, some relevance. Let us allay misunderstandings. We are clear in our mind that prevention is better than cure, in criminal law as in medicines especially when there is judicial supervision. Society cannot be left at the mercy of predators and bandits who, like wild beasts, prey upon the weak and the innocent and become a menace to peace and security of society. But personal liberty is a prized value and that is why we have insisted not merely upon the Police having to be careful before marching poor people into court under section but the Court itself having to be gravely concerned about using preventive provisions against helpless persons, not on formal testimony readily produced to order as we have noticed in a recent case, but on convincing testimony of clear and present danger to society. In the present case, the petitioner has been too long in prison, and we take it that no circumstances placed before us justify keeping him longer in custody. The trial magistrate will, having regard to the observations we have made, drop the proceedings in the interests of justice. The other prisoner above 70 years also should be enlarged right away (Kutty Thankappan, U.T. No. 665). We expect any Government which has any regard for human rights not to use section 110 of the Code, torturesome fashion, against the weak and the poor merely because they belong to the 'have not' class and can be easily apprehended as 'habitual' this or that or dangerous or desperate. We draw the attention of the State Government to the likely misuse of the preventive provisions and expect it to issue suitable instructions to the Police minions so that the law will be legitimated by going into action where it must strike and by being kept sheathed where there is no need for indiscriminate display. With these observations, we direct the release of the petitioner and Kutty Thankappan, U.T. No. 665 on their own bonds until formal orders are passed by the trial court in the regular criminal proceedings under section 110 of the Code. P.B.R. Petition allowed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 32 of 1982. From the Judgment and Order dated 1.10.1981 of the Delhi High Court in Criminal Misc. (Main) No. 304 of 1980. S.L. Chowdhary and Pradeep Misra for the Appellant. Rakesh K. Khanna and R.P. Singh for the Respondent. The following order of the Court is delivered: Even though the dispute between the parties came to this Court from an initial order passed under Section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Court realising that the dispute was between close relatives in respect of their interests in certain properties which were also the subject matter in a Civil Suit No. 434/78 (Remand) of the Court of Sub Judge, First Class, Delhi, advised the parties to have the same resolved through an Arbitrator. On the parties agreeing, this Court passed an order on September 5, 1986 recording the agreement to refer the dispute to arbitration and appointed Mr. Justice V.D. Misra, retired Chief Justice of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, as the Sole Arbitrator. The parties had agreed to deposit a sum of Rs. 3,000 each with the Arbitrator to meet with his expenses and remuneration subject to further directions that may be made in that behalf. It was further directed that the learned Arbitrator will render a speaking award within four months. In view of the said agreement, the appeal was allowed and the High Court 's impugned order was set aside. It appears that thereafter one of the parties, namely, Jagdish Chander Bhatia, did not deposit the expenses with the Arbitrator and raised objection in regard to the arbitration proceedings on the plea that the property in dispute was proposed to be resumed by the Union of India. In the meantime, it appears that the sole Arbitrator passed away and in his place Mr. Justice M.S. Gujral retired Chief Justice of the High Court of Sikkim, was appointed the Sole Arbitrator. This Court did not approve of the conduct of Jagdish Chander Bhatia in not depositing the amount and in trying to avoid adjudication of the dispute through arbitration. After this order was passed on October 12, 1990 by which a further sum of Rs. 8,000 was directed to be deposited with the Arbitrator, subject to the Arbitrator deciding who should bear the cost, the newly appointed Arbitrator entered upon the reference and submitted his award on November 14, 1991. This concluding part of his Award reads as under: 'House No. 17 would entirely belong to Lachhman Das Bhatia whereas House No.18 would be jointly owned by Lachhman Das and Jagdish Chander. Lachhman Das would have 76.50% share whereas Jagdish Chander would have 23.50% share in House No.18. As House No.17 has entirely been given to Lachhman Das Bhatia in all fairness, Jagdish Chander Bhatia should give vacant possession of House No.17 to Lachhman Das Bhatia.' The parties were directed to bear their own costs of the arbitration proceedings except that Jagdish Chander Bhatia had to pay Rs. 4,000 to Lachhman Das Bhatia as his share of the Arbitrator 's fees which he had initially failed to deposit. Against this award, Jagdish Chander Bhatia (hereinafter called 'the objector ') has filed objections under Section 30 of the which provision reads as under: 'An award shall not be set aside except on one or more of the following grounds, namely (a) that an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself or the proceedings; (b) that an award has been made after the issue of an order by the Court superseding the arbitration proceedings have become invalid under Section 35; (c) that an award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid.' It was conceded by the learned counsel for the Objector that clause (b) would not be attracted. His main submission was that the Arbitrator had misconducted himself, in that, he did not take into consideration several documents which were placed on record before him which support the Objector 's case and hence the Award was invalid. He, therefore, partly relied on clauses (a) and (c) for setting aside the Award. The documents to which the learned counsel for the objector invited our attention, are to be found in Vol.2 of the paper book placed before us. These documents are 31 in number and they mainly relate to the rights and interests of the parties in properties situate in that part which now belongs to the Dominion of Pakistan. Since they were refugees they had made certain claims under the law governing rehabilitation of displaced persons in respect of the properties left behind by them. These documents show that the claim was sanctioned in the name of Punnu Ram Lachhman Das in respect of the properties left behind by the family. On the strength of that claim, House No.18 was purchased in the said name. The Arbitrator, however, came to the conclusion, as is evident from the discussion from paragraph 26 and onwards of the Award, that the property in question was purchased for Rs. 12,850 from the funds contributed by Punnu Ram and Lachhman Das, the former paying Rs. 9,233 and the latter Rs. 3,617. This is the conclusion reached by the Arbitrator as is evident from paragraph 37 of the Award. The share of the Objector was held to be 1/7th in the share of Punnu Ram, since deceased. It was on this finding recorded by the Arbitrator that he passed the ultimate order extracted above. The arbitrator has made a speaking award setting out his reasons for the conclusions reached by him. He has thus complied with the direction of this Court given earlier. On a perusal of the award, it becomes clear that the Arbitrator did not go into the rights and interests of the parties including the HUF in the properties left behind in the Dominion of Pakistan. That was, in our opinion, not necessary because the fact that the claim was sanctioned in the name to the Punnu Ram Lachhman Das was never in dispute. The short question, which the Arbitrator was required to consider, was as regards the title of the properties which were the subject matter of the reference which included the property purchased for Rs. 12,850 on the strength of that claim. In dealing with that question the Arbitrator came to the conclusion that Punnu Ram and Lachhman Das had contributed the entire consideration of Rs. 12,850 and hence they were the owners of the property and on the death of Punnu Ram inheritance opened insofar as his share in the property was concerned and the Arbitrator came to the conclusion that the Objector was entitled to 1/7th out of the share of the deceased. Since the contribution made for payment of the price was not equal, the Arbitrator allotted a larger share to Punnu Ram and consequently the Objector has got a share on the basis thereof. Practically, all the documents included in Vol.2 relate to the interest of the parties and their HUF in the properties left behind in the Dominion of Pakistan. The learned counsel for the Objector then tried to take us into the rights and interests of the parties in those properties, but we declined to go into the same as we thought that the Arbitrator was right that he was called upon to decide the interest of the parties in Houses Nos. 17 and 18 alone which were the subject matter of the reference. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the Arbitrator had not misconducted himself by refusing to enumerate those documents in Vol.2 in his award because he was bound by the scope of the reference which was limited to Houses Nos. 17 and 18 and not the properties left behind in the Dominion of Pakistan by the parties. For this reason, we are of the opinion that there is no infirmity on the face of the award which would entitle us to exercise jurisdiction under Section 30 of the . This Court pointed out in Food Corporation of India vs Joginderpal Mohinderpal & Anr., [1989] 2 SCC 347 that an award of an Arbitrator can only be interfered with or set aside or modified within the four corners of the procedure provided by the statute. The Court must find out whether the Arbitrator has misconducted himself or there was any infirmity in the procedure, such as, the Arbitrator having travelled beyond the terms of the reference or there being an error apparent on the face of the award. It is not misconduct on the part of an Arbitrator to come to an erroneous conclusion on a disputed issue. In case of error apparent on the face of the award, the award can be set aside only if there is any proposition of law on which the award is based which is in conflict with law. It must be demonstrated to the Court that the reasons given by the Arbitrator are so palpably erroneous in law that they have resulted in the Arbitrator taking a view which cannot be sustained in law. To put it differently the Court does not sit in appeal and does not re assess the evidence. Even if the Court feels that had it been left to it, it would have assessed the evidence differently that would not be a valid ground for setting aside the award. In Hind Builders vs Union of India, [1990] 3 SCC 338, this Court pointed out that where on an interpretation of any contract or document, two views are possible and the Arbitrator accepts one view while the other view is more appealing it would not be open to the Court to interfere with the Award. We, therefore, in the facts and circumstances of this case, see no reason to interfere with the award of the Arbitrator. The Suit No. 434/78 pending in the Court of the Sub Judge, Delhi was disposed of by that Court, and an appeal, being Civil Appeal No. 211 of 1979 (Jagdish Chander Bhatia vs Lachhman Das Bhatia) preferred on April 23, 1979 against that decree, is pending in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi. We transfer that appeal to our file and make the Arbitrator 's award the rule of the Court. The decree of the trial court is set aside and a decree in terms of the award will be drawn up in the appeal proceedings arising out of Suit No. 434/78. We, however, do not make any order as to costs in the present proceedings. N.P.V. Appeal disposed of.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 783 of 1975. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 9th April 1975 of the Allahabad High Court in Application No. A. 7 ion Petition No. 22 of 1974. R K. Garg, section C. Agarwala and V. J. Francis, for the appellant. D. Mukherjee and Pramod Swarup, for respondent No. 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKRIA J. We have already announced our order in this appeal on the 2nd May 1975. We now proceed to give our reasons therefor. 193 The appellant, Shri Ram Autar Singh Bhadauria. Respondent No. 1 Chaudhari Ram Gopal Singh and Respondents 2 to 11 contested election, as rival candidates from U. P. Legislative Assembly Constituency (No. 293), Sarsaul. The poll was held on 24 2 1974. The appellant was declared elected. The total number of votes polled was 72735. Out of these, the appellant secured 23626 and Respondent 1, his nearest rival polled 23604, the margin being of 22 votes only. Respondent 1 filed an election petition challenging the election of the appellant inter alia on the ground (vide para 9(1) of the petition) that the result of the election so far as the returned candidate was concerned materially affected by improper reception and rejection of votes and mistakes in counting. It was alleged: 'para 11(a). That in a number of polling stations, the instruments supplied to the electors for the purposes of stamping on or near the symbol of the candidate to whom he intends to vote, was seal of Presiding officer which was meant to be put on the reverse of the ballot papers. Since the electors were supplied these instruments by the Presiding officer for marking the ballot papers the electors indicated their choice by marking in the column of the petitioner with that instrument. There were 41 such ballot papers which were clear votes for the petitioner that were illegally rejected by the Presiding officer on the ground that the electors' choice was expressed through the instrument meant for the Presiding officer for stamping on the reverse side of the ballot papers. Particulars of such ballot papers are given in Schedule I attached to the Election Petition. (b) That in a number of polling stations, the electors were issued ballot papers along with the counter foil. While issuing the ballot papers to the electors, the polling staff deputed there did not detach the counter foil and the electors after putting seal mark put the ballot papers along with the counter foil in the ballot box. It was due to the mistake of the staff deputed at the polling station. The number of some of such ballot papers are 100976, 100977, 100978, 100979, 100980, 100982, 100983 and 100984. These ballot papers clearly indicate the votes for the petitioner but they were illegally rejected on the ground that the identity of the elector can be established. The reason on which it was rejected was wholly illegal. The particulars of such ballot papers are given in Schedule IT attached to this election petition.' In his written statement, the successful candidate stated: '65(1). That the contents of paragraph No. 9(1) of the Election Petition are not admitted. The result of the election in so far as the answering respondent is concerned has not been materially affected by any improper reception or 194 rejection, or by wrong arithmetical and clerical mistake in counting of votes and/or counting and acceptance of void votes in favour of the answering respondent. In fact no improper reception or rejection or arithmetical mistake or any clerical mistake was done in favour of the answering respondent 16. That the contents of paragraph No. 11 (a) of the petition are wrong and denied. It is wrong to say that 41 ii ballot papers mentioned in Schedule I or any ballot paper counted in favour of the respondent No. 1 by marking with the seal of the Presiding officer. It is admitted that the ballot papers on which unauthorised seal was found were rejected. Some of these rejected ballot papers may be of the petitioner but most of them were of respondent No. 1 and other contesting candidates. That the contents of para 11 (b) of the petition and Schedule II are not admitted as stated. Only on one polling station, due to the mistake of the Presiding officer some ballot papers were issued along with their counter foils. The counterfoils did contain the name and signature or thumb impression of the voters attached to the ballot paper. In these circumstances such ballot papers were rejected by the Returning officer. It is submitted that such ballot paper were in respect of all the candidates including the respondent No. 1. Further, no such objection was raised at the time of counting by the Petitioner or his election agent and/or his counting Agent. That no different criteria was adopted by the Returning officer in the matter of acceptance or rejection of ballot papers and the respondent No. 1 maintains that many ballot papers in which the Electors expressed their choice in favour of the respondent No. 1 by putting the seal of the Presiding officer as supplied by the Presiding officer, were wrongly rejected during the counting by the Returning officer.' Respondent 1 did not adduce any evidence in support of the allegations extracted above. But on 24 2 1975, he made an application before the High Court, praying for scrutiny and recount of the ballot papers. The allegations in para 11(a) and (b) of the election petition were reiterated in the application. The appellant in reply filed a counter affidavit which was substantially a reproduction of his reply in the written statement. The learned Judge of the High Court by his order, dated 9 4 1975, allowed that application and directed scrutiny and recount of ballot papers on the view that: (a) The appellant 'was declared to have won by a very small margin of only 22 votes'. 195 (b) 'lt is not in dispute that a number of ballot papers were rejected by the Returning officer as invalid because the polling staff of a particular polling station forgot to detach the counter foils of a number of ballot papers. As the counter foils contained the identity of the voters, the ballot papers were rejected for no fault of the voters, but because of negligence or incompetence on the part of the polling staff'. (c) 'It is also the admitted case of the parties that a number of ballot papers were rejected because the voters cast their votes by putting their mark not with the marking instrument issued by the Election Commission but with the marking or stamping instrument issued by the Election Commission for the use of the Presiding officers. This happened because instead of the instrument which the polling staff should have given to a voter to put the mark showing for which candidate he wanted to vote, the polling staff by mistake handed over to the voter the stamp meant for the Presiding officer to affix on the back of the ballot paper.' (d) lt 'The petition, the written statement, the recriminatory petition filed by the respondent (now appellant) and the reply thereto filed by the petitioner would show that this is a case in which both parties have pleaded that there was wrong reception, rejection and counting of votes.' It is against this order, dated 9 4 75 of the High Court that this appeal has been filed by the returned candidate after obtaining special leave. Having heard learned Counsel on both sides, we are of opinion that the order made by the High Court for a general scrutiny and recount of all the ballot papers cast at the election, was not justified. The returned candidate had not categorically and specifically admitted the allegations made in the election petition with regard to the improper rejection of the ballot papers. This will be clear from a comparative reading of Paragraph 11 (a) and (b) of the petition and the answers thereto given in the written statement, which have been reproduced above verbatim. It is to be noted that the reply of the returned candidate to the contents of the aforesaid sub paras (a) and (b) starts with a denial or a non admission. Such a traverse is then followed by qualified and vague admissions that some ballot papers were rejected because they were not marked with the instrument meant for this purpose, or bore the names or signatures of the voters on the counter foils that remained attached to them, owing to the mistake of the Presiding Officer. After having thus replied to the petitioner’s allegations, the returned candidate said that most of these rejected 196 ballots had been cast for him and not for the petitioner. This was a counter assertion which was not, strictly speaking, relevant to the case set up in the petition. Mr. Mukherjee, learned Counsel for Respondent 1 (election petitioner) has drawn our attention to the 'Additional Pleas' in the written statement of the appellant. According to Counsel it were these pleas, more than anything else, that led to the finding 'that this is a case in which both parties have pleaded that there was wrong reception, rejection and counting of votes.' We will discuss this aspect of the case a little later. At this place it will be sufficient to say that since the returned candidate in his written statement did not specifically and fully admit all the facts alleged in Paragraph 11 (a) and (b) of the petition, the Court could not dispense with proof of those facts altogether. For instance, in reply to the facts alleged in Para 11 (a) of the petition, the returned candidate did not admit that the instrument with which such rejected ballot papers were found stamped, was supplied by the Presiding officer. On the contrary, the reply to sub para (a) begins with a clear traverse: 'that the contents of paragraph No. 11 (a) of the petition are wrong and denied'. This denial notwithstanding, the learned Judge appears to have erroneously assumed this fact as admitted by the returned candidate. The parties being at variance on this material point, this issue of fact was required to be proved by the party alleging it. Now, we come to the finding of the learned Judge as to the wrong reception and rejection of votes being a common ground between the parties. We have catalogued this finding as ground (b) which is one of the four pillars on which the impugned order rests. This ground, according to Mr. Mukherji, draws particulars support from the 'Additional Pleas' set up in the written statement. We do not propose to over burden this judgment by reproducing all that has been stated in Paragraph 47 to 56 of the written statement under the caption 'Additional Pleas'. It will be sufficient to extract some of it by way of sample: '47. That the Returning officer did not allow any improper acceptance or rejection against the interest or the election petitioner, rather mistakes of improper acceptance and rejection of ballot papers were done against the interests of the answering respondent. That many ballot papers which bore the major portion of the stamp mark within the column of the Respondent No. 1 were wrongly rejected by the Returning officer at the time of counting. That as in the case of the Election Petitioner the Ballot Papers in favour of the Respondent No. 1 with which counterfoils were attached were rejected. In case the Hon’ble Court finds that similar ballot papers in favour of 197 the election petitioner are to be accepted, the ballot papers in favour of the Respondent No. 1 in the same condition should also be accepted and counted as valid votes in favour of the Respondent No. 1. That many ballot papers containing votes in favour of the Respondent No. 1. were wrongly put in the bundles of the votes in favour of the Election Petitioner. That the bundles of ballot papers in favour of the Respondent No. 1 in fact contained more than SO ballot papers and there was thus wrong counting. I say that the Respondent No. 1 filed application before the Returning officer on 27 2 74 but the Returning officer without considering the submissions made therein rejected it and did not order for recount.' If we may say so with respect, in taking these Additional Pleas into account, the learned Judge completely misdirected himself. He overlooked the fact that these Pleas were irrelevant to and beyond the scope of the enquiry into the allegations in the election petition falling under section 100(1)(d)(iii) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. These 'Additional Pleas' were in the nature of recriminatory pleas which could not be investigated in this election petition. As clarified by this Court in Jabar Singh vs Genda Lal(1), the scope of the inquiry in a case under section 100(1) (d) (iii) is to determine whether any votes had been improperly cast in favour of the returned candidate or any votes had been improperly refused or rejected in regard to any other candidate. These are the only two matters which would be relevant for deciding whether the election of the returned candidate had been materially affected or not. At such an enquiry the burden is on the petitioner to prove his allegations. In fact section 97(1) of the Act has no application to a case falling under section 100(1) (d) (iii). The scope of the enquiry is limited for the simple reason that what the clause requires to be considered, is, whether the election of the returned candidate has been materially affected and nothing else. It is true that in a composite election petition wherein the petitioner claims not only that the election of the returned candidate is void but also that the petitioner or some other person be declared to have been duly elected, section 97 would also come into play and allow the returned candidate to recriminate and raise counter pleas in support of his case, 'but the pleas of the returned candidate under section 97 have to be tried after a declaration has been made under section 100 of the Act. The first part of the enquiry in regard to the validity of the election of the returned candidate has therefore to be tried within the narrow limits prescribed by section 100(1) (d) (iii) and the latter part of the enquiry governed by section 101 (a) will have to be tried on a broader basis permitting the returned candidate to lead evidence in support of the pleas taken by him in his recriminatory petition; but even in such a case the 198 enquiry necessary while dealing with the dispute under section 101 (a) will not be wider if the returned candidate has failed to recriminate and in a case of this type, the duty of the Election Tribunal will not be to count and scrutinise all the votes cast at the election. Moreover, in the instant case, it is a matter of controversy to be decided as to whether the recriminatory petition filed by the appellant is within time or not. The above being the law on the point, it is clear that the learned Judge was in error in ordering general inspection and recount of the total votes polled at the election, merely because in these Additional Pleas the returned candidate also had by way of recrimination, complained of wrong reception and rejection of votes and wrong counting of votes. The pleas at this stage could not be investigated even in the recriminatory petition filed by the returned candidate. They were beyond the scope of the enquiry into the petitioner’s case which (as set up in Para 11 of the petition) fall under section 100(1)(d)(iii) of the Act Further, the High Court did not properly apply its mind to the question, whether on the facts alleged in Para 11 (a) and (b) of the petition assuming the same to be correct a prima facie case for improper rejection of The 50 ballot papers referred to therein, had been made out. In other words, if the defects in these 50 ballot papers were attributable to the mistakes or negligence of the Presiding officer or his staff, would it take those ballot papers out of the mischief of clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 56(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 Rule 56 runs thus: '(1) Subject to such general or special directions, if any, as may be given by Election Commission in this behalf, the ballot papers taken out of all boxes used in a constituency shall be mixed together and then arranged in convenient bundles and scrutinised. (2) The returning officer shall reject a ballot paper (a) if it bears any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified, or (b) if, to indicate the vote, it bears no mark at all or bears a mark made otherwise than with the instrument supplied for the purpose, or (c) if votes are given on it in favour of more than one candidate, or (d) if the mark indicating the vote thereon is placed in such manner as to make it doubtful to which candidate the vote has been given, or 199 (e) if it is a spurious ballot paper, or (f) if it is so damaged or mutilated that its identity as a genuine ballot paper cannot be established, or (g) if it bears a serial number, or is of a design different from the serial numbers, or, as the case may be, design, or the ballot papers authorised for use at the particular polling station, or (h) if it does not bear (both, the mark and the signature) which it should have borne under the provisions of sub rule (1) of rule 38; Provided that where the returning officer is satisfied that any such defect as is mentioned in clause (g) or clause (h) has been caused by any mistake or failure on the part of a Presiding officer or polling officer, the ballot paper shall not be rejected merely on the ground of such defect; Provided further that a ballot paper shall not be rejected merely on the ground that the mark indicating the vote is indistinct or made more than once, if the intention that the vote shall be for a particular candidate clearly appears from the way the paper is marked. (3) to (5): . . (6) Every ballot paper which is not rejected under this rule shall be counted as one valid vote: Clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 56(2) are referable to Rule 38 which requires every elector to whom ballot paper has been issued under Rule 38 to maintain secrecy of voting and 'to make a mark on the ballot paper with the instrument supplied for the purpose on or near the symbol of the candidate for whom he intends to vote.' Rule 38 is also relevant. This Rule requires every ballot paper and the counterfoil attached thereto to be stamped on the back by the Presiding officer with such distinguishing mark as the Election Commission may direct. Every such ballot paper before it is issued is required to be signed in full on its back by the Presiding officer. Sub rule (2) requires that at the time of issuing of ballot paper, the Polling officer shall on its counterfoil record the electoral roll number of the elector and obtain his signature or thumb impression. The object of these rules is to secure not only the secrecy of the ballot but also to eliminate chances of sharp practices in the conduct of elections. Their requirements are therefore mandatory, and a defect arising from their non observance inexorably entails rejection of the defective ballot paper except to the extent covered by the Provisions to Rule 56(2). 200 In the case of 41 ballot papers mentioned in para 11(a), what happened was that instead of marking those ballot papers with the instrument supplied for this purpose by the Election Commission the electors concerned stamped it with the instrument meant to be used exclusively by the Presiding officer for stamping the counterfoils and lacks of the ballot papers. The Court had to apply its mind as to whether these facts by themselves were sufficient to attract Rule 56 2 (b) ? This question would further resolve itself into two issues: (i) Was the stamping instrument with which these electors 'marked' the ballot papers, given to them by the Presiding officer or any member of his staff ? (ii) If so, could these ballot papers be deemed to have been marked with 'the instrument supplied for the purpose' within the contemplation of Rules 38 and 56(2)(b) ? The first one was an issue of fact, the determination of which would depend on evidence. The second issue would arise only on proof of the first, and involve the question of interpreting and applying the phrase 'instrument supplied for the purpose'. This phrase is capable of two interpretations one narrow and literal, and the other liberal and contextual. Without there being any proof of the fact that the stamping instrument was handed over to the 41 electors by the Presiding officer/Polling officer, a final expression of opinion on our part would be academic and premature. It will be sufficient to reiterate that the provisions of Rules 38 and 56(2) (a) and (b) with which we are concerned in this case are mandatory and strict compliance therewith is essential. Once it is established that the fault specified in clauses (a) or (b) of Rule 56(2) has been committed, there is no option left with the Returning officer but to reject the faulty ballot paper. We would further make it clear that even if any such defect as is mentioned in clauses (a) or (b) of Rule 56 is caused by any mistake or failure on the part of the Returning officer or Polling Officer, the Returning officer would be bound to reject the ballot paper on the ground of such defect. That such is the imperative of Rule 56(2) is clear from the fact that the said clauses (a) and (b) have advisedly been excluded from the first Proviso to Rule 56(2) which gives a limited discretion in the matter of rejection to the Returning officer only where the defect is of a kind mentioned in clauses (g) and (h) of this sub rule. In the view that such Rules relating to the conduct of elections, are required to be observed strictly, we are fortified by the ratio of this Court’s decision in Hari Vishnu Kamath vs Syed Ishaque and ors.(1) In That case, voters for the House of the People in Polling Stations Nos. 316 and 317 in Sobhapur were given ballot papers with brown bar intended for the State Assembly, instead of ballot papers with green bar which had to be used for the House of the People. The total number of votes so polled was 443, out of which, 62 were in favour of the then appellant, 301 in favour of the first respondent therein and the remaining in favour of the other candidates. Rule 47(1)(c) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1951 provided that 'a ballot paper contained in a ballot box shall be rejected if it bears 201 any serial number or mark different from the serial number or marks of ballot papers authorised for use at the polling station or the polling booth at which the ballot box in which it was found, was used.' The election petitioner contended that in accordance with this rule, the ballot papers received at the two polling stations, not having the requisite mark; should have been excluded. The returned candidate pleaded that the Returning officer had rightly accepted 301 votes because Rule 47 was directory and not mandatory. It was contended that the electors were not at fault and that the wrong ballot papers were issued due to the lapse on the part of the Returning officer and that to reject the votes of the electors for the failure of the Polling officer to deliver the correct ballot papers under Rule 23 would be to disfranchise them, and that a construction which involve such a consequence should not be adopted. This Court repelled the contention in these terms: 'If the word ‘shall’ is thus to be construed in a mandatory sense in Rule 47(1) (a), (b) and (d), it would be proper to construe it in the same sense in Rule 47(1) (c) also. There is another reason which clinches the matter against the 1st respondent. The practical bearing of the distinction between a provision which is mandatory and one which is directory is that while the former must be strictly observed in the case of the latter it is sufficient that it is substantially complied with. How is this rule to be worked when the Rule provides that a ballot paper shall be rejected ? There can be no degrees of compliance so far as rejection is concerned, and that is conclusive to show that the provision is mandatory.' The above observations are apposite. Judged by the guiding principle enunciated therein, it can safely be said that the provisions of rule 56(2) (a) and (b) read with Rule 38, are mandatory and not merely directory. It was contended by the learned Counsel for the respondent before us, that the Provisos to sub rule (2) of Rule 56 are only illustrative and not exhaustive, and consequently, the principles underlying these Provisos would give a discretion to the Returning Officer not to reject a ballot paper on the ground of a defect caused by mistake or negligence of the Presiding officer/or Polling officer, notwithstanding that such defect is one mentioned in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Rule 56(2). This contention is not tenable. The word ‘shall’ used in the opening Part of sub rule (2) read in the context of the general scheme of this Rule shows that it is mandatory. Sub rule (5) puts the matter beyond doubt. It says that 'every ballot paper which is not rejected under this sub rule shall be counted as one valid vote'. Rule 56 is a complete code by itself. The Provisos to Sub rule (2) are exhaustive of the kinds of defects which the Returning officer may condone, if those defects are caused by the mistake or failure of the Polling Staff. The first Proviso is in terms limited to defects falling under Clause 202 (g) or (h). Neither of these Provisos appears to be attracted if the defects is any of the defects mentioned in clauses (a) or (b). The learned Judge of the High Court has not applied his mind as to whether the facts alleged in Paragraph 11(b) of the petition, if correct, would fall within the mischief of clause (d) of Rule 56(2). This will necessarily require consideration of the issue whether there has been an infringement if any of the provisions of Rule 38, referable to clause (a) of Rule 56(2). Another point in this context, for consideration will be whether the 'counterfoil' can be said to be an integral part of the 'ballot paper' so that any writing or marks of identification of the voter on a counterfoil issued to the voter by mistake, is to be deemed to be a defect of the nature mentioned in clause (a) of Rule 56(2). The High Court has not at all addressed itself any of these questions. Times out of number, this Court has pointed out that a general Scrutiny and recount of the ballot papers should not be lightly ordered. Before making such an extraordinary order, the Court must be satisfied that all the material facts have been pleaded and proved and that such a course is imperatively necessary in the interest of justice. In the case in hand the allegations in the election petition (vide Paragraph 11) are confined to 41 plus 9, total 50 votes only (vide Paragraph). There was no foundation in the petition for ordering a general recount. Nor could the Additional Pleas in the written statement of the returned candidate be taken into account for making an order for general inspection of the ballots, because investigation of those pleas was beyond the scope of the case alleged in Para 11 of the petition falling under section 100(1) (d) (iii) of the Act. We have said enough. We will close the discussion by repeating the note of caution that this Court speaking through V. Krishna Iyer J. recently sounded in Chanda Singh vs Ch. Shiv Ram(1). 'A democracy runs smooth on the wheels of periodic and pure elections. The verdict at the polls announced by the Returning Officers leads to the formation of Governments. A certain amount of stability in the electoral process is essential. If the counting of the ballots are interfered with by too frequent and flippant recounts by courts a new system is introduced through the judicial instrument. Moreover, the secrecy of the ballot which is sacrosanct becomes exposed to deleterious prying, if recount of votes is made easy. The general reaction, if there is judicial relaxation on this issue, may well be a fresh pressure on luckless candidates, particularly when the winning margin is only of a few hundred votes as here, to ask for a recount Micawberishly looking for numerical good fortune or windfall of chance discovery of illegal rejection or reception of ballots. This may tend to a dangerous disorientation which invades the democratic order by injecting widespread scope for reopening of declared returns, unless the Court restricts recourse to recount to cases of genuine apprehension of miscount or illegality or other compulsions of justice necessitating such a drastic step.' In the result we allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court for general scrutiny and recount of the ballot papers. However, the High Court will have to determine, (after taking such evidence as may be necessary) inter alia, (i) whether the instrument which was used for marking the 41 votes (referred to in the election petition) was supplied to the voters by the Presiding officer or any other member of his Polling Staff. If on evidence adduced, the learned Judge finds this issue in the affirmative, the further question to be considered would be (ii) whether such supply would answer the legal requirement of 'instrument supplied for the purpose' in Rule 56(2) (b). If both these issues (i) and (ii) are answered in the positive, then and then only he may proceed to inspection and recount of these votes mentioned in the petition. Similarly, after considering the legal questions indicated above, he may order recount of the 9 votes alleged to have counterfoils attached thereto. There appears to be no justification for ordering a general inspection of the ballots on the facts of this case. The learned Judge shall proceed with the trial of the election petition in the light of what has been said above. Costs to abide the event in the High Court. P.H.P. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 128 of 1962. Appeal from the judgment and order dated January 30, 1962, of the Calcutta High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 429 of 1960. section C. Mazumdar, for the appellant. P. K. Chakravarti and P. K. Bose, for the respondent No. 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Wanchoo, J. This is an appeal on a certificate granted by the Calcutta High Court. The appellant hired a westing house, 399 D. C. motor from the Modem Electrical Works (hereinafter referred to as the Works) on April 4, 1958 on a rent of Rs. 40 per month. The hiring period was to last for at least three months and it was agreed that if the motor or parts thereof were lost or damaged by the appellant, he would be bound to pay the whole cost of the motor and the parts. The motor remained in the use of the appellant and hire charges were paid by him from April 1958 to January 1959. Thereafter it is said that no hire charges were paid. On June 8, 1959, the appellant wrote a letter to the Works in which he said that he had purchased the motor in question for Rs. 600 on condition that the same would be tried for three months, and if it was found satisfactory the money would be paid and the purchase completed. The letter also stated that the agreement was that if the motor was not found satisfactory, the appellant would pay three months ' hire at Rs. 40 per month and the motor would be returned thereafter. Finally, the appellant said in the letter that the Works had been paid Rs. 620 in all and thus the purchase had been completed. The appellant therefore requested the Works to give him a slip saying that the motor had been sold to the appellant, as no further money was due to the Works. On June 15, 1959, the Works sent a reply to the appellant denying that any such agreement as was alleged by the appellant had been made. It was also denied that Rs. 620 had been paid, and therefore the purchase was complete. Finally it was said that the appellant had only paid Rs. 400 and Rs. 200 were still due from him for the months of February to June 1959. The appellant replied to this letter in which he reiterated his stand taken in the earlier letter and gave details of how the payment of Rs. 620 had been made. Thereafter the Works filed a complaint through its servant Mohd. Ayub on July 1, 1959 in which after stating its case it urged that the appellant had committed criminal breach of trust and was therefore guilty under section 406 of the Indian Penal Code. On this complaint the appellant was summoned by the Presidency Magistrate 9th Court, Calcutta and after taking some evidence for the prosecution, the Magistrate discharged the appellant holding that there was no satisfactory evidence of dishonest misappropriation or conversion of the motor by the appellant to his own use and that the dispute between the parties was essentially of a civil nature. Mohd. Ayub then went in revision to the High Court. The High Court set aside the order of discharge and directed further enquiry in the matter by another Magistrate. The case then went back to the Third Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta, 400 who eventually found the appellant not guilty and ordered his acquittal on the ground that there was dispute between the parties as to the actual nature of the transaction and it could not be said that there was any dishonest intention on the part of the appellant to misappropriate the motor. Mohd. Ayub then filed an appeal before the High Court under section 417(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Eventually the matter was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court, and it came to the conclusion that it was clear from the letter of June 8, 1959 (to which we have already referred) that the same could not have been written unless the appellant dishonestly in violation of the entrustment wanted to cause wrongful loss to the complainant and wrongful gain to himself. It was further held that the letter did not show that there was a bona fide claim of ownership over the property and the claim was merely a pretence which could not exonerate the appellant from being punished under section 406 of the Indian Penal Code. 'The appellant then applied for a certificate to enable him to file an appeal to this Court, which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us. We are of the opinion that this appeal must succeed. It is not in dispute between the parties that the motor was entrusted to the appellant by the Works for his use. The dispute was whether this entrustment was merely by way of hire (which was the case of the Works) or, as was the case of the appellant, was on the basis of an agreement between the parties that the appellant would purchase the motor if he found it satisfactory after trying it for .three months and pay Rs. 600 as the price and that he would return it if he found it unsatisfactory during this period of three months and pay Rs. 40 each month as hire for that period. The real dispute between the parties therefore was as to the nature of the agreement between them when the motor was entrusted to the appellant in April 1958. That dispute was clearly of a civil nature. The Works however contended that by writing the letter of June 8, 1959 the appellant committed breach of trust and was guilty under section 406 of the Indian Penal Code. Now in that letter the appellant put forward his side of the case as to the terms of the agreement when he took delivery of the motor in April 1958. The question is whether by writing that letter the appellant could be said to have committed the offence defined in section 405 of the Indian Penal Code and punishable under section 406 thereof. Now section 405 runs as follows : 'Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly mis 401 appropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits criminal breach of trust.' It may be accepted that the appellant was entrusted with the motor by virtue of the agreement between him and the Works, the terms of which are seriously in dispute. The question however is whether the 'appellant dishonestly misappropriated or converted to his own use that motor. On the facts in the present case the motor was handed over to the appellant for his use even according to the case of the Works. Unless therefore it can be shown that the appellant by doing something to the motor which he was not entitled to do dishonestly misappropriated or converted the motor to his own use, he cannot be guilty of breach of trust under this part of section 405. Now the case of the Works is that the appellant must be deemed to have misappropriated or converted to his own use the motor by writing the letter of June 8th. It is clear however that the letter shows no change in the use of the motor, which, according to the Works, the appellant had hired for his own use. Therefore it cannot be said that merely by writing that letter of June 8, the appellant dealt with the motor in such manner as would amount to its misappropriation or conversion to his own use by him. Clearly the appellant was using the motor for his own purpose before that letter and continued to use it in the same way after the letter. That letter therefore cannot in our opinion result in the misappropriation or conversion of the motor to his own use by the appellant within the meaning of these words in section 405 in the circumstances of the present case. It is however urged that even if that be so, the appellant must be held to have dishonestly used or disposed of the motor in violation of the legal contract, express or implied, which he had made touching the discharge of such trust, because of the letter of June 8. Now it is clear from the receipt given by the appellant to the Works when he took the motor in April 1958 that he was taking it for his own use on certain terms. There is however nothing to show that by writing the letter of June 8 the appellant used the motor in violation of any legal contract, express or implied, which he bad made with respect to it for use of the motor was the same before the letter as well as after it. Nor can it be 402 said that the appellant had disposed of the motor in violation of any legal contract which he had made with respect thereto for it is not the case of the Works that the appellant had parted with the possession of the motor to somebody else. If, for example, the appellant had sold that motor, there might have been something to be said for the view that he had disposed of the motor in violation of the contract with respect to it even if it was a hirepurchase contract. But on the facts of this case all that the letter of June 8 does is to put forward the case of the appellant with respect to the transaction of April 4, 1958. So far as the use of the motor is concerned there has not been any change in it to indicate either misappropriation or conversion or disposal of it in any manner against the terms of the contract, express or implied. Clearly section 405 contemplates something being done with respect to the property which would indicate either misappropriation or conversion or its use or disposal in violation of the contract, express or implied. But where, as in the present case, nothing was done with respect to the use of the property which was not in accordance with the hiring agreement between the parties, it cannot be said that there was misappropriation or conversion of the property or its use or disposal in violation of the contract. We are not expressing any opinion as to the correctness of the case either of the appellant or of the Works in this behalf. All that we emphasise is that the letter of June 8 merely raises a ' dispute of civil nature between the parties and there is no question of any criminal breach of trust with respect to the motor on the basis of that letter. In this view of the matter we allow the appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant and order his acquittal. The fine, if paid. will be refunded to him. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal Nos. 1339 40 of 1988. From the judgment dated 7.7.1987 of the Madras High Court in W.P. Nos. 9781 and 10545 of 1986. G.L. Sanghi, P.P. Rao, R. Mohan, R. Perumal, V. Krishna murthy, M.N. Krishnamani, V. Sekhar, K.V. Vishwanathan, T. Raja, S.R. Setia, P. Chaudhary, A. Mariarputham and M.A. Krishnamurthy for the appearing parties. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J. In these appeals by special leave, the legality of the judgment of the Madras High Court dated 7 July 1987 quashing the promotions made to the cadre of professors in law colleges in the State of Tamil Nadu has been called into question. The appeals arise in the following circumstances: During the period from 1971 to 1982 the Government appointed temporary junior professors in different law colleges in the State. The appointments were made under Rule 10(a)(i)(1) of the Tamil Nadu State and SubOrdinate Services Rules, 1955 (Viz. Preliminary and The General Rules) (hereinafter called 'the Rules '). In 1979 the State Public Service Commission invited applications for regular appointment of junior professors. The temporary junior professors and others applied for the posts. The Public Service Commission selected 25 candidates out of whom 21 were already working as temporary junior professors. The selected candidates were arranged in the list called 'approved list '. ' in the order of merit. The list was prepared by the Public Service Commission on 16 August 1983. It was approved by the Government 'on 9 December 1983. On 27 June 1985 the State Government made an order regularising the services of those 21 junior professors. Their services were regularised with effect from the dates of original appointments as temporary junior professors. On 10 September 1986 some of the junior professors were promoted and appointed as professors in the law colleges. promotion was challenged before the Madras High Court on the ground that the claim of the seniors has been over looked ' It, was urged before the High Court that once the temporary services have been regularised retrospectively with effect from the date of entry in the service, the seniority should be reckoned by giving the benefit of regularised service notwithstanding the ranking in the approved list prepared by the Public Service Commission. The High Court accepted that plea and queshed the promotion of professors and directed the Government to make a proper order of promotion in the light of the views expressed in the judgment. The correctness of the judgment of the High Court has been assailed in these appeals. We must first outline the necessary statutory provisions bearing on the question raised. Section 10(a)(i)(1) provides as follows: '10. Temporary appointments: (a)(i)(1) Where it is necessary in the public interest owing to an emergency which has arisen to fill immediately a vacancy in a post borne on the cadre of a service, class or category and there would be undue delay in making such appointment in accordance with these rules and the Special Rules, the appointing authority may temporarily appoint a person, otherwise than in accordance with the said rules. Rule 22 so far as relevant reads: 'Reservation of Appointments Where the Special Rules lay down that the principle of reservation of appointments shall apply to any service, class or category, selection for appointment thereto shall with effect on and from the 7th June 197.1, in cases such selection is made by the Commission, and 8th November 1971, in other cases, be made on the following basis (a) The unit of selection for appointment, for the purpose of this rule, shall be one hundred, of which ,eighteen shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and thirty one shall be reserved for the Backward Classes and the remaining fifty one shall be filled on the basis of merit. (b) The claims Of members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the Backward Classes shall also be considered for the fifty one appointments, which shall be filled on the basis of merit; and where a candidate belonging to a Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or Backward Class is selected on the basis of merit, the number of posts reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes or for the Backward Classes, as the case may be, shall not in any way be affected. Rule 23, so far. as material, is as follows: '23(a)(i) Date of Commencement of probation of persons first appointment temporarily If a person appointed temporarily either under sub rule (a) or sub rule. (d) of rule 10 to fill a vacancy in any service, class or category otherwise than in accordance with the rules governing appointment thereto, such vacancy being a vacancy which may be filled by direct recruitment, is subsequently appointed to the service, class or category in accordance with the rules, he shall commence his probation; if any, in such category either from the date of his first temporary appointment or from such subsequent date, as the appointing authority may determine. Provided that on the date so determined, the person possesses all the qualifications prescribed for appointment to the service, class or category, as the case may be. (ii) A person who commences probation under clause (i) shall also be eligible to draw increments in the time scale of pay applicable to him from the date of commencement of his probation. Where commencement of probation is ordered from a date earlier than the date of the order and if this has not been enabled by relaxation of any rule, he shall draw increments, including arrears, in the time scale Of pay applicable to him from such earlier date. The appointing authority shall include a provision to this effect while issuing orders in all such cases. Rule 35 omitting immaterial words, is in these terms: '35(a) The seniority of a person in a service, class or category or grade shall unless he has been reduced to a lower rank as a punishment, be determined by the rank obtained by him in the list of approved candidates drawn up by the T.N.P.S.C. or other appointing authority, as the case may be, subject to the rule of reservation. where it applies. The date of commencement of his probation shall be the date on which he joins duty irrespective of his seniority. ', It is under these Rules the Public Service Commission invited applications for selecting candidates for direct recruitment to the cadre of Assistant professors in Law. The Public Service Commission prepared the list of selected candidates by following the reservation provided under rule 22. The list was approved by the State Government. ' Rule 35(a) states that seniority of a person ' be determined by the rank 'obtained by him in the list of approved candidates drawn by the Public Service Commission subject to rule of reservation where it applies. The contention urged for the respondents, is. that since their temporary service as junior professors were regularised, the regularised service should count for the purpose of determining, their seniority and not the rankings in the select ,list approved by the Government. We find little substance in it. The order of regularisation is in these terms: 'ORDER DATED 27.6.1985 In G.O Ms. No. 2288 Education dated 9.12.1983 the Government approved the selection made by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission of the 25 candidates mentioned therein for appointment by direct recruitment as Junior Professor in the Tamil Nadu 'Legal Educational Service These 25 candidates were appointed temporarily as from their taking charge 'in G.O. Ms. No. 897 Education dated 11.7. The Government have however, decided to appoint them, regularly with effect from, the dates on which, they were declared fully qualified to hold the post of Junior professor in the Law Colleges in Tamil Nadu prior to their selection by the Tamil. Public. Service. Commission and appointment as Junior ,Professors,in Law Colleges with reference to their selection. The Government accordingly direct that the services of the 21 individuals mentioned in the Annexure to this order as Junior Professors in the Tamil Nadu Legal Educational Service, be regularised with retrospective effect from the dates noted against them. The inter se seniority of the 21 candidates.indicated in the annexure is in accordance with the seniority fixed by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission. The inter se seniority position will not be affected in any way with reference to the dates 'of regularisation mentioned in column 3 of the annexure. Under Rule 23(a)(ii) of the General Rules for State and Subordinate Services, the incumbents are eligible for increments from the date of their regularisation as they are fully qualified to hold the post on that date. The increments already sanctioned to them, for their services as temporary. junior professors prior to regular appointment, is ratified. The first paragraph of the order refers to the selection of 25 candidates by the Public Service Commission for appointment as Junior Professors in the law colleges and their appointment with effect from their ' taking charges. The second paragraph of the order deals with the regularisation of the services of/21 candidates out of 25 appointed. The Government directed that the services of the 21 Junior Professors specified in the order be regularised with retrospective effect from the date noted against them. In the third paragraph it is stated that the inter se seniority of the 21 candidates is in accordance with the seniority fixed by the Public Service Commission and the inter se seniority position will not be affected in any way with reference to the dates of regularisation of their services. The paragraph four of the order deals with the rights of the candidates to draw increments under rule 23(a)(ii) in the service rendered as temporary Junior Professors. The High Court has stated that Rule 35(a) could not have been properly invoked by the State Government after the regularisation of :he services of the candidates and it would be against the very concept of order of regularisation. It has been pointed out that by regularisation the period of temporary service has been converted into a period of regular service and a deeming, fiction is introduced that the candidates whose services have been regularised retrospectively must be treated for all purposes as being in regular service from the respective dates of regularisation. In our opinion, the view. expressed by the. High Court not only runs counter to the terms of the order of the. regularisation but also is inconsistent with Statutory principle of determining seniority under Rule 35(a). In the first place the order of regularisation of the services 'of the candidates expressly states that the inter se seniority of, the candidates would be in accordance with the rankings in the approved list prepared by the Public Service Commission and will not be affected in any way by the date of regularisation of services. When the ' order of regularisation of temporary service itself denies such service for the purpose of determining seniority, the Court cannot count that service for the purpose of seniority. Secondly, Rule 3.5(a) provides for determining the inter se seniority of the candidates selected by the Public Service Commission. It states that the seniority of a person in a service, class or category or trade shall be determined unless he has been reduced to a lower rank as a punishment, by the rank obtained by him in the list of approved candidates drawn by the Public Service Commission or other appointing authority as the case may be '. Since the parties in these cases appeared for selection before the Public Service Commission for regular recruitment as Junior Professors, the list of approved candidates prepared by the Public Service Commission in the order.of merit and accepted by the Government should be the basis for determining their inter se seniority. It is not open to the parties to claim that their temporary service as Junior Professors upon regularisation should be counted for the purpose of determining the seniority in the cadre. There is no rule supporting such contention. The services rendered in the temporary post is available either for earning increments or for commencement of probation. That would be clear from Rule 23(a). Consistent with the Rule 23(a), the Government in the order of regularisation has directed that the incumbents are eligible for increments from the date of their regularisation as they are fully qualified to hold the post on that date. The increments already sanctioned to them during their services as temporary Junior Professors prior to.regular appointment has been ratified by the said order. The High Court was plainly in error in ignoring the statutory Rules and the terms and conditions of the order of regularisation of services. Apart from that, Rule 10(a)(i)(1) provides for making of temporary appointments when it is necessary in the public interest to do so owing to an emergency which has arisen for filling a vacancy immediately. Such appointments are made otherwise than in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Rules. In the instant case the respondents were appointed temporarily and otherwise than in accordance with 'the Rules. They were later selected along with others for direct ,recruitment.by the Public Service Commission. They were not entitled to count their temporary service for seniority. In A.P.M. Mayakutty etc, vs Secretary, Public Service Department etc., at 942 this Court observed that the services rendered by the applicants under Rule 10(a)(i)(1) cannot be considered for the purpose of seniority as such appointment is a matter of stop gap, emergency or fortuitous arrangement. The present case cannot ' be an exception to this principle even though their temporary services have been regularised, since regularisation 'was only for limited purposes. In any view of the matter the decision of the High Court cannot be sustained. In the result the appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment is set aside with no order as to costs. V.P.R. Appeals allowed.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 240 of 1960. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 25, 1958, of the Punjab High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 114 of 1954. Jai Gopal Sethi, C. L. Sareen and R. L. Kohli, for the appellant. N. section Bindra, R. H. Dhebar and D. Gupta, for respondent. August 30. The Judgement of the Court was delivered by SARKAR, J. The appellant Payare Lal was the Tehsildar of Patiala. He and Bishan Chand, a Patwar clerk of the Tehsil Office, were prosecuted for offences under s.5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (Act XLVI of 1952), to which it will be convenient hereafter to refer as the Act, required the trial to be held by a special Judge appointed under it and in accordance with certain provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure mentioned in section 8 of the Act. The Principal question in this appeal turns on the construction of sub section (1) of this section which we will later set out. The trial commenced before section Narinder Singh the special Judge, Patiala. He heard the evidence but before he could deliver a judgment he was transferred and was succeeded by section Jagjit Singh. section Jagjit Singh did not recall the witnesses and hear the evidence over again, but proceeded without any objection from either side, with the trial from the stage at which his predecessor had left it and having heard the arguments of the advocates for the parties, delivered his judgment convicting both the accused of the offences with which they had been charged and passed certain sentences on them. The accused appealed against their conviction to the High Court of Punjab. The appeals came to be heard by Mehar Singh J., who, though no point had been taken by the accused, himself felt considerable difficulty as to whether section Jagjit Singh had the power to decide the case on the evidence recorded by his predecessor and referred the matter to a larger bench taking the view that if the course followed was defective, the defect would be one of jurisdiction of the Court and could not be cured by the consent of parties. The case was thereupon heard by a bench of that High Court constituted by Gurnam Singh and Mehar Singh JJ. who took different views. Gurnam Singh J. held that section 350 of the Code applied to the trial before a special Judge in view of section 8(1) of the Act and under the terms of section 350, which we will later set out, section Jagjit Singh was entitled to proceed on the evidence recorded by his predecessor section Narinder Singh, while Mehar Singh J., was of the opinion that section 8(1) of the Act did not make section 350 of that Code applicable to such a trial. He also held that what section Jagjit Singh had done was not a mere irregularity curable under section 537 of the Code. The matter was then referred to Passey J., who agreed with Gurnam Singh J. On the question of section 537 of the Code, Gurnam Singh and Passey JJ. expressed no opinion in the view that they had taken of section 8(1) of the Act. The appeals were thereafter heard on the merits by Tek Chand J. who upheld the conviction of the appellant but reduced the sentence passed on him. He, however, acquitted the other accused Bishan Chand giving him the benefit of doubt. The appellant has now come up to this Court in further appeal with special leave. There is no appeal by the State against the acquittal of Bishan Chand. There is no controversy that the general principle of law is that a judge or magistrate can decide a case only on evidence taken by him. Section 350 of the Code is a statutory departure from this principle. That section so far as material was at the date section Jagjit Singh decided the case in these terms: section 350. Whenever any Magistrate, after having heard and recorded the whole or any part of the evidence in an inquiry or a trial, ceases to exercise jurisdiction therein, and is succeeded by another Magistrate who has and who exercises such jurisdictions, the Magistrate so succeeding may act on the evidence so recorded by his predecessor, or partly recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by himself or he may resummon the witnesses and recommence the inquiry or trial It is only if this provision was available to section Jagjit Singh that the course taken by him can be supported. As we have said earlier, section 8 of the Act makes certain provisions of the Code applicable to the proceedings before a special Judge The question is whether section 350 of the Code was one of such provisions. The answer to this question will depend on the construction of sub ss.(1) and (3) of section 8 of the Act the material portions of which we now set out. section 8 (1) A special judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial, and in trying the accused persons, shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates. (3) Save as provided in sub section (1) . the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, shall, so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act, apply to the proceedings before a special Judge; and for the purposes of the said provisions, the Court of the special judge shall be deemed to be a Court of session trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors. . . . In substance these sub sections provide that a special Judge shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates and save to this extent, the provision of the Code applicable to a Court of session, shall govern him as if he were such a Court subject to certain qualifications which are not relevant for the present case. There is no controversy that section 350 of the Code is applicable only to magistrates and not a Court of session and cannot therefore be applied to a special Judge under sub section (3) as it makes only those provisions of the Code applicable to him which would apply to a Court of session. The only controversy is whether that section is applicable to a special Judge under sub s.(1) of section 8 of the Act. If it is so applicable, it must be applied though under sub section (3) it is not applicable, for this sub section, is to have effect 'Save as provided in subsection (1)'. The real question is, what is meant by the words 'the procedure prescribed by the Code . . . for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates' In section 8(1) of the Act? Does section 350 of the Code prescribe one of the rules of such procedure? It is necessary however to point out that by an amendment made in the Act after judgment had been delivered in this case by section Jagjit Singh, it has been expressly provided that section 350 of the Code applies to the proceedings before a special Judge. On the amended Act, therefore, the question that has arisen in this case, would no longer arise. For reasons to be hereafter stated, this amendment clearly does not govern the proceedings before section Jagjit Singh and this case has to be decided without reference to the amendment. Is was once held by the Madras High Court in In re, Vaidyanatha Iyer (1) that section 350 of the Code prescribed a rule of procedure for the trial of warrant cases as mentioned in section 8 (1) of the Act. This seems to be the only reported decision taking that view. All other decisions which have been brought to our notice take the contrary view. Even in Madras, in In re Fernandez (2), a Full Bench of the High Court has now hold that section 350 of the Code was not applicable to a special Judge and has overruled In re Vaidyanatha Iyer (1). That appears to be the position on the authorities. It is true that section 350 of the Code is a provision applying to all magistrates and therefore, also to a magistrate trying a warrant case. That however does not in our opinion decide the question. We think it relevant to observe that it is a right of an accused person that his case should be decided by a judge who has heard the whole of it and we agree with the view expressed in Fernandez’s case(2) (1) ; A.I.R. (1954) Mad. (2) that very clear words would be necessary to take away such an important and well established right. We find no such clear words here. We turn now to the word used. When sub section (1) of section 8 of the Act talks of a procedure prescribed by the Code for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates it is reasonable to think that it has the provisions and the language of the Code in view. When we look at the Code, we find that ch. XXI is headed 'of the Trial of Warrant Cases by Magistrates'. This chapter consists of sections 251 to 259. Section 251 is in these terms: section 251 In the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates, the Magistrate shall, (a) in any case instituted on a police report, follow the procedure specified in section 251A; and (b) in any other case, follow the procedure specified in the other provisions of this Chapter. The Code, therefore, expressly refers to sections 251 259 as containing the procedure specified for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates; this then, is the procedure it prescribes for the trial of such cases. It would be legitimate, therefore, to think that the Act in using the words 'procedure prescribed by the Code for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates' also meant only these sections of the Code and did not contemplate section 350 of the Code as a procedure so prescribed, though that section is applicable to the proceedings before a magistrate trying a warrant case. It does not seem to us that the words 'the procedure prescribed by the Code for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates' meant a procedure which may be followed by magistrates in all cases. Furthermore section 350 occurs in a chapter of the Code which deals with general provisions relating to inquiries and trials and is not a provision which has been specifically prescribed by the Code for application to the trial of warrant cases by magistrates, as are sections 251 to 259. Again, section 350 of the Code cannot, without doing violence to the language used in it, be applied to the proceedings before a special Judge Clearly it cannot be applied where its terms make such application impossible. Now the section can be applied only when one magistrate succeeds another. It lays down what the succeeding magistrate can do. Now suppose one special Judge succeeds another. How can he exercise the powers conferred by the section? The section applies only when the predecessor is a magistrate. The predecessor in the case assumed is however a special Judge. Such a Judge is not a magistrate for the purpose of the Act, nor does the Act require that he is to be deemed to be such. Section 8 (1) of the Act which only requires a special Judge to follow the procedure for the trial of a warrant case, cannot justify the creation of a fiction making the predecessor special Judge, a magistrate. It is of some interest to note here that the amendment to the Act which expressly makes section 350 of the Code applicable to proceedings before a special Judge also provides that for the purposes of so applying the section, 'a special Judge shall be deemed to be a magistrate'. Clearly, the legislature thought that unless such a fiction was created, the application of the section to the proceedings before a special Judge would create difficulties or anomalies. Therefore also, the Act could not in our view, have intended that section 350 of the Code would be available to a special Judge as a rule of procedure prescribed for the trial of warrant cases. For all these reasons, we would prefer the opinion expressed by Mehar Singh J. We think that under the Act, as it stood before its amendment as aforesaid, section 350 of the Code was not available when one special Judge succeeded another. We hold that section Jagjit Singh had no authority under the law to proceed with the trial of the case from the stage at which section Narinder Singh left it. The conviction by section Jagjit Singh of the appellant cannot be supported as he had not heard the evidence in the case himself The proceedings before him were clearly incompetent. It is then said that this defect was a mere irregularity and the conviction of the appellant can, if sustainable on the evidence, be upheld under section 537 of the Code. In regard to this section, it was said by the Privy Council in Pulukuri Kotayyam vs King Emperor (1), 'When a trial is conducted in a manner different from that prescribed by the Code (as in N. A. Subramania Iyer’s case, 1901 L.R. 28 I.A. 257), the trial is bad, and no question of curing an irregularity arises but if the trial is conducted substantially in the manner prescribed by the Code, but some irregularity occurs in the course of such conduct, the irregularity can be cured under section 537, and none the less so because the irregularity involves, as must nearly always be the case, a breach of one or more of the very comprehensive provisions of the Code'. It seems to us that the case falls within the first category mentioned by the Privy Council. This is not a case of irregularity but want of competency. Apart from section 350 which, as we have said, is not applicable to the present case, the Code does not conceive of such a trial. The trial offends the cardinal principle of law earlier stated, the acceptance of which by the Code is clearly manifest from the fact that the Code embodies an exception to that principle in section 350. Therefore, we think that section 537 of the Code has no application. It cannot be called in aid to make what was incompetent, competent. There has been no proper trial of the case and there should be one. Then it is said on behalf of the appellant that we should not send the case back for a fresh trial but decide it ourselves on the evidence on the record. Coming from the appellant, it is a somewhat surprising contention. According to him, a point which we have accepted, there has really been no proper trial of the case. It would follow from this that there has to be one. In the absence of such a trial we cannot even look at the evidence on the record. Lastly, we have to say a few words on the amendment of the Act expressly making section 350 of the Code applicable to the proceedings before a special Judge. The amendment came long after the decision of the case by section Jagjit Singh and had not expressly been made retrospective. It was said on behalf of the respondent, the prosecutor, that the amendment being in a procedural provision was necessarily retrospective, and, therefore, no exception can now be taken to the action taken by section Jagjit Singh. Assuming that the rule contained in section 350 of the Code is only a rule of procedure, all that would follow would be that it would be presumed to apply to all actions pending as well as future: Kimbray vs Draper (1). Such a retrospective operation does not assist the respondent’s contention. Nor do we think it an argument against sending the case back for retrial that the special Judge now hearing the case would be entitled to proceed on the evidence recorded by section Narinder Singh in view of the amendment. Whether he would be entitled to do so or not would depend on whether the amended Act would apply to proceedings commenced before the amendment. It has to be noted that the impugned part of the proceedings was concluded before the amendment. On this question, we do not propose to express any opinion. In any event, under section 350 as it now stands a succeeding magistrate has power to resummon and examine a witness further. We cannot speculate what the special Judge who tries the case afresh will think fit to do if section 350 of the Code is now applicable to the proceedings before him. For all these considerations, we think it fit to send the case back for retrial. We therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the conviction of the appellant and the sentence passed on him. The case will now go back for retrial According to law.",

        "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 225 of 1978. From the Judgment and order dated 19.4.1978 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1106 of 1974. A.N. Mulla, Mrs. Pravawati, Mrs. Urmila Kapur and Ms. section Janani for the Appellants. R.S. Sodhi for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BALAKRISHNA ERADI, J. After hearing Shri A.N. Mulla, Sr. Advocate for appellants and Shri R.S. Sodhi, Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent and having carefully examined all aspects of the case in the light of the submissions made at the Bar, we have unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that this appeal has to be allowed. 749 The four appellants before us Tota Singh, Dauli Singh, Mithu Singh and Mukhtiar Singh were tried by the Court of Sessions, Faridkot on charges under Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 IPC and Section 323 IPC read with Section 34 IPC. After detailed consideration of the entire evidence adduced in the case, the learned Sessions Judge by his judgment dated May 30, 1974 acquitted the appellants of all the charges laid against them. Against the said decision of the Sessions Judge, the State of Punjab preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1106 of 1974 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. A Division Bench of the High Court by its judgment dated April 9, 1978 allowed the State 's appeal, set aside the order of the Sessions acquitting the appellants and convicted the appellants under Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 IPC as well as under Section 323 1PC read with Section 34 IPC. On the first count all the appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and on the second account they were ordered to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year each with a further direction that the substantive sentence of imprisonment in respect of all the appellants shall run concurrently. We do not propose to set out in extenso the facts of the case nor to discuss in detail the oral and documentary evidence adduced. We say this for the reason that we are fully satisfied that the approach made by the High Court to a consideration of the appeal was wholly vitiated by a manifest illegality inasmuch as the High Court has acted in total disregard of the principles repeatedly laid down by this Court delineating the restricted grounds on which alone interference may be made by a Court of appeal with an order of acquittal passed by a lower Court. The occurrence that led to the prosecution took place on July 19, 1973 at about 4 P.M. in village Bishmandi, Police Station Jaitu in District Faridkot. The case of the prosecution is that the deceased Gurdev Singh accompanied by Ajmer Singh P.W. 2 and Malkiat Singh P.W. 6 was going from the house of the Ajmer Singh to the house of the deceased on that fateful day. While they were approaching the house of one Moda Singh Jat, the four appellants, all carrying a gandasa each, suddenly besieged them from behind the Cheli anwali Street raising a 'lalkara' proclaiming that they were going to take their revenge for outraging the modesty of Malkiat Kaur and they attacked the deceased as well as Ajmer Singh and Malkiat Singh by inflicting gandasa blows on them. It was alleged that this was a preplanned and concerted attack made by the appellants as a reprisal for an incident of alleged rape of one Malkiat Kaur by Ajmer Singh 750 (P.W. 2). Gurdev Singh (deceased) is said to have fallen down on the spot as a result of the blows inflicted on him and P.Ws. 2 and 6 are said to have suffered simple injuries due to the attack with gandasa. According to the prosecution version on hearing the cries for help raised by P.W. 2 and P.W. 6, Kaur Singh, son of deceased Gurdev Singh came to the place of occurrence and thereupon all the four appellants ran away from the spot leaving P.W. 6 near Gurdev Singh, who was lying on the ground in an injured condition. P.W. 2 is said to have gone to the Sarpanch and the Panch of the village and informed them about the incident. Thereafter he returned to the scene of occurrence and himself along with P.W. 6 are said to have put Gurdev Singh on a bullock cart and got him admitted in the injured condition in the hospital. P.W.2 and P.W.6 were also admitted in the same hospital. Gurdev Singh was subsequently transferred to the Christian Medical College at Ludhiana, where he succumbed to his injuries on July 30, 1973. The learned Sessions Judge after a careful analysis of all the facts and circumstances as disclosed by the evidence adduced in the case came to the conclusion that the testimony of Ajmer Singh P.W. 2 and Malkiat Singh P.W. 6 who were examined by the prosecution as eyewitnesses to prove the occurrence could not be safely accepted and acted upon as true. The trial Judge set out in his judgment detailed and cogent grounds for arriving at the said conclusion. In his opinion there was no proper explanation for the inordinate delay in reporting the crime to the police and there was also no adequate proof of any motive. The learned Sessions Judge rejected the theory put forward by the prosecution 'that it was a pre planned attack made by the appellants with a view to avenge the alleged molestation of Malkiat Kaur by Ajmer Singh P.W. 2 by pointing out that if such had been really the case, the target of attack by the appellants would have been Ajmer Singh to whom only simple injuries were caused and not Gurdev Singh who had nothing to do with the alleged incident of molestation. The learned Sessions Judge was inclined to accept the defence version that the appellants being 'siris ' had some dispute with P.W. 2 and P.W. 6 about the apportionment of 'batai ' and this might have led to their false implication in the case. In the absence of any independent corroboration of the testimony given by the two alleged eye witnesses (P.W. 2 and P.W. 6), the learned Sessions Judge who had seen them giving evidence in the box was not impressed by their evidence specially having regard to the fact that both of them had been appearing as prosecution witnesses in a large number of police cases. The testimony of P.W. 2 and P.W. 6 having been found to be not worthy of belief, the learned Sessions Judge acquitted the appellants on both the charges levelled against them. The High Court has not found in its judgment that the reasons given by the learned Sessions Judge for discarding the testimony of P.W. 2 and P.W. 6 were either unreasonable or perverse. What the High Court has done is to make an independent reappraisal of the evidence on its own and to set aside the acquittal merely on the ground that as a result of such reappreciation, the High Court was inclined to reach a conclusion different from the one recorded by the learned Sessions Judge. This Court has repeatedly pointed out that the mere fact that the Appellate Court is inclined on a reappreciation of the evidence to reach a conclusion which is at variance with the one recorded in the order of acquittal passed by the Court below will not constitute a valid and sufficient ground for setting aside the acquittal. The jurisdiction of the Appellate Court in dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal is circumscribed by the limitation that no interference is to be made with the order of acquittal unless the approach made by the lower Court to the consideration of the evidence in the case is vitiated by some manifest illegality or the conclusion recorded by the Court below is such which could not have been possibly arrived at by any Court acting reasonably and judiciously and is, therefore, liable to be characterised as perverse. Where two views are possible on an appraisal of the evidence adduced in the case and the Court below has taken a view which is a plausible one, the Appellate Court cannot legally interfere with an order of acquittal even it is of the opinion that the view taken by the Court below on its consideration of the evidence is erroneous. Tested in the light of the above principles, it must be held that the interference made in the present case by the High Court with the order of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge was wholly unwarranted. We accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the judgment and order of the learned Sessions Judge acquitting the appellants of all the charges framed against them. M.L.A. Appeal allowed.",

        "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 1041 of 1965. Appeal from the judgment and decree dated August 9, 1962 of the Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench, in Letters Patent Appeal No. 12 of 1961. section V. Natu and A. G. Ratnaparkhi, for the appellant. S.N. Kherdekar and M.R.K. Pillai, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, J. This appeal by certificate granted under article 133 (1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, in a Letters Patent appeal allowing the appeal and restoring the decree made in favour of the plaintiff Ganpatlal respondent before us and hereinafter called the respondent by the Trial Court as confirmed by the District Court. The facts relevant for the determination of the points raised before us are as follows: The respondent, Ganpatlal, was the owner of Field Survey No. 56, measuring 25 acres 4 gunthas, in Yeotmal District. It appears that the respondent used to lease the land to the defendant Dewaji appellant before us and hereinafter called the appellant on yearly lease. For the year 1950 51 he gave the land to the appellant on the condition that at the end of the year the lease will stand determined and the appellant will hand over possession. On May 7, 1951, the respondent served a notice on the appellant requiring him to vacate the land in suit. The appellant however, continued to remain in possession. Thereupon the respondent filed a suit on September 17, 1951, praying for possession, damages and mesne profits. On November 15, 1951, the Berar Regulation of Agricultural Leases Act, 1951 (Madhya Pradesh No. XXIV of 1951) hereinafter called the 1951 Act came into force, section 16 of which provides as follows: 'Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no Civil Court shall entertain any suit instituted, or application made, to obtain a decision or order on any matter which a Revenue Officer is by or under this Act, empowered to determine, decide or dispose of.' One of the pleas which the appellant took was that he had been recorded as a 'protected tenant' under the 1951 Act and that the Civil Courts had no jurisdiction to eject him in view of section 8 of that Act. The Trial Court held that the appellant was not a protected tenant under section 3(3) of the 1951 Act and the Civil Court had jurisdiction. The appellant then appealed to the District Judge and the Additional District Judge held that the Civil Court had jurisdiction. He observed that 'there is nothing in this section (section 16 of the 1951 Act) to suggest that the powers of the Civil Court were in any way curtailed in regard to the question whether a particular person was a tenant or not under section 3 of the Act. Moreover, there is nothing in that Act to show that it was intended to apply to suits which were pending at the date when this Act came into force.' By the time the appeal was heard by the Additional District Judge, section 16 of the 1951 Act had been substituted by sections 16, 16A and 16B by the Berar Regulation of Agricultural Leases (Amendment) Act, 1953 hereinafter called the 1953 Act. These sections run as follows: '16(1) Whenever any question arises whether any transaction between a landholder and a person claiming to be his lessee is a lease within the meaning of this Act, such question shall be decided by the Revenue Officer. (2) In deciding the question referred to in subsection (1) the Revenue Officer shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act or in section 49 of the Indian Registration Act or in any other law for the time being in force, have power to inquire into and determine the real nature of the transaction and shall be at liberty, notwithstanding anything contained in any law as aforesaid to admit evidence of any oral agreement or a statement or unregistered document with a view to such determination. (3) Any decision of the Revenue Officer under this section shall be binding on the parties to the proceedings and persons claiming through them. 16A(1) Whenever any question as is referred to in section 16 arises before a Civil Court in any suit or proceeding, the Court shall, unless such question has already been determined by a Revenue Officer, refer the question to the Revenue Officer for decision and shall stay the suit or proceeding so far as it relates to the decision of such question. (2) The Civil Court shall accept the decision of the Revenue Officer on the question and decide the suit or proceeding before it accordingly. 16B: Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no Civil Court shall entertain any suit instituted, or application made, to obtain a decision or order on any matter which a Revenue Officer is by or under this Act, empowered to determine, decide or dispose of.' Before the Additional District Judge the appellant relied on these sections and asserted that the determination of the question whether a person is a tenant or not was, under the 1953 Act, a matter entirely within the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts had been ousted. The learned Additional District Judge repelled the argument and held that the 1953 Act did not affect pending proceedings. The learned Additional District Judge thereupon dismissed the appeal. The appellant then appealed to the High Court. The appeal first came up for hearing before Vyas, J. By an order dated August 21, 1957, he held that in view of the amendments made by the 1953 Act, 'it is not for the Civil Court to decide but for the Revenue Officer to determine whether in the year 1951 52 also the defendant was paying to his landlord every week by way of rent one third share in the produce of the garden and was his lessee for that year also.' He further observed that 'if the answer to this question is in the affirmative, the defendant would be entitled to all the benefits of a protected tenancy, as observed by the learned Chief Justice in Paika vs Rajeshwar.' In the result he set aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned Additional District Judge and directed 'that the record and proceedings in this case be sent to the Revenue Officer that is, the SubDivisional Officer, Yeotmal, and the said Revenue Officer is directed to decide whether the defendant’s averment is right or otherwise, namely, that even after the expiry of the year 1950 51, that is, even after 31st March, 1951, the defendant used to pay to his landlord, the plaintiff, every week by way of rent one third share in the produce of the garden. The decision of the Revenue Officer shall be subject to the usual course of appeal and revision, and when the question which is referred to the Revenue Officer by this judgment is finally decided by the highest Revenue Authority, the finding shall be communicated to this Court. Until such time that this Court receives a finding upon the question mentioned above from the highest Revenue Authority, this appeal shall stand stayed. It shall be disposed of by this Court after the finding of the highest Revenue Authority is received by it.' The Revenue Court then remitted the finding. The Commissioner, which was the last Revenue Court, gave a finding confirming the one as given by the Sub Divisional Officer that the appellant was paying rent to the respondent for the year 1951 52. The appeal was then heard by Badkas, J. It was argued before him that Vyas, J., should not have referred the issue to the Revenue Officer for decision under section 16 of the 1951 Act, but Badkas, J., held that it would not be appropriate for him to sit in judgment over the decision given by Vyas, J., and that the reference made by Vyas, J., under section 16 of the 1951 Act had to be accepted. Accepting the finding of the Revenue Courts, Badkas, J., held that the respondent was not entitled to eject the appellant. He further held that it was not necessary to decide whether the 1951 Act was retrospective or not as the 1951 Act came into force during the year in which the defendant held survey numbers in question as lessee. He accordingly allowed the appeal. Having obtained leave, the respondent appealed under the Letters Patent. It was urged before the Letters Patent Bench on behalf of the appellant that the Bench could not deal with the question whether the 1953 Act applied to pending proceedings on the ground that this point had not been argued before the learned Single Judge. The Bench found no substance in this contention as the point had been raised before the learned Single Judges. The Bench further held that there was no bar to the question of applicability of the 1953 Act being allowed to be raised. Dealing with the merits, the Bench held that 'taking the scheme of the Act into account and the fact that there is no section in the Act which makes the Act applicable to pending proceedings, it is at once clear that it was not intended to affect pending proceedings. Pending proceedings must continue unaffected by the provision of the Act and whatever questions arose in those proceedings must be decided by the Civil Courts.' The Bench then accepting the finding of the Civil Courts, held that there was no defence to the suit and the suit must succeed. The Bench also repelled the argument that it was not open to reconsider the entire merits of the Second Appeal as the leave had been given by Badkas, J., and not by Vyas, J. The Bench observed that there was no substance in the contention since the judgment of Vyas, J., was never open to the appeal it being an interlocutory judgment. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that sections 16, 16A and 16B, as substituted by the 1953 Act, had clearly ousted the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts and Vyas, J, was right in sending the case to Revenue Courts for decision on the question whether the appellant was a tenant in the year 1951 52 or not. He stresses the word 'whenever' appearing in section 16 and says that this is a wide word and no limitation can be placed on it. In our view there is no substance in this contention. The first point to be noticed in this connection is that the 1953 Act came into force after the Trial Court had decreed the suit and an appeal was pending before the District Judge. It cannot be disputed that if the Legislature intends to oust the jurisdiction of Civil Courts, it must say so expressly or by necessary implication. We cannot find any words in sections 16, 16A and 16B which can lead to the necessary inference that these provisions were intended to apply to appeals pending when the 1953 Act came into force. It is true that the word 'whenever' is wide but section 16A uses the words 'suit or proceeding' and these words do not ordinarily indicate appellate proceedings. Further, section 16B uses the word 'entertain' and not the words 'entertain or try any suit' as contained in section 15(2) of the 1951 Act. If the intention was to affect pending proceedings, the word 'try' alongwith the word 'entertain' would have been used in section 16B of the 1953 Act. It seems to us that the intention was not to apply the 1953 Act to pending appeals. If sections 16A and 16B do not bar the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts in this case the Letters Patent Bench was right in accepting the findings given by the Trial Court and the District Court in holding that the appellant was not a tenant for the year 1951 52. The learned counsel then contends that it was not open to the Letters Patent Bench to decide this question of the applicability of sections 16, 16A and 16B because Vyas, J., had decided to the contrary and had not given leave to appeal against his order. It seems to us that the order of Vyas, J, was interlocutory and it was not necessary for the respondent to obtain separate leave to appeal against this order. It was open to the Letters Patent Bench to decide all points decided by Vyas, J., in the interlocutory order dated August 21, 1957. At any rate the same point was raised before Badkas, J. Further as held by this Court in Satyadhyan Ghosal vs Sm. Deorajin Devi, 'an interlocutory order which did not terminate the proceedings and which had not been appealed from either because no appeal lay or even though an appeal lay an appeal was not taken, could be challenged in an appeal from the final decree or order.' Section 105(2), C.P.C., does not apply in this case, and therefore, the Letters Patent Bench was entitled to go into the validity of the order passed by Vyas, J. The learned counsel then urges that this was a new point and the Letters Patent Bench should not have allowed it to be taken. But we agree with the Bench that the point had been raised before the learned Single Judges. In view of this it is not necessary to decide whether a new point can be taken up in a Letters Patent appeal or not. In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. V.P.S. Appeal dismissed.",

        "judgement": "Writ Petitions Nos. 114 and 115 of 1961. Petition under article 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of Fundamental Rights. M. K. Nambiar, M. K. Govind Bhatt, S. N. Andley, and Rameshwar Nath, for the petitioners. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney General of India, K. K. Mathew, Advocate General for the State of Kerala, Sardar Bahadur, George Pudissary and V. A. Seyid Muhammad, for the respondents. December 5. The Judgment of Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo and Das Gupta, JJ., was delivered by Wanchoo, J. Sarkar, J. and Ayyangar, J. delivered separate Judgment. WANCHOO, J. These two writ petitions which were heard along with Purushothaman Nambudiri vs The State of Kerala (1) raise the constitutionality of the Kerala Agrarian Relations Act, No. IV of 1961 hereinafter referred to as the Act. The petitioners come from that part of the State of Kerala which was formerly in the South Canara district of the State of Madras and came to the State of Kerala by the State Reorganisation Act of 1956. Their lands are situate in Hosdrug and Kasargod Taluks which have now been made part of the Cannanore District in the State of Kerala. They hold large areas of lands, the major part of which is held by them as ryotwari pattadars, of Madras under the Board’s Standing Orders of that State. In these lands they have areca and pepper plantations besides rubber plantations. They also grow other crops on some of the lands. The Act is being attacked on the ground that it contravenes articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution. Besides this, it is also contended on behalf of the petitioners that the Bill which became the Act lapsed under the provisions of the Constitution, and therefore the assent given to the Bill by the President was of no effect and did not result in the Bill becoming an Act. We do not think it necessary to set out the details of the attack on this last score in the present petitions as the matter has been considered in full in the judgment in the connected Writ Petition No. 105 of 1961. The petitioners further submit that their lands which they hold as ryotwari pattadars are not estates within the meaning of article 31A(2)(a) of the Constitution and therefore the Act so far as it affects them is not protected under article 31A, and it is open to them to assail it as violative of the rights conferred on them by articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution. They have attacked the Act on a number of grounds as ultra vires the Constitution in view of the provisions of articles 14, 19 and 31. We do not however think it necessary to detail all the attacks on the constitutionality of the Act for present purposes. It is enough to say that the main attack on the constitutionality of the Act has been made on the following six grounds: (1) The Bill which became the Act had lapsed before it was assented to by the President and therefore the assent of the President to a lapsed bill was of no avail to turn it into law. (2) The Act is a piece of colourable legislation as it has made certain deductions from the compensation payable to landholders under Chap. II and to others who held excess land under Chap. III and this amounts to acquisition of money by the State which it is not competent to do under the power conferred on it in Lists II and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. (3) The properties of the petitioners who are ryotwari pattadars are not estates within the meaning of article 31A of the Constitution and therefore the Act is not protected under that Article so far as it applies to lands of ryotwari pattadars like the petitioners. (4) The Act exempts plantations of tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom from certain provisions thereof, but no such exemption has been granted to plantations of areca and pepper, and this is clearly discriminatory and is violative of article 14. (5) The manner in which ceiling is fixed under the Act results in discrimination and is therefore violative of article 14. (6) The compensation which is payable under Chapters II and III of the Act has been reduced by progressive cuts as the amount of compensation increases and this amounts to discrimination between persons similarly situate and is therefore violative of article 14. The petitions have been opposed on behalf of the State and its contention is, firstly, that the Bill did not lapse and the President’s assent was rightly given to it and it rightly became law; secondly, that the petitioners’ estates lands are estates within the meaning of article 31A(2)(a) and the Act is therefore protected under that Article; thirdly, that the Act is not a piece of colourable legislation and the State Legislature was competent to enact the Act under item 18 of List II and item 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule and there is no acquisition of money by the state under the Act and reference is made to section 80 of the Act in this connection; and lastly, that the discrimination alleged with respect to plantations, the fixation of ceiling and the deductions from compensation payable under Chapters II and III is really no discrimination at all and the provisions in that behalf are based on an intelligible differentia which is in accordance with the object and purpose of the Act. The question whether the Bill which finally received the assent of the President on January 21, 1961, had lapsed because the legislative assembly which originally passed it was dissolved and a new legislative assembly which came into being after the general elections reconsidered and repassed it under article 201 of the Constitution has been considered by us in Writ Petition No. 105 of 1961, judgment in which has just been delivered and it has been held there that the bill did not lapse and therefore it validly became law when the President assented to it. The attack on the Act therefore on this ground must fail. We now come to the attack made on the Act on the ground that it is a piece of colourable legislation beyond the legislative competence of the State legislature. What is colourable legislation is now well settled: see K. C. Gajapati Narayan Deo vs The State of Orissa (1), where it was held “that the question whether a law was a colourable legislation and as such void did not depend on the motive or bona fides of the legislature in passing the law but upon the competency of the legislature to pass that particular law, and what the courts have to determine in such cases is whether though the legislature has purported to act within the limits of its powers, it has in substance and reality transgressed those powers, the transgression being veiled by what appears, on proper examination, to be a mere pretence or disguise. The whole doctrine of colourable legislation is based upon the maxim that you cannot do indirectly what you cannot do directly. The Act has been passed under the legislative powers vested in the State legislature under item 18 of List II and item 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule. Item 18 of List II deals inter alia with “land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents”. Item 42 of list III deals with “acquisition and requisitioning of property.” The contention on behalf of the petitioners is that in the guise of legislating under these two entries the State legislature by the employment of certain devices has taken away money, which should have gone to landowners or to those from whom excess lands were being acquired. The attack is based on the facts that in section 52 of the Act compensation payable to a landowner is reduced after the purchase price to be paid by the tenant to whom the land is to be assigned has been ascertained, and that in section 64 of the Act the compensation payable to a person from whom excess land is taken is reduced by certain percentage after the market value of the land has been determined. It is urged that by these devices the State is acquiring money which should properly have gone to the landowner to whom compensation is payable under section 52 and to the person who surrenders excess land to whom compensation is payable under section 64. There is no doubt that certain deductions are made from the purchase price payable by the tenant under section 45 and from the market value before compensation is arrived at for payment to the landowner under section 52 and to the person surrendering excess land under section 64. But if one looks at the purpose and object of the Act it will be clear that the main provisions of the Act are clearly within the legislative competence of the State legislature under item 18 of List II and item 42 of List III. The scheme of the Act so far as Chap. II dealing with extinction of the landowner’s right is concerned is that the landowner’s right vested in the State under sections 41 and 42 on a day to be notified by the Government in that behalf. Thereafter, section 43 provides that cultivating tenants of the lands which have vested in the State shall have a right to assignment of the right, title and interest so vested in the State on payment of a certain price which is calculated under section 45 and is called the purchase price. After the purchase price is determined, the compensation to be paid to the landowner is provided by section 52 and there is reduction in the purchase price for the purpose of giving compensation. It is however obvious that the object of Chap. II is to vest proprietorship in the land in the cultivating tenants and for that purpose Chap. II provides for carrying out the object in two stages. In the first stage, the property of the landowner is vested in the State. Thereafter the tenant is given the right to acquire that property from the State. What price the tenant is to pay for the land is worked out under section 45, and what compensation the State is to pay to the landowner is worked out under section 52, which however reduces the purchase price arrived at under section 45 for the purpose of giving compensation. It is however clear that tenants are not bound to apply to acquire the land which they hold as tenants and where they do not do so, section 44(3) provides that they become the tenants of Government and shall be liable to pay to the Government the rent payable in respect of the land from the date on which the right, title and interest over the land vested in the Government. It cannot therefore be said that the scheme which provides for two stages, namely, first acquisition by Government and secondly assignment to tenants is a camouflage devised for the purpose of taking away the money which would otherwise have been payable to the landowner in case the interest of the landowner was directly transferred to the cultivating tenants. It is also clear that there is bound to be a time lag between the acquisition under sections 41 and 42 and the assignment to tenants under section 43 and the subsequent sections and in the meantime the Government would be the owner of the rights acquired. Clearly, therefore Chap. II of the Act envisages first the acquirement of the landowner’s interest by the State for which compensation is payable under s.52. Thereafter the State will assign to such cultivating tenants as may apply the rights acquired by the State and there is likely to be an interval between the two transactions. Besides some cultivating tenants may not apply at all and that part of the property will remain with the State Government. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the scheme evolved in Chap. II is a device for taking away any part of the money to the landowner from the tenant to whom his interest may eventually be assigned. Besides the adequacy of compensation provided under section 52 for acquisition by the State of the interest of the landowner cannot be challenged on the ground that the compensation provided by the law is not adequate: See article 31(2). It is only because the compensation provided under section 52 is a percentage of the purchase price as calculated under section 45 that it appears as if the State is taking away a part of the compensation due to the landowner. Section 52 is however only a method for determining compensation and the whole compensation due to the landowner is to be found in section 52 and it cannot therefore be said that any part of the compensation is being taken away by the State. Similarly the scheme of Chap. III which provides a ceiling is that any land in excess of the ceiling shall vest in the Government under section 62. Thereafter the land so vested in Government can be assigned under section 70 to persons who do not possess any land or possess land less than 5 acres of double crop nilam or its equivalent. It is true that Government may assign the lands to those who apply under section 70 but it is not bound to do so and here again there will be a time lag between the vesting of the excess land in the Government under s.62 and its assignment to those who are eligible under section 70. The charge that in this Chapter there is a device for taking away the compensation due to the landowner is based on the fact that section 72 the person to whom the land is assigned under section 70 has to pay 55 per cent of the market value of the land while the person from whom the excess land is taken is not always paid 55 per cent of the market value, inasmuch as the percentage goes down to 25 per cent of the market value in certain circumstances. But here again the compensation is provided entirely under section 64 and it is that section which sets out the manner in which the compensation is to be provided. The adequacy of that compensation cannot be questioned in view of article 31(2). The fact that under sections 70 and 72 when the Government in its turn assigns land to those who are eligible for such assignment, a different percentage of market value is fixed would not make these provisions a device to take away the money due to those who surrender excess land. As we have already said the compensation to those who surrender excess land is all provided by section 64 and even if there is a difference between the price payable under section 72 by the assignee and the compensation payable to the landowner under section 64 that would not amount to taking away the money of the landowner by a device particularly when the assignment is bound to take place sometime after the property has been acquired by Government. It is also clear from the provisions contained in Chapters II and III of the Act that the main purpose of the Act is to do away with intermediaries and to fix a ceiling and give the excess land, if any, to the landless or those who hold land much below the ceiling. The method employed to carry out this object is first to acquire the land for the State and thereafter to assign it to the cultivating tenants or to the landless or to those with small amounts of land. The main provisions of the Act therefore are clearly within the legislative competence of the State legislature under item 18 of List II and item 42 of List III and this is not being disputed on behalf of the petitioners. But what they contend is that in the process of doing this, the Government has by adopting certain devices taken away the money which was due to the landowner or to the person from whom the excess land is acquired. This argument is however fallacious because the compensation due to the landowner or the person from whom excess land is acquired is not what is provided by section 45 and s.72 but what is provided in section 52 and s.64. The adequacy of that compensation cannot be challenged in view of article 31(2), and there is therefore no justification for saying that the money due to the landowner or the person from whom the excess land is acquired is being taken away by the State. That argument would only be possible if the compensation was the whole amount arrived at under section 45 or under section 72 and from that the Government deducted money due to the landowner. That however is not so and the compensation to which the landowner or the person from whom the excess land is acquired is to be found only in sections 52 and 64 and there is thus no question of taking away any money due to the landowner. Further, whatever unfairness might appear because of the difference between sections 45 and 52 on the one hand and sections 64 and 72 on the other and the manner in which the compensation is shown as a percentage of the purchase price or the market value is removed by the provision in section 80 of the Act. That section provides for the constitution of an agriculturist rehabilitation fund in which the surplus, if any, of the purchase price after the disbursement therefrom of the compensation is to be put along with other moneys. This surplus does not go to the revenues of the State and the State cannot be said to have taken away for its own purpose any part of the compensation. Further section 80 provides that the fund shall be utilised for rendering help by way of loan, grant or otherwise to persons affected by the Act who are eligible for the same in accordance with the rules framed by the Government. The fund therefore created under section 80 of the surplus, if any, is to be utilised for rendering help to persons affected by the Act. That in our opinion clearly means either the landowners whose rights are affected by Chap. II or the persons from whom excess land is taken under Chap. III. The surplus money therefore is to be utilised for the benefit of the persons affected by the Act as indicated above. This section also provides that the Government will frame rules with respect to the persons affected and their eligibility for help from the fund. Our attention in this connection has been drawn to the eligibility rules framed under this section for the administration of the fund, and in particular to r. 161 which provides for eligibility for grants and loan. That rule in our opinion goes beyond the scope of section 80 in so far as it provides for making of grants or loans to persons not affected by the Act. We may in this connection refer to r. 161(a)(i) and (ii) and r. 161(b)(i) and (ii) which are so framed as to take within their scope even persons not affected by the Act, though r. 161(a)(iii) and r. 161(b)(iii) are with respect to persons who may be affected by the Act. Rule 161(a)(i) and (ii) and r. 161(b)(i) and (ii) in so far as they take in persons not affected by the Act are ultra vires of the provisions of section 80 and must be struck down on that ground and may have to be replaced by more suitable rules. But the rules which have been actually framed will not affect the provisions of section 80 which clearly show that the fund is for the benefit of those who are affected by the Act, namely, those who are affected by Chapters II and III of the Act, i.e., those landowners whose rights have been acquired under sections 41 and 42 and those persons from whom excess land is taken away under section 62. Section 80 thus clearly shows that any surplus that may arise is not taken away by the State for its own revenue purposes but is meant to be used for the benefit of those affected by the Act and therefore even the apparent result of the difference between sections 45 and 62 and ss.64 and 72 is taken away by the constitution of the fund under section 80, and it cannot be said at all under the circumstances that any device has been employed in the Act to take away the moneys of the landowners or the persons from whom excess land is taken away for the purpose of adding to the revenue of the State. We are therefore of opinion that the Act cannot be struck down as a colourable piece of legislation which is beyond the competence of the State Legislature. Article 31A was inserted in the Constitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, with retrospective effect so that it must be deemed to have been in the Constitution from the very beginning, i.e., January 26, 1950. The article was further amended by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955 which was also made retrospective and therefore article 31A as it stands today must be deemed to have been part of the Constitution right from the start, i.e., January 26, 1950. We are not concerned in the present petitions with cl. (1) of article 31A, which was extensively amended in 1955 but only with cl. (2). This clause originally read as follows: “In this article, (a) the expression ‘estate’ shall, in relation to any local area, have the same meaning as that expression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area, and shall also include any jagir, inam or muafi or other similar grant. (b) the expression ‘right’ in relation to an estate, shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub-proprietor, under-proprietor, tenure-holder or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue.” In 1955, in sub-cl. (a) the words “and in the States of Madras and Travancore-Cochin any janmam rights” were added at the end while in sub-cl. (b) the words “raiyat, under-raiyat” were added after the word “tenure-holder” and before the words “or other intermediary”. It will be seen therefore that so far as the meaning of the word “estate” is concerned, there was no change in sub-cl. (a) and the only change was with respect to the inclusive part of the definition of the word “estate”. The word “estate” has all along been defined to have the same meaning in relation to any local area as that expression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area. It is also remarkable that the word “intermediary” does not occur in sub-cl. (a) though it occurs in sub-cl. (b). The definition in sub-cl. (a) is self-contained and there is no scope for importing any idea of intermediary in the definition from sub-cl. (b). The reason why the words “other intermediary” are used in sub-cl. (b) which defines rights in relation to an estate, is that sub-clause mentions a number of intermediaries as such, like sub-proprietors, under-proprietors, tenure-holders but does not give a complete enumeration of all intermediaries that may be existing in an estate all over India and therefore uses the words “other intermediary” to bring in all kinds of intermediaries existing in an estate. As an example we may mention that formerly in Uttar Pradesh there were fixed-rate tenants in the permanently settled districts who were also intermediaries and it is such persons or their likes who were brought in within the sweep of the definition of rights in relation to an estate by the use of the words “other intermediary”. Therefore, when the words “raiyat, under-raiyat” were added in sub-cl. (b) in 1955, it was further enumeration within a class already there; further as held in The State of Bihar vs Rameshwar Pratap Narain Singh (1), their inclusion in the circumstances and in the particular setting showed that the words “or other intermediary” did not necessarily qualify or colour the meaning to be attached to these new tenures. The meaning of the word “estate” has however to be found in sub-cl. (a) and it is the words used in that sub-clause only which will determine its meaning irrespective of whether any intermediary existed in an estate or not. The meaning of the word “estate” in sub-cl. (a) is the same as it might be in the existing law relating to land tenure in force in a particular area. Where therefore there is an existing law in a particular area in which the word “estate” as such is defined the word would have that meaning for that area and there is no necessity then for looking for its local equivalent. But if in existing law of a particular area the word “estate” as such is not defined, but there is a definition of some other term which in that area is the local equivalent of the word “estate” then the word “estate” would have the meaning assigned to that term in the existing law in that area. In order, however, that one may be able to say that a particular term in an existing law in a particular area is a local equivalent of the word “estate” used in sub-cl. (a) it is necessary to have some basic idea of the meaning of the word “estate” for that purpose. That basic idea seems to be that the person holding the estate should be the proprietor of the soil and should be in direct relationship with the State paying land revenue to it, when it is not remitted in whole or in part. If a term therefore is defined in any existing law in a local area which corresponds to this basic idea of an estate that term would be a local equivalent of the word “estate” in that area. It is unnecessary to pursue the matter further because this aspect of the case has also been considered in Writ Petition No. 105 of 1961. It may be added that as the definition of the word “estate” came into the Constitution from January 26, 1950, and is based on existing law we have to look into law existing on January 26, 1950, for the purpose of finding out the meaning of the word “estate” in article 31A. Let us therefore look at state of the law as it was in the State of Madras on January 26, 1950, for the area from which these petitions come was then in the district of South Canara, which was then a part of the Province of Madras, which became the State of Madras on January 26, 1950. The usual feature of land tenure in Madras was the ryotwari form but in some districts, a landlord class had grown up both in the northern and southern parts of the Presidency of Madras as it was before the Constitution. The permanent settlement was introduced in a part of the Madras Presidency in 1802. There were also various tenures arising out of revenue-free grants all over the Province (see Chap. IV, Vol. III of Land Systems of British India by Baden-Powell) and sometimes in some districts both kinds of tenures, namely, landlord tenures and the ryotwari tenures were prevalent. There were various Acts in force in the Presidency of Madras with respect to landlord tenures while ryotwari tenures were governed by the Standing Orders of the Board of Revenue. Eventually, in 1908, the Madras legislature passed the Madras Estates Land Act, No. 1 of 1908, which was later amended from time to time. It contains a definition of the word “estate” as such in section 3(2) and when the Constitution came into force the relevant part of the definition was as follows: “‘Estate’ means: (a) any permanently settled estate or temporarily settled zamindari; (b) any portion of such permanently settled estate or temporarily settled zamindari which is separately registered in the office of the Collector; (c) any unsettled palaiyam or jagir; (d) any inam village of which the grant has been made, confirmed or recognised by the British Government, notwithstanding that subsequent to the grant, the village has been partitioned among the grantees or the successors in title of the grantee or grantees.” This Act applied to the entire Presidency of Madras except the Presidency town of Madras, the district of Malabar and the portion of the Nilgiri district known as South-East Wynaad. It thus applied to the district of South Canara from where these petitions come. So far therefore as the District of South Canara was concerned, there was an existing law which defined the word “estate” for that local area. Shortly before the Constitution came into force the Madras legislature had passed the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act No. XXVI of 1948. That Act provided for the abolition of estates subject to certain restrictions with which we are not concerned. It also provided for repeal of the Madras Permanent Settlement Regulation, 1802, and the Estates Land Act of 1908 to the extent and from the date on which notifications were made under section 3 of that Act. There was thus no repeal of Act I of 1908 by the Act of 1948, and it is not in dispute that Act No. 1 of 1908 was in force on January 26, 1950, in large parts of the Province of Madras including South Canara, and is still in force in such parts of it as have not been notified under section 3 of the Act of 1948. Therefore, we reach the position that when article 31A became applicable from January 26, 1950, Act No. 1 of 1908 was still in force in large parts of the Madras State and it contained a definition of the word “estate” as such. Further, Act I of 1908 was clearly a law of land tenures as a brief review of its provisions will show. Section 6 of the Act conferred occupancy rights on tenants of certain lands in “estates” as defined in the Act of 1908. Chapter II dealt with the general rights of landlords and tenants. Chapter III dealt with provisions relating to rate of rent payable by tenants and provided for enhancement, reduction, commutation, alteration and remission of rent. Chapter IV dealt with pattas and muchilikas. Chapter V provided for payment of rent and for realisation of arrears of rent. Chapter VI provided the procedure for recovery of rent. Other Chapters dealt with other matters including Chap. X which dealt with relinquishment and ejectment. It is clear therefore that the Act of 1908 was a law relating to land tenures. Therefore, we reach the position that in a law relating to land tenures which was in force in the State of Madras when the Constitution came into force the word “estate” was specifically defined. This law was in force in the whole of the State of Madras except some parts and was thus in force in the area from which the present petitions come. This area was then in the South Canara district of the State of Madras. We are therefore of opinion that the word “estate” in the circumstances can only have the meaning given to it in the Act of 1908 as amended up to 1950 in the State of Madras as it was on the date the Constitution came into force. We have already said that the Act of 1908 dealt with landlord tenures of Madras and was an existing law relating to land tenures. The other class of land tenures consisted of ryotwari pattadars which were governed by the Board’s Standing Orders, there being no Act of the legislature with respect to them. The holders of ryotwari pattas used to hold lands on lease from Government. The basic idea of ryotwari settlement is that every bit of land is assessed to a certain revenue and assigned a survey number for a period of years, which is usually thirty and each occupant of such land holds it subject to his paying the land revenue fixed on that land. But it is open to the occupant to relinquish his land or to take new land which has been relinquished by some other occupant or become otherwise available on payment of assessment, (see Land Systems of British India by Baden-Powell, Vol. III, Chap. IV, section II, p. 128). Though, theoretically, according to some authorities, the occupant of ryotwari land held it under an annual lease (see Macleane, Vol. I Revenue Settlement, p. 104), it appears that in fact the Collector had no power to terminate the tenant’s holding for any cause whatever except failure to pay the revenue or the ryot’s own relinquishment or abandonment. The ryot is generally called a tenant of Government but he is not a tenant from year to year and cannot be ousted as long as he pays the land revenue assessed. He has also the right to sell or mortgage or gift the land or lease it and the transferee becomes liable in his place for the revenue. Further, the lessee of a ryotwari pattadar has no rights except those conferred under the lease and is generally a sub-tenant at will liable to ejectment at the end of each year. In the Manual of Administration, as quoted by Baden-Powell, in Vol. III of Land Systems of British India at p. 129, the ryotwari tenure is summarised as that of a tenant of the State enjoying a tenant-right which can be inherited, sold, or burdened for debt in precisely the same manner as a proprietary right subject always to payment of the revenue due to the State”. Though therefore the ryotwari pattadar is virtually like a proprietor and has many of the advantages of such a proprietor, he could still relinquish or abandon his land in favour of the Government. It is because of this position that the ryotwari pattadar was never considered a proprietor of the land under his patta, though he had many of the advantages of a proprietor. Considering, however, that the Act of 1908 was in force all over the State of Madras but did not apply to lands held on ryotwari settlement and contained a definition of the word “estate” which was also applicable throughout the State of Madras except the areas indicated above, it is clear that in the existing law relating to land tenures the word “estate” did not include the lands of ryotwari pattadars, however valuable might be their rights in lands as they eventually came to be recognised. Turning now to the district of South Canara and the areas from which the present petitions come it appears that originally the ryotwari settlement was not in force in this area and two kinds of tenures were recognised, namely, mulawargdar and Sarkarigniwargdar. It is, however, unnecessary to go into the past history of the matter, for it is not in dispute that the ryotwari system was introduced in South Canara district in the early years of this century. The history will be found in the Book “Land Tenures in the Madras Presidency” by S. Sunderaraja Iyengar, II Edn., pp. 45-47, where it is said that “after the introduction of the ryotwari system into South Canara, no distinction now exists between the wargadar, the mulawargadar and kudutaledar and they are all ryotwari pattadars”. Therefore, when the Constitution came into force the ryotwari pattadars of South Canara were on the same position as the ryotwari pattadars of the rest of the State of Madras. Further, as the Act of 1908 was in force in South Canara also, though there may not be many estates as defined in that Act in this area it follows that in this area also the word “estate” would have the same meaning as in the Act of 1908 and therefore ryotwari pattadars and their lands would not be covered by the word “estate”. Further, there can be no question of seeking for a local equivalent so far as this part of the State of Kerala which has come to it from the former State of Madras is concerned. We are therefore of opinion that lands held by ryotwari pattadars in this part which has come to the State of Kerala by virtue of the States Reorganisation Act from the State of Madras are not estates within the meaning of article 31A(2)(a) of the Constitution and therefore the Act is not protected under article 31A(1) from attack under articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution. Re. The next contention on behalf of the petitioners is that the Act makes a discrimination between areca and pepper plantations on the one hand and certain other plantations on the other and should therefore be struck down as violative of article 14 of the Constitution. Section 2(39) of the Act defines “plantation” to mean any land used by a person principally for the cultivation of tea, coffee, rubber or cardamom or such other kind of special crops as may be specified by the Government by notification in the gazette. Areca and pepper plantations have however not been included in this definition. It is urged on behalf of the petitioners that in this part of the State there are a large number of areca and pepper plantations which are practically run on the same lines as tea, coffee and rubber plantations and there is no reason why discrimination should be made between areca and pepper plantations on the one hand and tea, coffee and rubber plantations on the other. The discrimination is said to arise from the provisions of section 3 and section 57 of the Act. Section 3(viii) which occurs in Chap. II dealing with the acquisition of the interest of landowners by tenants excepts tenancies in respect of plantations exceeding thirty acres in extent from the application of that chapter. The result of this is that tenants in plantations exceeding thirty acres in extent cannot acquire the interest of the landowners with respect to such plantations and the landowners continue to own such plantations as before. Further section 57 which is in Chap. III provides for exemption of all plantations whatever their extent from the provisions of that Chapter. Thus the ceiling area provided in section 58 will not apply to plantations which will be left out in calculating the ceiling area for the purpose of s.58. Further, s.59(2) provides that in calculating the ceiling area any cashew estate if it was a cashew estate on April 11, 1957 and continued as such at the commencement of section 59 (provided the cashew estate was principally planted with cashew nut trees and be a contiguous area not below 10 acres) will continue to be owned or held as before, though the ceiling in such cases would be reduced to half of that provided in s.58. These provisions inter alia confer benefits on those who hold plantations as defined in section 2(39) and also on those who have cashew estates as defined in the Explanation to section 59(2). The contention on behalf of the petitioners is that there is no reason why the same benefits which have been conferred on plantations as defined in the Act should not be conferred on those who hold areca and pepper plantations, and that there are no intelligible differentia which would justify the State legislature in treating the pepper and areca plantations differently from rubber, tea and coffee plantations. Article 14 has been the subject of consideration by this Court on a number of occasions and the principles which govern its application have been summarised in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia vs Shri Justice S.R. Tendolkar (1), in these words: “(a) that a law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual if, on account of some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not applicable to others, that single individual may be treated as a class by himself; (b) that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles; (c) that it must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds; (d) that the legislature is free to recognise degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest; (e) that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation; and (f) that while good faith and knowledge of the existing conditions on the part of a legislature are to be presumed, if there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding circumstances brought to the notice of the court on which the classification may reasonably be regarded as based, the presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reasons for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile or discriminating legislation.” The petitioners rely on cl.(f) of this summary and contention is that there is nothing to show either in the Act or even in the affidavit filed on behalf of the State in reply to the petitions or in the circumstances brought to the notice of the court that the classification in this case which excludes areca and pepper plantations and includes tea, coffee and rubber plantations is a proper classification based on intelligible differentia which are related to the objects and purposes of the Act. This brings us to a consideration of the reasons which may have impelled the legislature to treat plantations as a class differently from other lands. The objective of land reform including the imposition of ceilings on land holdings is to remove all impediments which arise from the agrarian structure inherited from the past in order to increase agricultural production, and to create conditions for evolving as speedily as possible an agrarian economy with a high level of efficiency and productivity (see p. 178 of the Second Five Year Plan). It is with this object in view that ceiling on land holdings has been imposed in various States. Even so, it is recognised that some exemptions will have to be granted from the ceiling in order that production may not suffer. This was considered in the Second Five Year Plan at p. 196 and three main factors were taken into account in deciding upon exemptions from the ceiling, namely: (1) integrated nature of operations, especially where industrial and agricultural work are undertaken as a composite enterprise, (2) specialised character of operations, and (3) from the aspect of agricultural production the need to ensure that efficiently managed farms which fulfil certain conditions are not broken up. Bearing these criteria in mind it was recommended in the Second Five Year Plan (see p. 196) that the following categories of farms may be exempted from the operation of ceiling namely: “(1) tea, coffee and rubber plantations; (2) orchards where they constitute reasonably compact areas; (3) specialised farms engaged in cattle breeding, dairying, wool raising etc; (4) sugarcane farms operated by sugar factories; and (5) efficiently managed farms which consist of compact blocks, on which heavy investment or permanent structural improvements have been made and whose break-up is likely to lead to a fall in production.” The same view has been reiterated in Chap. XIV of the Third Five Year Plan dealing with Land Reform and ceiling on agricultural holdings and para 28 thereof refers to the grounds of exemption envisaged by the Second Five Year Plan. It is obvious therefore that when the State legislature in this case exempted tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom plantations from the ceiling under Chap. III and treated plantations of over 30 acres as a special case for the purpose of Chap. II, it must have had the principles enunciated above in mind to differentiate them from ordinary cultivation of other crops. If that be so, the question immediately arises whether there is any reason for treating areca and pepper plantations differently. If there is none and areca and pepper plantations stand so far as these conditions are concerned on the same footing as tea, coffee and rubber plantations there will clearly be a discrimination against them by the provisions of the Act referred to above. Turning now to pepper plantations, first, we may refer to the information contained in Farm Bulletin No. 55 relating to pepper cultivation in India issued by the Farm Information Unit, Directorate of Extension, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, New Delhi in September 1959. It appears from this bulletin that Kerala is the most important pepper-producing State in India, where pepper is cultivated on an organised plantation scale over fairly extensive areas. There are three distinct regions of the pepper-growing belt, namely, (1) The Travancore and Cochin region, (2) The Malabar and South Canara region, and (3) the Coorg and North Canara region. Though pepper is essentially a homestead garden crop, growers were encouraged to grow it on plantation scale since 1928 when the price of pepper rose to about Rs. 700 per candy. Since then there has been a further rise in the price of pepper with the result that new homestead gardens and plantations have sprung up and pepper cultivation has extended a good deal. During the last fifty years, pepper which was largely a household garden crop has emerged as a plantation crop and fairly large-sized plantations of pepper exist in the submontane eastern parts of North Malabar and the Hosdrug taluk of South Canara, (the area from which these petitions come). In Hosdrug taluk in particular pepper is grown mostly on large-scale plantations and it is here that the finest and the best-organised pepper plantations in India exist. Some of the largest plantations among them have an area of 100 to 150 acres. Pepper vines commence yielding usually from the third year, the yield increasing gradually until the vines come to full bearing in about ten years. The economic life of a vine varies from place to place. From the tenth to the 25th year, the vines are in full bearing, and the yield begins to decline after the 30th year. The initial outlay on pepper plantations is heavy and the pepper crop requires continuous attention and care. The total area under pepper is over 2 lakh acres out of which about 20,000 acres are under pure pepper plantations. The initial expenditure on laying out a pepper plantation can be recovered only after several years and the best-organised and most extensive pepper plantations of India are in the Hosdrug taluk, South Canara (from where these petitions come) and North Malabar. This information taken from Farm Bulletin 55 shows that in the last fifty years pepper in India has reached the plantation stage and in particular in Hosdrug taluk from where these petitions come there are the best-organized and most extensive pepper plantations in India. The initial cost of laying out a pepper plantation is heavy and the pepper vines yield nothing for three years and full production comes only in the tenth year. Therefore, where pepper is cultivated as a plantation crop on a large scale the cost is heavy and may be comparable to the outlay on large-scale tea, coffee and rubber plantations. It is in these circumstances that we have to consider whether there has been discrimination against pepper plantations when they have not been included in the definition of plantation under section 2(39) of the Act. Turning to arecanut, reference may be made to Farm Bulletin No. 14 issued by the same authority. The major arecanut-growing belt in India is again the same regions, i.e., South Canara, Malabar, Coorg and Travancore-Cochin along with parts of Mysore, Bengal and Assam. Arecanut is also grown on plantation scale. Since the crop begins to bear fruit after about eight years, large sums have to be expended up to the bearing stage without any income till then. The estimated life of an arecanut garden is about 50 to 60 years, though some of the palms in the garden will be dying occasionally or becoming uneconomic and it will be necessary to replace them. For this reason underplanting is taken up periodically. It appears further from the Proceedings of the Ninth Annual General Special and Twelfth Ordinary Meetings of the Indian Central Arecanut Committee held on January 23, 1958, that the question whether arecanut gardens should be put under ceiling or not and whether there would be hampering of production which would be against national interest if a ceiling were imposed on such gardens had been referred to a Sub-committee for consideration. The Sub-committee reported that if areca gardens were brought under the ceiling it would hamper production which would be against the national interest and recommended to the Planning Commission, the Central Government and the State Governments that, as proposed by the Planning Commission in respect of tea, coffee and rubber plantations, orchards, specialised farms and efficiently managed farms, arecanut gardens be also similarly exempted from ceiling. The Sub-committee also noticed that arecanut cultivation involved heavy capital outlay in establishing, maintaining and protecting the arecanut trees. This recommendation of the Sub-committee came up for consideration before the Indian Central Arecanut Committee on January 23, 1958, and was accepted. Thus these proceedings show that fixation of ceiling on arecanut gardens would hamper production which would be detrimental to national economy. It is in this background therefore that we have to consider whether the non-inclusion of areca and pepper plantations in the definition in section 2(39) with the result that areca and pepper plantations do not enjoy similar benefits as others, is discriminatory. From what we have said above it has not been shown that there is any appreciable difference between the economics of tea, coffee and rubber plantations and areca and pepper plantations. It is true that plantations in areca and pepper are not so widespread as tea, coffee and rubber plantations but it is equally true that in this particular area from which these petitions come areca and pepper plantations are very common. The fact however that areca and pepper plantations are very common only in this area of the State of Kerala is no reason for treating them differently from tea, coffee and rubber plantations which are apparently more evenly distributed throughout the State. If the criteria evolved by the Planning Commission, as already indicated, apply to tea, coffee and rubber plantations in our opinion they equally apply to areca and pepper plantations and there is no reason for differentiating between these two sets of plantations. So far as areca is concerned we have the recommendation of the Sub-committee, mentioned above, endorsed by the Indian Central Arecanut Committee, that it would be detrimental to national economy not to extend the benefit of exemption from ceiling to arecanut plantations in the same way as is done in the case of tea, coffee and rubber plantations. As for pepper we have it from Farm Bulletin No. 55 that the best-organised and most extensive pepper plantations of India are in Hosdrug Taluk of South Canara and that some of them are even as large as 100 to 150 acres each. The result of the application of the ceiling and other provisions of the Act would mean the break-up of these plantations and may result in fall in production. It is to avoid the break-up of tea, coffee and rubber plantations and the consequent fall in production that ceiling has not been imposed on these plantations. The same reasons in our opinion lead to the conclusion that pepper plantations should also be treated similarly. In this connection reference may be made to the opinion expressed in Farm Bulletin No. 55 where the author has said that it is impossible to keep a large plantation of pepper in good tip-top condition, without incurring heavy expenditure and without great efforts and has added that in the existing conditions no one planter should have more than 10 acres of pepper plantation. This would seem to suggest that 10 acres is the economic optimum limit for pepper plantations. It is not clear however on what basis this recommendation is based, for undoubtedly the bulletin shows that there are plantations of much larger extent in this area and the plantations here are the best-organised and the most extensive throughout the whole of India. The only reason which seems to have been given in support of the opinion that 10 acres is the optimum area for a pepper plantation is that one planter in that region was of the view that unless the price of one candy of pepper remained at a high level of anything between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 2,000 it will be impracticable and unprofitable to maintain large-scale plantations of pepper in these regions, and if prices go down far below this level, large-scale pepper plantations may have even to be abandoned. This does not afford a sufficient basis for holding that 10 acres is the optimum holding for a pepper plantation. In the first place, it is mentioned at p. 8 of the bulletin that pepper began to be grown on plantation scale when the price rose to about Rs. 700 per candy in 1928. Therefore even if the price falls below Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 per candy there is no reason why pepper cultivation on a plantation scale should become impracticable, particularly as it is unlikely that the cost of only pepper will fall and not all other commodities. At p. 72 the bulletin mentions that the cost of cultivation of pepper can be brought down only if the general price level is brought down substantially. Now there is no reason to suppose that there would be a catastrophic fall in the price level of pepper only which would make all pepper plantations above 10 acres uneconomic and unprofitable. In any case this is not the reason urged on behalf of the State in support of not including pepper plantations in the definition of plantation. In this connection we ought to add that the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent is very unsatisfactory; no serious attempt has been made at all to justify the exclusion of pepper and arecanut from the exemption granted to tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom; no facts are stated and no data supplied in reply to the detailed allegations made in the petitions challenging the validity of the classification in question. The only reason given by the State in the counter-affidavit is that a plantation crop is generally understood to refer only to tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom. It is not quite clear what exactly is meant by this one sentence in the counter-affidavit in support of the definition. If a plantation crop is generally understood to refer to only tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom, it is not understood why the definition provides for extending the word “plantation” to other crops by notification. The very fact that power has been reserved for extending the definition by notification to other crops shows that other crops can also be grown on plantation scale. In view therefore of what we have said above with respect to the economics of areca and pepper cultivation, it is obvious that no sufficient reason has been shown for differentiating areca and pepper plantations in this area from tea, coffee and rubber plantations in the State. Making all the presumptions in favour of the classification made under s.2(39) it is clear that there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding circumstances which has been brought to our notice in this case on which the classification contained in section 2(39) can be said to be reasonably based. Considering the object and purpose of the Act and the basis on which exemption has been granted under Chapters II and III to plantations as defined in the Act, there appears to be no reason for making any distinction between tea, coffee and rubber on the one hand and areca and pepper on the other in this particular case. It is not as if tea, coffee and rubber are grown only on a large scale while areca and pepper are mostly grown on a small scale. We find from the report of the Plantation Inquiry Commission, 1956, that small holdings exist in tea, coffee and rubber plantations also and are in fact the majority of such plantations. For example, in the report of the Plantation Inquiry Commission relating to coffee at pp. 9 and 14 we find that out of the total number of registered estates more than 4,500 are between 5 acres and 25 acres while only about 2,200 estates are above 25 acres. Further there are more than 24,000 estates below 5 acres. Similarly at p. 97, Chap. XI, Part III of the Report dealing with rubber, out of the total of over 26,709 rubber estates, 23,300 are up to 5 acres, 1,900 up to 10 acres and only about 1,500 above 10 acres. So it appears that the large majority of plantations whether they be of coffee or rubber are below 10 acres and that is also the case with areca and pepper plantations. Thus there is no reason for giving preference to plantations of tea, coffee and rubber over plantations of areca and pepper for the conditions in the two sets of plantations whether for the purpose of ceiling under Chap. III or for the purpose of acquisition of landowners’ rights under Chap. II are the same. The reasons therefore which call for exemption of tea, coffee and rubber plantations equally apply to areca and pepper plantations and there is no intelligible differentia related to the object and purpose of the Act which would justify any distinction in the case of tea, coffee and rubber plantations as against areca and pepper plantations. We are therefore of opinion that the provisions relating to plantations are violative of article 14 of the Constitution. The next question is whether these provisions are severable, that is to say, whether the Kerala legislature would have passed the Act without these provisions. That depends upon the intention of the legislature and as far as we can judge that intention from the provisions of the Act, it seems clear to us that the legislature did not intend that the provisions relating to acquisition by tenants and ceilings should apply to plantations as defined in the Act, so that they may have to be broken up with consequent loss of production and detriment to national economy. It seems that the legislature could not have intended in order to carry out the purpose of the legislation to do so even after breaking up all the plantations which existed in the State. It follows therefore that the legislature would not have passed the rest of the Act without the provisions relating to plantations. As these provisions affect the entire working out of Chapters II and III of the Act which are the main provisions thereof, it follows that these provisions relating to plantations cannot be severed from the Act and struck down only by themselves. Therefore, the whole Act must be struck down as violative of article 14 of the Constitution so far as it applies to ryotwari lands in those areas of the State which were transferred to it from the State of Madras, and we order accordingly. Then we come to the attack that the Act is violative of article 14 on account of the manner in which ceiling has been fixed under section 58 thereof. Section 2(12) defines a “family” as meaning husband, wife and their unmarried minor children or such of them as exist. There are three kinds of families existing in this State namely, the joint Hindu family, Marumakhathayam family and Aliyasanthana family, the latter two being matriarchal. In the matriarchal family the husband and wife are not members of the same family but belong to different families. The joint Hindu family does not merely consist of the husband, wife and unmarried minor children; it consists at least of the husband, wife and all the children whether married or unmarried and whether minor or adult. The definition of “family” therefore in the Act is an artificial one which does not conform to any of the three kinds of families prevalent in the State. Turning now to section 58, the ceiling has been fixed in two ways. The first is by reference to a family as defined in the Act of not more than five members which is allowed 15 acres of double crop nilam or its equivalent with an addition of one acre of double crop nilam or its equivalent for each member in excess of five, so however that the total extent of the land shall not exceed 25 acres of double crop nilam or its equivalent. The second is by reference to an adult unmarried person who is allowed 7.50 acres of double crop nilam or its equivalent. It has been urged on behalf of the State that the provisions as they stand do not make any discrimination whatsoever for there is the same provision for all adult unmarried persons and the same for all families as defined in the Act. This in our opinion is an over-simplification of the provision relating to ceiling under section 58. On an argument of this kind no provision would ever be discriminatory for it is unlikely that a provision would on the face of it make a discrimination. The discriminatory nature of the provision has to be judged from the results that follow from it and we have no doubt that the results which follow from this double provision as to ceiling are bound to be discriminatory. If the ceiling had been fixed with respect to one standard whether it be of an individual person or of a natural family by which we mean a family recognised in personal law, the results may not have been discriminatory. But where the ceiling is fixed as in the present case by a double standard and over and above that the family has been given an artificial definition which does not correspond with a natural family as known to personal law, there is bound to be discrimination resulting from such a provision. A simple illustration will explain how the results of the manner in which the ceiling has been fixed by section 58 will lead to clear discrimination between person and person. Take the case of an adult unmarried person and a minor who is an orphan with no father, mother, brother or sister. Assume further that each owns 25 acres of land under personal cultivation. The former who is an adult unmarried person will retain 7.5 acres and will have to surrender 17.50 acres as excess land. The latter will be an artificial family under the definition of that word in section 2(12). This follows from the fact that a family consists of husband, wife and their unmarried minor children or such of them as exist. This is also made clear by section 61(2) which shows that even a minor who has no parents, and no brothers or sisters will constitute a family under section 2(12). This minor therefore as constituting a family will be entitled to 15 acres of land and will have to surrender only 10 acres as excess land. No justification has been shown to us on behalf of the State for this discriminatory treatment of two individual persons; nor are we able to understand why such discrimination which clearly results from the application of the provisions of section 58(1) is not violative of article 14 of the Constitution. Examples can be multiplied with reference to joint Hindu families also, which would show that in many cases discrimination will result on the application of these provisions to joint Hindu families. Similar would in our opinion be the case with Marumakhathayam and Aliyasanthana families where as we have already pointed out the husband and wife do not belong to the same family as known to personal law. Discrimination therefore is writ large on the consequences that follow from the provisions of section 58(1). We are therefore of opinion that section 58(1) is violative of the fundamental right enshrined in article 14; as that section is the basis of entire Chap. III the whole Chapter must fall with it. This would be an additional reason why Chap. III should be struck down as violative of Art. 14 in its application to ryotwari lands which have come to the State of Kerala from the State of Madras. It is contended that the manner in which the compensation is cut down progressively in sections 52 and 64 of the Act is violative of article 14. The Compensation payable under section 52 is determined in this manner. First the purchase price is arrived at under section 45. Thereafter section 52(2)(b) provides that the landowner or the intermediary, except in the case of religious, charitable and educational institution of a public nature, would be entitled to compensation. The compensation would consist of (1) the value of structures, wells and embankments of a permanent nature situated in the land and belonging to the landowner or the intermediary, as the case may be, and (2) the percentage of the value of interest of the landowner or the intermediary in respect of the land and the improvements other than those falling under sub-cl. (i) according to the scales specified in Sch. II. Schedule II then provides that the first Rs. 15,000 of the compensation will be paid in full. Thereafter there will be a reduction of 5 per cent in each slab of Rs. 10,000 till we reach compensation above Rs. 1,45,000. Thereafter the compensation arrived at under section 52 read with section 45 is reduced by 70 per cent so that the landowner or the intermediary gets only 30 per cent of what has been arrived at under section 52(2)(b) read with section 45. Similarly in section 64 the compensation payable for excess land surrendered is (i) the full value of any structures, wells and embankments of a permanent nature situate in the land and belonging to the person who surrenders such land, and (ii) the percentage of the market value of the land and improvements other than those specified above. Here again on the first Rs. 15,000 compensation at 60 per cent is to be paid. Thereafter the compensation is reduced by 5 per cent for each slab of Rs. 15,000 till we reach over Rs. 1,75,000 when the compensation is reduced by 75 per cent. The contention on behalf of the petitioners is that there is no intelligible differentia on which the purchase price determined under section 45 or the market value is to be reduced by different percentages depending on the total purchase price or the total market value of the interest to be acquired. The reply on behalf of the State is that there is really no discrimination inasmuch as the same percentage is reduced where the compensation payable to different persons is the same. That is undoubtedly so. But that alone is not in our opinion the end of the matter. The question which is posed for our consideration is why a person in whose case the purchase price or the market value is Rs. 15,000 should get the full purchase price or suffer a reduction in the market value at a certain rate while another person in whose case compensation is more than Rs. 15,000 should suffer reductions at a different rate which reductions become progressively higher as the purchase price or the market value increases. We could understand once the purchase price or the market value had been determined a uniform cut therefrom for all persons entitled to compensation. That would then raise the question of adequacy of compensation and unless the cut was so large as to make the compensation illusory the cut may be protected by Art.31(2). But in the present case there is not a uniform cut on the purchase price or the market value for all persons, the cut is higher as the purchase price or the market value gets bigger and bigger after the first slab of Rs. 15,000. This difference in cut is being justified on behalf of the State on the same principle on which (for example) the slab system exists for purposes of income tax. We are however of opinion that there is no comparison between the slab system of income tax rates and the present cuts. Taxation is a compulsory levy from each individual for the purpose of the maintenance of the State. We may therefore reasonably expect that a rich man may be required to make a contribution which may be higher than what may be proportionately due from his income for that purpose as compared to a poor man. This principle cannot be applied in a case where a person is deprived of his property under the power of eminent domain for which he is entitled to compensation. There is no reason why when two persons are deprived of their property one richer than the other, they should be paid at different rates when the property of which they are deprived is of the same kind and differs only in extent. No such principle can be applied in case where compensation is being granted to a person for deprivation of his property. Where one person owns property valued at Rs. 15,000 while another owns property valued at Rs. 30,000, both are equally deprived of the property. When therefore it comes to a question of payment of compensation we can see no reason why a person whose compensation amounts to Rs. 15,000 should get the whole of it or a large part of it while another person whose compensation amounts to (say) Rs. 30,000 should get something less than the first person. It is not as if there is some difference in the nature of the property which might justify different payments of compensation. What the Act provides is to work out the purchase price or the market value first for the purpose of determining compensation and then make different cuts from the purchase price or the market value according to whether in one case the purchase price or the market value is Rs. 15,000 and in another case it is more than Rs. 15,000. No justification is pointed out for this discrimination except the principle on which the slab system for the purpose of income tax is justified. That principle as we have just pointed out does not apply to a case of compensation. Nor are we able to see any rational classification which would justify different cuts based simply on the amount of compensation worked out on the basis of purchase price or market value. The only thing we can see is that because a person is possibly richer he must be paid less for the same type of land while a person who is poorer must be paid more. This kind of discrimination in the payment of compensation cannot in our opinion be possibly justified on the objects and purposes of the Act. The object and purpose of the Act, as we have already said, is to grant rights to cultivating tenants so that they may improve their lands resulting in larger production to the benefit of the national economy. Secondly, the object of the Act is to provide land for the landless and to those who may have little land by taking excess land from those who have large tracts of lands so that peasant proprietorship may increase with consequent increase in production due to greater interest of the cultivator in the soil. But these objects have no rational relation which would justify the making of different cuts from the purchase price or the market value for the purpose of giving compensation to those whose interests are being acquired under the Act. We can therefore see no justification for giving different compensation based on different cuts from the purchase price or the market value as provided in sections 52 and 64 of the Act. We may in this connection refer to Kameshwar Singh vs The State of Bihar (1), in which a similar question with respect to compensation provided in the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, came up for consideration. There the Act provided compensation at different rates depending upon the net income. The landowner having the smallest net income below Rs. 500 was to get twenty times the net income as compensation while the landowner having the largest net income, i.e., above Rs. 1,00,000 was to get only three times of the net income. Intermediate slabs provided different multiples for different amounts of net income. That provision was struck down by the Special Bench of the Patna High Court as violative of article 14. It may be mentioned that decision was given before the Constitution (First Amendment) Act adding article 31A and the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution was passed. Three learned Judges composing the Special Bench who heard that case were unanimously of the opinion that such difference in payment was violative of article 14 and the principle of progressive taxation did not apply to compensation for land acquired. We are of opinion that the view taken in that case is correct and the same applies to the present case. We may point out that case came in appeal to this Court (see, The State of Bihar vs Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh (1)). The appeal however was heard after article 31A and the Ninth Schedule had been introduced in the Constitution and therefore this Court had no occasion to consider whether such difference in payment of compensation would be violative of article 14. We are therefore clearly of opinion that the manner in which progressive cuts have been imposed on the purchase price under section 52 and the market value under section 64 in order to determine the compensation payable to landowners or intermediaries in one case and to persons from whom excess land is taken in another results in discrimination and cannot be justified on any intelligible differentia which has any relation to the objects and purposes of the Act. As the provision as to compensation is all-pervasive, the entire Act must be struck down as violative of article 14 in its application to ryotwari lands which have come to the State of Kerala from the State of Madras. In view of what we have said above on the main points urged in the petitions, it is unnecessary to consider other subsidiary points attacking particular sections of the Act on the ground that they were unreasonable restrictions on the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property under article 19(1)(f). We therefore allow the petitions and strike down the Act in relation to its application to ryotwari lands which have come to the State of Kerala from the State of Madras. The petitioners will get their costs from the State of Kerala, one set of hearing costs. SARKAR, J. I wish to say a few words on two of the questions that arise in these cases. The Act, the validity of which is challenged, provides for acquisition of lands for equitable distribution among the people who require it for cultivation by themselves. It provides for payment of compensation to those whose interests are acquired. It also provides for a mode of valuation of these interests. Then it provides by sections 52 and 64 for payment of compensation at a progressively smaller rate for larger valuations. For the higher slabs in the valuation made as provided by the Act, less and less is paid by way of compensation. It is said that these provisions for progressively diminishing compensation are discriminatory and unconstitutional. This is the first point with which I propose to deal. The question is whether the payment of compensation at a progressively smaller rate as the valuation is higher offends article 14 of the Constitution. Now it is not disputed that progressively higher rate of taxation by an Act taxing income is not unconstitutional. I think such taxation is too well recognised now to be challenged. If that is so and that was the basis on which arguments proceeded in this case I am unable to see that a statute providing for acquisition of property and for payment of compensation at a progressively lower rate for the higher slabs of valuation can be unconstitutional. “The reason for progressive taxation in the case of inheritance taxes and income taxes is the ability of those receiving or giving to pay”: Willis’s Constitutional Law (1936 ed.) p. 597. The cases in America that I have looked up also put the matter on the same basis. The classification by progressively higher taxation in a taxing statute is therefore good if based on the taxpayers’ ability to pay. It is however said that what applies in the case of a taxing statute cannot apply to a statute permitting acquisition of property on payment of compensation. I do not see why? I am not aware that the test for determining whether there has been unequal treatment is different with different varieties of statutes, that the test for a taxing statute is not the same as that for a statute providing for acquisition on payment of compensation. I think the test is the same for all statutes, and it is that there must be an intelligible differentia having a rational relation to the object of the Act. Now the object of a taxing statute is to collect revenue for the governance of the country. Ability to pay is acknowledged to be an intelligible differentia having a relation to such an object. The object of the statute with which we are concerned is to acquire land on payment of compensation so that the land may be equitably distributed among the people. If under a statute whose object is to collect revenue more can be legitimately demanded from a person having more, it seems to me that under a statute whose object is to acquire land by paying compensation less can equally legitimately be paid to a person who has more. Ability to pay, or which is the same thing as ability to bear the loss arising from smaller payment received, would in either case be an intelligible differentia having a rational relation to the object of the Act. In one case it serves the object by collecting more revenue for adding to the resources for governing the country and in the other case it serves the object by making it possible for the State by payment of less money out of its resources to acquire lands for better distribution. In both cases the State resources are benefited, in one by augmentation and in the other by prevention of larger depletion. Therefore, I would accept the learned Attorney General’s argument that sections 52 and 64 of the Act cannot be held to be discriminatory and void for the same reason on which progressive rates of taxation are held not to be so in the case of an Income-tax Act. The next question on which I wish to say a few words concerns those provisions of the Act which exempt plantations of tea, coffee, rubber or cardamom or such other kinds of special crops as the Government may specify, from certain provisions of the Act. Plantations have been defined in section 2(39) of the Act as land used by a person principally for the cultivation of tea, coffee, rubber or cardamom or other notified crops. No other crop appears to have been notified yet. Section 58 of the Act provides the ceiling area of land which may be held by any individual proprietor. Land above the ceiling has to be surrendered to the Government. Section 57 of the Act provides that this provision would not apply to plantations as defined in section 2(39). Again, Ch. II of the Act which gives the tenants the right to purchase land from the landlords and vests in the Government the lands of the landlords not themselves cultivating them above the ceiling fixed, is by section 3(viii) not made applicable to plantations exceeding thirty acres in extent. The question is whether the benefit so given to the plantations as defined in the Act is discriminatory. The petitioners own large-scale cultivation of areca and pepper. They contend that no legitimate differentiation is possible between lands on which areca and pepper are grown and lands on which tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom are grown. No doubt the presumption is that a statute is constitutional but such presumption is not conclusive. It is also true that a court is entitled to assume the existence of all rational basis on which the classification made by an Act may be justified. Even so, it seems to me, that the present classification is, on the materials now before us, not justified. It may be that plantations of tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom, especially the first three, are usually large in size and require big investments. It may be that they are carried on as industries which give employment to a large labour force. These characteristics may however only justify the putting of large plantations of these crops in a class. The Act however exempts all lands on which tea, coffee, rubber or cardamom is grown irrespective of the size of the business carried on or of labour employed on them, as a class. Materials have been placed before us to show that there are a very large number of smaller plantations growing tea, coffee and rubber. There are also many areca and pepper plantations exceeding thirty",

                "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 93 of 1956. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the April 14, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 156 of 1955 and Criminal Revision Application No. 435 of 1955 arising out of Judgment dated the January 3,1955, of the Court of the Additional Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, in Case No. 9/p of 1954. Purshottam Tricumdas, J. B. Dadachanji, section N. Andley and Rameshwar Nath, for the appellant. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General of India, Porus A. Mehta and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent. February 12. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J. This appeal with special leave under article 136 of the Constitution raises the question whether the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 (Ordinance No. III of 1946) promulgated by the Governor General of India on January 12, 1946, was in operation on July 11, 1953, when the offence under section 7 read with section 4 thereof was committed by the appellant herein. The appellant who was the accused No. 1 before the Additional Chief Presidency Magistrate 's Court, Bombay, was charged along with the accused Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6 with having on or about July II, 1953, transferred by sale 10 High Denomination Bank Notes of the Denomination of Rs. 1,000 each to one Velji Lakhamshi Joshi for Rs. 1,800 at the rate of Rs. 180 per note and thus contravened the provisions of section 4 of the Ordinance and committed an offence punishable under section 7 of the Ordinance read with section 109 of the Indian Penal Code. A preliminary objection was urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that the said Ordinance was not in operation at the date when the offence was alleged to have been committed and that therefore the prosecution was not maintainable. This objection was overruled by the learned Presidency Magistrate and the trial ended in the conviction of the appellant along with the co accused of the offence with which they had been charged. The appellant was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 8,000 and in default suffer six months ' rigorous imprisonment and the co accused of the appellant were awarded varying sentences of fine with which however we are not concerned. The appellant took an appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay being Criminal Appeal No. 156 of 1955. The State of Bombay, the respondent herein, also filed an application for enhancement of the sentence, being Criminal Revision Application No. 435 of 1955. The co accused of the appellant had also filed appeals against their convictions and sentences of fine imposed upon them and all these appeals and the application of the respondent were heard together by a Division, Bench of the High Court. The High Court agreed with the learned Presidency Magistrate in regard to the finding of fact and held that the appellant had in fact transferred by sale 10 High Denomination Bank Notes of Rs. 1,000 each to the possession of Velji Lakhamshi and his act fell within the prohibition enacted in section 4 of the Ordinance. The High Court also overruled the contentions which were urged before it in regard to the Ordinance having lapsed and ceased to be in operation before July 11, 1953, the date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed. It accordingly confirmed the conviction recorded against the appellant by the learned Additional Chief Presidency Magistrate. In regard to the sentence the High Court saw no ground for enhancing the same and confirmed the sentence of fine of Rs. 8,000 and in default six months ' rigorous imprisonment which had been awarded by the learned Presidency Magistrate to the appellant. The appellant applied to the High Court for a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution. The said application was however dismissed by the High Court with the result that he applied for and obtained from this Court special leave under article 136 of the Constitution. The decision of this appeal turns on the construction of section 72 of the 9th Sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935 (25 and 26 Geo. 42) and section 1 (3) of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940 (3 and 4 Geo. Section 72 of the 9th sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935, read as follows: \" The Governor General may, in cases of emergency, make and promulgate ordinances for the peace and good Government of British India or any part thereof, and any ordinance so made shall, for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation, have the like force of law as an Act passed by the Indian Legislature; but the power of making ordinances under this section is subject to the like restrictions as the power of the Indian Legislature to make laws; and any ordinance made under this section is subject to the like disallowance as an Act passed by the Indian Legislature, and may be controlled or ,superseded by any such Acts. \" Section 1 (3) of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, ran as under: \" Section seventy two of the Government of India Act, (which, as set out in the Ninth Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, confers on the Governor General power to make Ordinances in cases of emergency) shall, as respects Ordinances made during the period specified in section three of this Act, have effect as if the words \"for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation\" were omitted; and, notwithstanding the provision in the said section seventy two that the power of making ordinances thereunder is subject to the like restrictions as the power of the Indian Legislature to make laws (a) Ordinances may, during the said period, be made under that section affecting the Army Act, the Air Force Act, or the Naval Discipline Act; and (b) Section one hundred and eleven of the Government of India Act, 1935 (which exempts certain British subjects from certain Indian Laws) shall not apply to any ordinance made under the said section seventy two during that period. \" Section 3 referred to hereinabove was in the terms following: \" The period referred to in the preceding sections is the period beginning with the date of the passing of this Act and ending with such date as His Majesty may by Order in Council declare to be the end of the emergency which was the occasion of the passing of this Act. \" The India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, was passed on June 27, 1940 , and was an Act to make emergency provisions with respect to Government of India and Burma. On April 1, 1946, was published in the Gazette of India Extraordinary His Majesty 's Order in Council called \" The India and Burma (Termination of Emergency) Order, 1946 \". By the said order the period of emergency referred to in section 3 of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, was declared to have ended on April 1, 1946. The period specified in section 3 of the said Act thus extended from June 27, 1940, to April 1, 1946. The Ordinance in question was promulgated on January 12, 1946, and was therefore within the said period. The argument which was addressed before us by the learned counsel for the appellant based on these provisions was (a) that as soon as the declaration that the emergency was at an end was made on April 1, 1946, the original position was restored and the Ordinance in question which had been promulgated in exercise of the emergency powers ipso facto lapsed when the emergency was declared to have ended, (b) that, in the alternative, section 72. of the 9th Sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935, having been thus restored with effect from April 1, 1946, one must look to its terms as they originally stood to justify the continuance of the ordinance in question after April 1, 1946, whensoever it may have been promulgated. It will be useful at this stage to see what was the scheme provided in the Government of India Act, 1935, for enacting legislative measures. It may be noted that the Act envisaged the establishment of the Federation of India. Part II, ch. 3 provided for the constitution of the Federal Legislature which was to consist of two chambers known respectively as the Council of States and the House of Assembly. The normal legislative procedure required a bill to be passed by both the Chambers of the Federal Legislature and assented to by the Governor General. There was a distribution of legislative powers between the Federal Legislature and the Provincial Legislatures and the Federal Legislature was invested with the power to make laws for. the whole or any part of British India or for any Federated State with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the Federal Legislative List and any of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent Legislative List. Power was however given, to the Federal Legislature, if the Governor General in his discretion declared by a \"Proclamation of Emergency\" that a grave emergency existed whereby the security of India was threatened, whether by war or internal disturbance, to make laws for a Province or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List. These were the powers of the Federal Legislature to enact legislative measures. The Governor General was, however, conferred certain legislative powers in Part II, ch. 4. Power was conferred upon him to promulgate Ordinances if at any time when the Federal Legislature was not in session he was satisfied that circumstances existed which rendered it necessary for him to take immediate action. Ordinances thus promulgated were to have the same force and effect as Acts of the Federal Legislature assented to by the Governor General. But every such Ordinance would cease to operate at the expiration of six months from the re assembly of the Legislature. Similar power was conferred upon the Governor General to promulgate Ordinances if at any time he was satisfied that circumstances existed which rendered it necessary for him to take immediate action for the purpose of enabling him satisfactorily to discharge his functions in so far as he was required in the exercise thereof to act in his discretion or to exercise his individual judgment. Such Ordinances also were to have the same force and effect as the Acts of the Federal Legislature assented to by the Governor General and were to continue in operation for such period not exceeding six months as may be specified therein but could by subsequent Ordinances be extended for a further period not exceeding six months. Power was also conferred upon the Governor General if at any time it appeared to him that for the purpose of enabling him satisfactorily to discharge his functions in so far as he was required in the exercise thereof to act in his discretion or, to exercise his individual judgment it was essential that provision should be made by legislation, to enact I SUPREME COURT REPORTS 641 Governor General 's Acts which when enacted were to have the same force and effect as Acts of the Federal Legislature assented to by the Governor General. These were the special legislative powers conferred upon the Governor General which could be exercised by him when the normal legislative procedure could not be resorted to. It is worthy of note however that howsoever and under whatever circumstances the legislative powers vested in the Governor General were exercised by him, the Governor General 's Acts thus enacted and the Ordinances thus promulgated were equated with the Acts of the Federal Legislature assented to by the Governor General. Part XIII enacted Transitional Provisions. A period of time was bound to elapse between the commencement of Part III of the Act which related to the Governor 's Provinces and the establishment of the Federation and section 317 of the Act continued in force certain provisions of the Government of India Act with amendments consequential on the provisions of the Act set out in the 9th Sch. thereof until the estab lishment of the Federation. Section 72 above quoted formed part of the 9th Sch. under the caption \" Indian Legislature\" and conferred upon the Governor General power to make and promulgate Ordinances for the peace and good Government of British India or any part thereof in cases of emergency. Ordinances thus promulgated by the Governor General in exercise of the power thus conferred upon him were to continue in operation for the space of not more than six months from the date of their promulgation and were to have the like force of law as Acts passed by the Indian Legislature. They were also equated with the. Acts passed by the Indian Legislature by having resort to the normal legislative procedure set out in the Government of India Act. Even though the Governor General 's Acts and the Ordinances promulgated by him were thus equated with the Acts passed by the Federal Legislature or the Indian Legislature as the case may be, the period of duration thereof had to be determined. Every statute for which no time is limited is called a perpetual Act, and its duration is prima facie perpetual. It continues in force until it is repealed.

If an Act contains a proviso that it is to continue in force only for a certain specified time, it is called a Temporary Act. This result would follow not only from the terms of the Act itself but also from the fact that it was intended only as a temporary measure. This ratio has also been applied to emergency measures which continue during the subsistence of the emergency but lapse with the cessation thereof. It was therefore contended that Ordinances promulgated under the emergency powers vested in the Governor General would be in operation during the period of emergency but would cease to be in operation once the emergency was declared to have ended. In the instant case before us the Ordinance in question was promulgated in exercise of the emergency powers vested in the Governor General under section 72 of the 9th Sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935, and it was urged that the Ordinance thus promulgated would cease to be in operation after the emergency was declared to have ended on April 1, 1946, by the India and Burma (Termination of Emergency) Order, 1946, in spite of the words of limitation \" for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation \" having been omitted from section 72 by section 1(3) of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940. Reliance was placed in support of this contention on the observations of Vardachariar C. J. in King Emperor vs Benoari Lall Sharma and others(1): \" Legislation by Ordinance has no doubt been given the same effect as ordinary legislation and the ambit as to the subject matter is the same in both cases. But there are two fundamental points of difference which have a material bearing on the present question: One is that by the very terms of s.72 of the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution Act, the operation of the Ordinance is limited to a period of (1) , 137. 643 six months (and even now it is only temporary, though the particular limit has been removed), and secondly, it is avowedly the exercise of a special power intended to meet an emergency.\" Zafrulla Khan J. also had expressed himself to the same effect in King Emperor vs Sibnath Banerjee (1): \" The legislature can at any time enact a measure and such measure can remain in force without any limit of time; but the exercise of the Ordinance making power is limited in two ways (1) by the limitation as to the circumstances in which it can be exercised, and (ii) by the limitation as to the time during which any measure so enacted can remain in operation. The existence of an emergency is a condition precedent to the exercise of the power. The fact that the Court cannot go behind a declaration of emergency made by the Ordinance making authority cannot affect this question. The power was intended to be availed of and could be availed of only in an emergency, whereas ordinary legislation is not governed by any such limitation. Similarly, an Ordinance is necessarily of limited duration, whether under section 72 or under the terms of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1940. \" An argument was accordingly addressed before us that even though the Ordinance in question had been promulgated during the period specified in a. 3 of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, viz., between June 27, 1940, and April 1, 1946, and section 72 of the 9th Sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935, was to be read with the omission of the words \" for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation \" therefrom, the effect of such omission was not to continue the duration of the Ordinance in question in any event beyond April 1, 1946. The Ordinance lapsed or ceased to be in operation on the, declaration having been made on April 1, 1946, that the emergency had ended. This argument however ignores the fact that whatever Governor General 's Acts were enacted or Ordinances promulgated by him in exercise of his special legislative powers or in exercise of the emergency_ power conferred upon him by section 72 of the 9th Sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935, were all equated with the Acts of the Federal Legislature or the Indian Legislature, as the case may be, assented to by the Governor General. If there was a limitation to be found in the Acts or the Ordinances themselves in regard to the duration thereof the same was to prevail. But if no time was limited in the enactment itself for its duration it was to continue in force until it was repealed. If by the operation of section 1 (3) of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, the words \" for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation \" were omitted from section 72 during the period specified in section 3 of that Act, viz., June 27,1940 to April 1, 1946, there was no limitation of the period of duration of the Ordinance in question and the Ordinance having the like force of law as an Act passed by the Indian Legislature without any limitation on its duration was to continue in force until it was repealed. The emergency under which the Governor General was invested with the power to make and promulgate Ordinances for the peace and good government of British India or any part thereof under section 72 was the condition of the exercise of such power, by the Governor General and did not impose any limitation on the duration of the Ordinances thus promulgated. For determining the duration of such Ordinances one had to look to the substantive provisions of section 72 which in terms enacted and laid down the limitation of \"not more than six months from its promulgation \" on the life of the Ordinance. If these words had not been omitted by section 1 (3) of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, the Ordinances thus promulgated would have been of a duration of not more than six months from their promulgation. Once these words were omitted by a. 1 (3) of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, section 72 of the 9th Sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935, would read as under: The Governor General may, in cases of emergency, make and promulgate ordinances for the peace and good government of British India or any part thereof and any ordinance so made shall. . . have the like force of law as an Act passed by the Indian Legislature; but the power of making ordinances under this section is subject to the like restrictions as the power of the Indian Legislature to make laws; and the like disallowance as an Act passed by the Indian Legislature, and may be controlled or superseded by any such Act. \" The effect of the deletion of these words from section 72 leaving the section to be read as above had the necessary effect of equating the Ordinances which were promulgated between June 27, 1940, and April 1, 1946, with Acts passed by the Indian Legislature without any limitation of time as regards their duration. Ordinances thus promulgated were perpetual in duration and continued in force until they were repealed. This position was considered by the Federal Court in J. K. Gas Plant Manufacturing Co., (Rampur) Ltd. and others vs King Emperor (1) where Spens C. J. observed: \" These Ordinances were made under the powers conferred on the Governor General by section 72 of the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution Act, as amended by the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940 (3 & 4 Geo. 6, Ch. 33). Under the said section 72, as it originally stood, Ordinances were limited to an effective life of six months only from the date of promulgation. Sub section (3) of section I of the said Act, however, provided that in respect of Ordinances made under section 72 during the period specified in section 3 of the Act, section 72 should have effect as if the words ,for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation\" were omitted. The period specified in section 3 of the Act is \" the period beginning with the date of the passing of this British India or any part thereof and any ordinance so made shall. . . have the like force of law as an Act passed by the Indian Legislature; but the power of making ordinances under this section is subject to the like restrictions as the power of the Indian Legislature to make laws; and the like disallowance as an Act passed by the Indian Legislature, and may be controlled or superseded by any such Act. \" The effect of the deletion of these words from section 72 leaving the section to be read as above had the necessary effect of equating the Ordinances which were promulgated between June 27, 1940, and April 1, 1946, with Acts passed by the Indian Legislature without any limitation of time as regards their duration. Ordinances thus promulgated were perpetual in duration and continued in force until they were repealed. This position was considered by the Federal Court in J. K. Gas Plant Manufacturing Co., (Rampur) Ltd. and others vs King Emperor (1) where Spens C. J. observed: \" These Ordinances were made under the powers conferred on the Governor General by section 72 of the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution Act, as amended by the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940 (3 & 4 Geo. 6, Ch. 33). Under the said section 72, as it originally stood, Ordinances were limited to an effective life of six months only from the date of promulgation. Sub section (3) of section I of the said Act, however, provided that in respect of Ordinances made under section 72 during the period specified in section 3 of the Act, section 72 should have effect as if the words ,for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation\" were omitted. The period specified in section 3 of the Act is \" the period beginning with the date of the passing of this Act and ending with such date as His Majesty may by Order in Council declare to be the end of the emergency which was the occasion of the passing of this Act. \" The date of `the passing of the (1) , 161. 646 said Act was the 27th June, 1940, and the emergency was not notified to have come to an end on the 1st April, 1946. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the true construction to be given to section 72 as so amended was in effect to substitute in section 72 in respect of the duration of an Ordinance, the period specified in section 3 of the Act for the original six months ' period and that accordingly on the expiration of that period, viz., on the 1st April, 1946, Ordinances made after the passing of the Act automatically came to an end. It was not made very clear how one could arrive at such a construction. It appears to be based on the suggestion that the power to promulgate an Ordinance under section 72 was by the section confined to the existence of an emergency, Cf: the words in the sub section \"in cases of emergency \", and that the Act was intituled an Act to make emergency provision with respect to the Government of India and Burma and defined the period of emergency. Unless therefore the construction contended for by the appellants was accepted no period would be provided for the continuance of these Ordinances, and that could not have been the intention of the legislature, as the ordinance making power of the Governor General was recognised as temporary only. In our opinion, the emergency on the happening of which an Ordinance can be promulgated is separate and distinct from and must not be confused with the, emergency which occasioned the pawing of the Act and the clear effect of the words of the, Act on section 72 is that Ordinances promulgated under that subsection during the period specified in section 3 of the Act are subject to no time limit as regards their existence and validity, unless imposed by the Ordinances themselves, or other amending or repealing legislation, whether by Ordinance or other. In our judgment, it is clear that the second Lahore Tribunal did not cease to exist or to have jurisdiction in the case under appeal by reason of the expiration on the 1st April, 1946, of the period specified in section 3 of the Act in question. \" In our opinion, the above observations of Spens C. J. enunciate the correct position. The Ordinance in question having been promulgated during the period between June 27, 1940, 'and April 1, 1946, was perpetual in duration and continued in force until it was repealed. Our attention has not been drawn to any subsequent Ordinance or Act of the Indian Legislature amending or repealing the said Ordinance with the result that it continues to be in force and was in operation on July 11, 1953, the date on which the offence in question was committed by the appellant. This position was recognized in the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, issued under the Constitution Of India. In the Second Schedule to the said Order were contained several Central Ordinances enacted between 1940 and 1946 including the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 (Ordinance No. III of 1946) where in section II thereof the words \" Part A States and Part C States \" were to be sub stituted for \"the provinces\". It is not necessary to refer to the other Ordinances appearing in this compilation but suffice it to say that in respect of all the Ordinances which were thus promulgated by the Governor General in exercise of the power conferred upon him under section 72 of the 9th Sch. of the Government of India Act, 1935, the continuance thereof even after April 1, 1946, was predicated and the adaptations prescribed in the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, issued under the Constitution of India were made applicable thereto. This position is further supported by referring to the relevant provisions of the (II of 1934). Section 26 of that Act provided ill (1) Subject to the provisions of sub section (2), every bank note shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein, and shall be guaranteed by the Central Government. (2)On recommendation of the Central Board the Central Government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any denomination, shall cease to be legal tender save at such office or a agency of the bank and to such extent as may be specified in the notification. 648 Under section 1 (2) of the Act as it stood, the Act extended to whole of India excepting the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The ' High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 (Ordinance No. III of 1946) declared that Denomination Notes of the denominational value of Rs. 500, Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 10,000 ceased to be legal tender in payment or on account at any place in British India on the expiry of January 12, 1946. The Ordinance having continued in operation even after the declaration of the emergency having come to an end was made on April 1, 1946, the said notes continued to be ineffective as legal tender in India, though the position in Jammu and Kashmir in regard to the same could not be affected by reason of the , not having been made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir as stated above. On September 25, 1956, however, the (LXII of 1956) being an Act to provide for the extension of certain laws to the State of Jammu and Kashmir was passed by the Parliament. In the Schedule to that Act was contained the (II of 1934). The words \" except the State of Jammu and Kashmir\" were omitted from section 1, sub section (2) and section 26A was added after section 26 of the Act. Section 26A provides: ,, Notwithstanding anything contained in section 26, no bank note of the denominational value of five hundred rupees, one thousand rupees or ten thousand rupees issued before the 13th day of January, 1946, shall be legal tender in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein. The law in the State of Jammu and Kashmir with regard to these High Denomination Bank Notes issued before January 13, 1946, was thus brought into line with the law as it obtained in the rest of India. This would certainly have not been done but for the acceptance of the position that the Ordinance in question continued in operation even after April 1, 1946, and was in operation right throughout even after April 1, 1946. 649 The alternative argument addressed before us by the learned counsel for the appellant need not detain us at all, for the simple reason that reading section 72 in the manner suggested would be tantamount to giving a retrospective effect to the section as it originally stood in regard to Ordinances which had been promulgated between June 27, 1940, and April 1, 1946. There is nothing to justify such retrospective operation. As regards such Ordinances the period of their duration had to be determined having regard to the provisions of section 72 as they stood with the omission of the words \" for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation \" therefrom during tHe period specified in section 3 of the India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940, and the Ordinance in question was therefore not limited to the space of not more than six months from the date of its promulgation but was perpetual in its duration with the result that it continues in operation until it is repealed. There is no warrant for reading the provisions of section 72 with the omitted words restored to their original position after April 1, 1946, while determining the duration of the Ordinances which had been promulgated between June 27, 1940, and April 1, 1946. Both the contentions urged by the learned counsel for the appellant before us having thus failed, it follows that the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetization) Ordinance, 1946 (Ordinance No. III of 1946) was in operation on July 11, 1953, the date on which the offence was committed by the appellant and the appellant was rightly convicted by both the courts below. The appeal will accordingly stand dismissed. Appeal dismissed.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeals Nos. 29 and 30 of 1951. Appeals from the judgment and decree dated 26th October, 1943, of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Verma and Yorke JJ.) in First Appeal No. 48 of 1938 arising out of the judgment and decree dated 6th August, 1937, of the Court of the Additional Civil Judge at Agra in Suit No. 30 of 1936. M.C. Setalvad and Kirpa Ram (K. B. Asthana, with them) for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 29 of 1951. K.N. Agarwal for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 30 of 1951. C.K. Daphtary (G. C. Mathur, with him) for the respondents in both the appeals. April 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J. 796 Mst. Khem Kuer, the young widow of Shah Chiranji Lal, was murdered on the 28th August, 1919, and Mst. Mohan Kuer, the mother, died on the 5th December, 1932. Prem Kuer, the respondent in the appeal, claiming herself to be the heir to Shah Chiranji Lal as his sister, brought the suit giving rise to this appeal in the court of the civil judge, Agra, against, amongst others, Mst. Phool Kuer, the present appellant, for recovery of possession of the properties of Shah Chiranji Lal and mesne profits. Prem Kuer joined her half sister Mst. Ram Kuer and their sons as plaintiffs along with herself. In the array of defendants were impleaded Mst. Phool Kuer and Mst. Khem Kuer, widows of Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal and his sons and a host of others as transferees of the properties. The main defence to the suit was that Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal were recognized to be the owners and heirs to the entire estate of Shah Chiranji Lal by Khem Kuer and Mohan Kuer in a family settlement arrived at between the parties in suit No. 120 of 1915, that by virtue of this family settlement the estate of the deceased was vested in them subject to the life estates of the two women and that the plaintiffs who came to be recognized as reversioners by the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, 11 of 1929, were not entitled to claim it. It was further pleaded that on the death of Khem Kuer in 1919, Mohan Kuer surrendered the estate in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal and they took possession of it as owners and the plaintiffs who subsequently became statutory heirs in 1919 could not be allowed to question the surrender and reopen the succession which could not remain in abeyance. The learned additional civil judge who tried the suit, dismissed it holding that the compromise of 1915 was a bona fide settlement of a bona fide dispute and was binding as a family settlement being for the benefit of the estate, that Mohan Kuer surrendered the estate validly in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho 795 MAHAJAN J. The dispute in this appeal concerns the zemindari and house properties last owned by Shah Chiranji Lal who died at a young age on the 14th May, 1913, leaving him surviving a widow, Mst. Khem Kuer, and his mother Mst. Mohan Kuer, besides a number of collaterals, indicated in the pedigree table below : Shah Pirthi Raj : : : : : : : : Mst. Tulsa Kuer=Shah Lal Chand=Mst.

Khem Kuer : : : : : : Manohar Lal Lachmi Narain 797 Lal and they entered into possession of it after the death of Khem Kuer. Some of the transferees who had been impleaded as defendants compromised the suit with the plaintiffs and that part of the suit was decided according to the terms thereof between those parties. Prem Kuer preferred an appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad against the decree dismissing her suit. The High Court by its judgment dated the 26th October, 1943, allowed the appeal, reversed the findings of the learned additional civil judge on the above issues and decreed the plaintiffs ' suit with costs. Some of the transferee defendants compromised with the plaintiff appellant in the High Court and the appeal was decided in terms thereof in their favour. Two main points which are in controversy in this appeal and require consideration, are: 1. Whether the compromise in suit No. 120 of 1915 amounts to a family settlement and binds the plaintiff respondent, and, 2. Whether the surrender by Mst. Mohan Kuer was a valid surrender under Hindu law. In order to appreciate the respective contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out shortly in chronological order the history of the events which has resulted in this controversy. As already stated, Shah Chiranji Lal died on the 14th May, 1913, leaving considerable movable and immovable property. At the time of his death, his widow Khem Kuer was about eleven years old and his mother Mohan Kuer was about 53 years old. The two reversioners, Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, made an application for mutation of names of the estate in their favour claiming it on the basis of a will alleged to have been made by Shah Chiranji Lal on the 13th May, 1913, a day before his death. On the 10th of September, 1913, an application was made by Mohan Kuer for herself and as guardian of Khem Kuer challenging the genuineness of the will and claiming that the estate of the late Shah Chiranji Lal should be mutated in their names. Notice of this application was given to the two reversioners but they thought it prudent not to appear and to contest the contentions raised by the two ladies, with the result that the inheritance of the late Chiranji Lal was mutated in the name of the widow as sole heir under the guardianship of Mohan Kuer by an order dated the 28th October, 1913. The reversioners had also made applications in pending suits for getting themselves impleaded as legal representatives. Mohan Kuer applied for the removal of their names and for substitution of the name of the widow and of herself in those cases. Pending decision of these matters, on the 11th May, 1915, suit No. 120 of 1915 was filed by Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal on the basis of the alleged will of the 13th May, 1913. On the same day an application was made for the appointment of a receiver and an interim order appointing a receiver was passed by the court. On the 18th May, 1915, Mohan Kuer for herself and as guardian of the minor widow made an application praying for the discharge of the receiver. By an order dated the 23rd September, 1915, the receiver was discharged and it was held by the civil judge that the plaintiffs had no prima facie case and that the will propounded by them was a suspicious document. On the 18th December, 1915, suit No. 120 of 1915 was compromised between the parties. This compromise is in the following terms : '1. The plaintiffs relinquish their claim for possession over the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal. The defendants shall have all those rights to the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal, which she had as a Hindu widow according to law. After the death of the two Musammats, the plaintiffs in equal shares and, after them, their heirs, who might have the right of survivorship one after the other, shall be the owners of the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal. The name of Mst. Mohan Kunwar defendant against one half of the property in lieu of maintenance, shall continue. 799 4. Mohan Kunwar and Mst. Khem Kunwar shall have power to do anything they might choose with the entire income from the movable and immovable property, cash, ornaments, amount of decrees and documents, household goods and other movables, which they might have in their possession. The plaintiffs or anyone else shall have no power to interfere or to ask for rendition of accounts. In case Mohan Kunwar defendant dies first, Mst. Khem Kunwar shall, as a Hindu widow, become the owner in possession of the entire property, of which Mst, Mohan Kuer might have been in possession in any way, subject to the provisions of condition No. 4. In ,case Mst. Khem Kuer defendant dies first, Mst, Mohan Kuer shall as a Hindu widow, become the owner in possession of the entire property of which. Mst, Khem Kuer might have been in possession in any way, subject to the provisions of condition No. 4.' In accordance with the terms of this compromise suit No. 120 of 1915 was dismissed. In the proceedings that were pending for substitution of names the court on the 22nd December, 1915, ordered that Khem Kuer and Mohan Kuer be impleaded as legal representatives of the late Shah Chiranji Lal. On the 2nd September, 1918, Khem Kuer brought a suit against her mother-in-law Mohan Kuer for a declaration to the effect that she alone was the lawful heir of Chiranji Lal and was the owner of the property, mentioned in schedule A and that the defendant had no concern with it. This suit was compromised between the parties on the 22nd April, 1919. Mohan Kuer agreed that Khem Kuer 's suit be decreed. Khem Kuer undertook to look after Mohan Kuer in every way and if she desired to live separately from her, she agreed to pay her a sum of Rs. 3000 per annum by way of maintenance. Khem Kuer did not live long after her having become owner of the entire estate of her husband under the terms of this compromise. As stated already, she was murdered on the 28th August, 1919. The estate 104 800 thus became vested in Mohan Kuer both according to Hindu law as well as in accordance with the terms of the compromise of the 18th December, 1915. It is alleged that either on the fourth or the thirteenth day after the death of Khem Kuer, Mohan Kuer when asked about the mutation of the estate, said that she had no concern with it and had relinquished it and had devoted herself to worship. On the 15th September, 1919, an application bearing the signature of Mohan Kuer in Hindi was presented by her mukhtar Chaturbhuj in the court of the subordinate judge at Agra, praying that the sale certificate in suit No. 1919 (Shah Jwala Prasad vs Rai Bahadur Shah Durga Prasad), be prepared in the names of Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, for they were the heirs in possession of the properties of Shah Chiranji Lal. This application (Exhibit N 31) contains the following recital: 'Mst. Khem Kuer died on the 28th of August, 1919. I do not want to take any proceedings in my own name. Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal are the subsequent heirs and it is in their names that all the mutation proceedings etc. are being taken in the revenue court. They have been made the heirs in possession of the entire property and an application has been filed in their names in this court for preparation of the sale certificate. This petitioner has got no objection to the preparation of the sale certificate in their names, for they are the heirs and are in possession of the property.' The sale certificate was prepared accordingly. On the 16th September, 1919, Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal applied for mutation in respect of the lands relating to mauza Somra in the court of the tahsildar of Etmadpur. In column 5 of this application (Exhibit A 14) it was alleged that they were entitled to mutation by right of inheritance. Similar applications were made in respect of other villages also. (Vide Exhibit 128 etc.) Mutations were entered in all the villages on the basis that both of them were heirs in equal shares to the property of the deceased, though according to Hindu law, Shah Jwala Prasad alone was the 801 next heir. During the course of the mutation proceedings one Chintaman, general attorney of Shah Jwala Prasad was examined on the 11th October, 1919 and he stated that Mst. Khem Kuer died on the 28th August, 1919, that Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal were her heirs in equal shares, that Mohan Kuer was the mother-in-law of the deceased and she did not want her name to be recorded and had made relinquishment in favour of Shah Madho Lal and Shah Jwala Prasad in the civil court on the 15th September, 1919. Chaturbhuj, general attorney of Mohan Kuer was examined in the same proceedings on the 27th October, 1919, and he stated that Mohan Kuer did not want her name to be recorded in place of the name of the deceased, that she had no objection to the entry of the names of Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, that she had sent him for making that statement. He admitted the relinquishment filed by Mohan Kuer in the civil court with respect to the property of Mst. Khem Kuer but he was not able to state when that relinquishment had taken place. The tahsildar after recording these statements ordered the mutation of names in favour of the two reversioners (Exhibit M 2). On the 22nd November, 1919, the two reversioners Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, having entered into possession of the estate after the death of Khem Kuer made a gift of property of the value of about Rs. 50,000 in favour of the sisters of Shah Chiranji Lal by means of two deeds of gift. (Vide Exhibit M 16). These gift deeds contain the following recitals : 'Shah Chiranji Lal deceased was the owner of Katariha estate in which besides other villages the villages specified below were also included, and as he had no issue after his death Mst. Khem Kuer became his heir as a Hindu widow of a joint family subject to Mitakshara school of law. On her death we the executants who were entitled to become the absolute owners of the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal according to Shastras became the absolute owner of the entire property 802 of Shah Chiranji Lal by inheriting the estate from him. We obtained possession over everything and mutation of names also were effected in our favour from the revenue court in respect of all villages. Shah Chiranji Lal deceased had two sisters Mst. Ram Kuer and Mst. Prem Kuer and he had a desire during his lifetime to give them some property but owing to sudden death he could not himself fulfil his intention during his lifetime. We the executants accept this fact as desired by him. Besides this the mother of Shah Chiranji Lal also desires the same thing and it is our duty to fulfil the same, and to give property to the Musammats aforesaid is considered to be a pious and good act from the religious point of view. It is our duty also to respect their wishes and fulfil the same, so that the people of our caste and family might not think that after the death of Shah Chiranji Lal his wishes remained unfulfilled. Hence for the reasons set forth above and keeping in view the honour of the family and pious nature of the act we the executants while in a sound state of body and mind . . . make a gift of the following villages in favour of the donees.' The donees subsequently made a number of transfers of the property gifted to them and in every respect the gift deeds were acted upon. Jwala Prasad, the presumptive reversioner, died in the year 1930. In suit No. 49 of 1928 (same as No. 89 of 1929) one Pandit Rikh Ram had obtained a decree against Shah Madho Lal and his sons and they appealed against it to the High Court and also applied for postponement of the preparation of the final decree. Stay was ordered on the applicants furnishing security in the sum of Rs. 20,000 for future interest, costs, etc. On the 26th May, 1930, in compliance with the order of the High Court a security bond was executed by Shah Madho Lal and his sons as first party and by Mst. Mohan Kuer as second party, containing the following recitals : 'After the death of Mst. Khem Kuer Mst. Mohan Kuer was to become the owner of the property with 803 limited interests as a Hindu mother, but she relinquished her inheritance and did not agree to accept any property. By means of a private arrangement, i.e., a family arrangement, it was decided as between Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal that they should be the owners of the property aforesaid in equal shares. Documents in that connection were registered. Thus Shah Madho Lal executant No.1 is the exclusive owner of the property given below which is being pledged and hypothecated under this security bond. Executant No. 4, the second party, has, after hearing and understanding the contents of this security bond, joined in token of the veracity of the facts noted above so that in future she might not be able to take objection to it and so that she might have no objection of any sort to the security bond.' (Executant No. 4 was Mst. Mohan Kuer). On the 30th June, 1930, an affidavit bearing the thumb impression of Mst. Mohan Kuer was filed in the same proceedings containing the following statements : 'I solemnly affirm and say that after the death of Mst. Khem Kuer I did not agree to accept property nor was I the heir and that I relinquished the entire property in favour of Shah Jwala Prasad who became the owner of the entire property which was in possession of Khem Kuer.' The Subordinate Judge expressed the view that the bond could not be held to have been executed by Mohan Kuer, she being a pardanashin lady. He declined to accept the deed as sufficient and valid security. On the 9th July, 1930, the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dismissed the application for stay of proceedings. On the 15th July, 1931, Mohan Kuer instituted suit No. 24 of 1931 in the court of the subordinate judge of Mathura against the widows of Shah Jwala Prasad, Shah Madho Lal and his sons and a number of transferees who had taken the property from these two reversioners. In para 8 of the plaint it was alleged that the plaintiff was an old pardanashin woman, was simple and of weak intellect and illiterate, that on account of the murder of Mst. Khem Kuer, she was very terror stricken and was full of sorrow and had no knowledge about her rights, that the third defendant and Jwala Prasad who wanted to get the property took undue advantage of the plaintiff 's aforesaid condition and unlawfully entered into possession of the property left by Chiranji Lal deceased and caused the mutation of names in their favour. In para. 12 it was said that the defendants had got the thumb impressions of the plaintiff on certain documents without telling her the contents of those papers, simply by saying that a decree for a considerable amount had been passed against the property and it was going to be sold in auction and that a security bond must be furnished for saving the property. She prayed for a decree for possession of the property in dispute in her favour against the defendants. During the pendency of this suit Mohan Kuer died on the 5th December, and on her death an attempt was made by the present plaintiffs to get themselves impleaded as her legal representatives but on the 9th October 1934 it was held that the claim of Mst. Mohan Kuer was of a personal character and the suit therefore could not proceed owing to abatement. It was, however, noted that the legal representatives could file a separate suit, if so advised. It is in consequence of this order that the suit out of which this appeal arises was filed on the 30th April 1936. It was contended by the learned Attorney General that the High Court on mere suspicions and unwarranted assumptions had found the main issues in the case against the appellant and had erroneously held that the compromise in suit No. 120 of 1915 was not binding on the 'plaintiffs and that the surrender by Mohan Kuer was not valid surrender under Hindu law. After hearing the learned counsel at considerable length, we did not think it necessary to hear the respondent in reply, as in our opinion, the decision of the High Court on both the points was right. 805 On the point of surrender, the learned Attorney General contended that the widow effaced herself and put both the reversioners in possession of the property half and half, and agreed to take Rs. 3,000 from them for her maintenance and that the fact of surrender was satisfactorily proved from the conduct of Mohan Kuer in allowing the estate to be mutated in the names of the reversioners and in allowing them to take possession of it, also by the different statements made by her and from the other documentary and oral evidence led in the case. Emphasis was laid on the statements contained in the application (Exhibit M 31), on the statement of her mukhtar Chaturbhuj, and on the recitals of the security bond and the affidavit, Exhibit P 30. Whether Mohan Kuer effaced herself and surrendered the property, or whether she merely abandoned it, or whether she entered into an arrangement for the division of the estate between herself, the two reversioners and the daughters and their sons it is not possible to predicate with any amount of certainty. No definite opinion can be offered on the question whether whatever she did, she did voluntarily after fully realizing the consequences of her act and whether as a pardanashin lady she had been properly advised on the matter or whether she merely acted on sentiment. Considerable doubt is cast on the story of surrender set up by the defendants by the recitals in the two deeds of gift, dated 22nd November, 1919, extracted above. The donors did not base their title to the property either on the compromise of 1915 or on the surrender of Mohan Kuer of the year 1919 or on the will; on the other hand, they said that they had become owners of the property of Chiranji Lal by inheritance under Hindu law after the death of his widow. Both of them could not possibly inherit the property half and half under Hindu law. Moreover, there is no clear or definite evidence of either the time when the arrangement was made or of the terms thereof. The evidence on these points is vague and unsatisfactory. It is completely wanting as to the arrangement under which Mohan Kuer became entitled to receive Rs. 3,000 from them. The conduct of Mohan Kuer and the various statements by her no doubt do indicate that she cut off her connection with the bulk of the estate of Chiranji Lal after the death of the widow and received a sum of Rs. 3,000 from the reversioners and it is also clear that at her instance the reversioners gave property of the value of Rs. 50,000 to her daughters, but in the absence of any satisfactory evidence as to the precise nature of this arrangement it is not possible to conclude that the widow after fully realizing as to what she was doing and after proper advice effaced herself. In this connection the allegations made by her in the suit of 1931 cannot be altogether ruled out from consideration. Assuming however for the sake of argument that Mohan Kuer purported to relinquish her estate in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal, in our opinion, the relinquishment cannot in law operate as an extinction of her title in the estate. The principle underlying the doctrine of surrender is that it cannot possibly be made in favour of anybody except the next heir of the husband. Vesting of the estate in the next reversioner takes place under operation of law and it is not possible for the widow to say that she is withdrawing herself from the husband 's estate in order that it may vest in somebody other than the next heir of the husband. It was held by this court in Mummareddi Nagi Reddi vs Pitti Durairaja Naidu(1) that so far as the next heir is concerned, there cannot be a surrender of the totality of the interest which the widow had, if she actually directs that a portion of it should be held or enjoyed by somebody else other than the husband 's heirs and that the position is not materially altered if the surrender is made in favour of the next heir with whom a stranger is associated and the widow purports to relinquish the estate in order that it may vest in (1) [1951] S.C.R. 655. 807 both of them. Though in the written statements of the two sets of defendants different versions of the character of the arrangement were pleaded, the learned Attorney General before us stated that the surrender by the widow was made both in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal in equal moieties. Madho Lal admittedly was not the next reversioner entitled to succeed to the estate. Thus the surrender of the totality of the interest of the widow was not made in favour of the next heir. That being so, it cannot operate as a valid surrender. If the surrender could be held a valid one, then obviously succession that had opened out in 1919 and vested in the next heirs could not be divested at the instance of the plaintiffs in the year 1932 on the death of Mohan Kuer, but in view of the invalidity of the surrender it has to be held that succession to Shah Chiranji Lal 's estate opened in 1932 and the plaintiffs as next heirs were entitled to take it. The next question for consideration is whether the compromise of 1915 entered into between Mohan Kuer as guardian of Khem Kuer, and the two reversioners who had claimed the estate on the basis of a will, was a bona fide family arrangement and thus binding on the ultimate reversioners, the plaintiffs. It is well settled that when the estate of a deceased Hindu vests in a female heir, a decree fairly and properly obtained against her in regard to the estate is in the absence of fraud or collusion binding on the reversionary heir, but the decree against the female holder must have involved the decision of a question of title and not merely a question of the widow 's possession during her life (vide Venayeck Anundrow vs Luxumeebaee (1). This principle of res judicata is not limited to decrees in suits contested and it is competent to a widow to enter into a compromise in the course of a suit bona fide in the interest of the estate, and not for her personal advantage, and a decree passed on such compromise is binding upon the reversioner. The question whether the transaction (1) 808 is a bona fide settlement of a disputed right between the parties depends on the substance of the transaction and in order that it may bind the estate it should be a prudent and reasonable act in the circumstances of the case. As observed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Ram sumran Prasad vs Shyam Kumari (1), the true doctrine is laid down in Mohendra Nath Biswas vs Shamsunnessa Khatun(2), decided in 1914, and it is that a compromise made bona fide for the benefit of the estate and not for the personal advantage of a limited owner will bind the reversioner quite as much as a decree against her after contest. That being so, we proceed to inquire whether the compromise in the present case is one that can be supported on these principles. In agreement with the High Court we are of the opinion that it cannot be so supported. Mohan Kuer in entering into the compromise on behalf of the minor widow never applied her mind to the interests of the ultimate reversioners. She entered into it for her own personal benefit and for the personal benefit of the minor widow in complete indifference as to what was to happen to the estate after their respective deaths. Under this compromise these two ladies got all the rights they had under Hindu law without sacrificing an iota of their property and then they agreed that after their death the plaintiffs in equal shares and after them their heirs shall be the owners of the estate of Chiranji Lal. It did not matter in the least to the two ladies what was to happen to the estate after their deaths and they were quite willing to let this estate go to the plaintiffs in the suit, though one of them was a remote reversioner. The compromise therefore was made in the interest of the actual parties to the suit in complete disregard of the interests of the ultimate reversioners. The widows undoubtedly acted with reasonableness and prudence so far as their personal interest was concerned but further than that they did not see. The claim, of the two plaintiffs in Suit No. 120 of 1915 was adverse to the interest of the (1) (1922) 49 I.A. 342. (2) 809 reversion as they were claiming as legatees under the will. The widows while entering into the compromise safeguarded their personal rights only and thus in entering into it they only represented themselves and not the estate or the reversioners and surrendered nothing out of their rights, and it cannot be said that in the true sense of the term it was a bona fide settlement of disputed rights where each party gave up something of its own rights to the other. The plaintiffs got an admission from the widows in regard to the future succession of the estate that after their deaths they would succeed though they were not heirs in accordance with Hindu law. By this admission the widows lost nothing whatsoever. Those who lost were the ultimate reversioners and their interest was not in the least either considered or safeguarded. In these circumstances it seems to us that the compromise cannot be held to be a bona fide settlement or family arrangement of disputed rights and was entered into by Mohan Kuer for her personal advantage and of the advantage of Khem Kuer. The present case is analogous to the decision of the Privy Council in Imrit Konwur vs Roop Narain Singh (1). There in a dispute between a person claiming to be an adopted son of the previous owner and the widow and her daughters who would have title after her, the widow gave up her daughters ' rights in consideration of her receiving practically unimpaired what she could. Their Lordships held that such a compromise could not stand, as indeed it was not a compromise at all. The learned Attorney General laid considerable emphasis on the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Mata Prasad vs Nageshar Sahai (2). In that case the widow admitted the right of the reversioner under Act I of 1869 and agreed that succession will be governed by that Act. The reversioner agreed to let her remain in possession and undertook that he would not alienate the property during that period. The widow in that case was not constituted a full owner under Hindu law and she did not get her full rights (1) (2) (1925) 52 I.A.393 810 under the compromise but as a matter of concession was allowed to remain in possession by the reversioner and as a matter of fact she sacrificed her rights to a considerable extent and did not act for her personal benefit at all except to the limited extent mentioned above. In the circumstances of that case it was held that the compromise was a bona fide family settlement of disputed claims and was binding on the reversioners. In the present case the devolution of the property after the death of Chiranji Lal was agreed to be in accordance with Hindu law and that being so, the further devolution of the property after their death was no concern of the widows. That was a matter of law. The ultimate reversioners were stabbed in the back by the widow and such a compromise cannot be held to be binding on them. A large number of cases were cited before us in which compromises under different circumstances had been held to be binding on the reversioners. We consider that it is wholly unnecessary to examine those cases because the circumstances in which those compromises were made were quite different from the circumstances of the present case. Considering all the materials which were placed before us, we hold in agreement with the High Court that the compromise in the present case was neither prudent nor reasonable so far as it affected the interests of the estate and that of the ultimate reversioners and that being so, is not binding on the plaintiffs. For the reasons given above this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. Civil Appeal No. 30 of 1951. This is an appeal by one of the transferees and arises out of the same suit out of which arises appeal No. 29 of 1951. On the 13th June, 1928, Shah Madho Lal and his son Shah Madhusudan Lal executed a sale deed (Exhibit M 13) in favour of the appellant for the sum of Rs. 21,000. The transferee while adopting the defence taken by Madho Lal and by the heirs of Jwala Prasad, pleaded that he was protected by the provisions of section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act. 811 The High Court held that in cases where a person who has allowed another to occupy the position of an ostensible owner has a limited estate, the rule of section 41 applies only during the lifetime of the limited owner and is not available to protect transferees against the claim of the reversioners. A number of authorities were cited in support of this proposition. The learned counsel for the appellant was unable to displace this proposition. It is quite clear that the plea of section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act could only be raised against Mohan Kuer or her legal representatives but is not available against the plaintiff, Mohan Kuer having acquired a limited life estate. This contention is therefore rejected. The learned counsel then contended that the plaintiff Prem Kuer had relinquished her rights in favour of her sons in 1933 and she had no locus standi to maintain the suit or to appeal against the decision of the trial judge as the title to the estate had vested in her sons. The plaintiffs had alleged in para. 13 of the plaint that the relinquishment was inoperative and void. The defendants did not dispute that allegation and it is not open to them at this stage to take up the plea which they could have taken in the trial court or in the appellate court. Even in the grounds of appeal to this court the point was not taken. If the point was taken at the proper stage the plaintiffs might well have proved that the relinquishment was no longer operative or they might have amended the plaint and put it in proper form. The learned counsel adopted the arguments of the learned Attorney General in the other appeal and for the reasons given therein these points are decided against him. This appeal therefore also fails and is dismissed with costs. Appeals dismissed. Agent for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 29 of 1951: S. S. Shukla.

            "judgement": "Appeals Nos. 130 and 131 of 1951. Appeals from the Judgment and Decrees, dated the 12th August, 1948, of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in Appeals from Original Decrees Nos. 214 of 1942 and 231 of 1943 arising from the Decrees, dated the 16th June, 1942, of the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Burdwan, in Money Suit No. 261 of 1932/ Miscellaneous Case No. 132 of 1941 and Money Suit No. 262 of 1932/Miscellaneous Case No. 131 of 1941. N. C. Chatterjee (A. K. Dutt and Sukumar Ghose, with him) for the appellant. Manmohan Mukherjee and P. K. Chatterjee for respondent No. 1. 1954. March 12. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J. These two analogous appeals, which are between the same parties and involve the same points in dispute, are directed against a common judgment of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court dated the 12th of August, 1948, by which the learned Judges affirmed, in appeal, the decision of the Subordinate Judge of Burdwan passed in two analogous proceedings under section 36 of the Bengal MoneyLenders Act. The facts material for our present purpose lie within a narrow compass and may be stated as follows: The principal respondents are certain idols, represented by their managing Shebait Ram Govinda Roy. The idols are the family deities of the Roys of Bonpash in the district of Burdwan, and the number of Shebaits being very large, there is a recognised usage in this family that the seniormost member amongst the descendants of the founder acts as the managing Shebait and it is he who manages the endowed properties and looks after the due performance of the worship of the idols. It is not disputed by the parties that it is within the competence of the managing Shebait to borrow money to meet the necessities of the idols and to execute such documents as may be necessary for that purpose. Admittedly Adwaita Charan Roy was the managing Shebait of the deities from 1926 to 1930 and as Shebait, he executed a Hatchita in favour of one Nanitosh Chakraborty some time in April, 1928, on the basis of which he received advances of money from time to time from the latter. The last entry in the Hatchita was made in March, 1929, and the total amount borrowed up to that date came up to Rs. 3,801. Adwaita died in March, 1930, and after his death, Satish Chandra Roy became the managing Shebait and continued to act as such till his death in 1940. There was an adjustment of accounts between Nanitosh, the creditor, in whose favour the Hatchita was executed, and Satish Chandra, the managing Shebait some time in October, 1931, and a sum of Rs. 5,068, having been found due to the creditor, Satish Chandra gave him a renewed Hatchita for that amount. It appears that while Adwaita was still the managing Shebait, a suit was instituted by some of his co Shebaits to remove him from his office and pending the hearing of the suit, Ramjanaki Roy, another co Shebait, was appointed a Receiver of the debutter property by the court. With the permission of the court, Ramjanaki borrowed from the same Nanitosh Chakraborty three sums of money on three different promissory notes executed respectively on the 27th September, 1929, 1st October, 1929, and 14th January, 1930. The suit was eventually dismissed for non prosecution after Adwaita’s death. Nanitosh died in 1931, and in 1932, his two sons Aditya and Dhirendra, who figure as respondents 14 and 15 in these appeals, instituted two money suits against Satish Chandra, the managing Shebait, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Burdwan, being Money Suits Nos. 261 and 262 of 1932, for recovery of the moneys due in respect of the Hatchita and the promissory notes mentioned aforesaid. Both the suits were decreed on the basis of a compromise dated the 23rd July, 1933, and two consent decrees were passed, one for a sum of Rs. 5,800, and the other for Rs. 2,200, both payable in sixteen yearly instalments with a further stipulation that in default of payment of any one of the instalments, the whole or balance of the decretal amount would become due and payable in each. The instalments not having been paid in either of the cases both the decrees were put into execution. In Execution Cases Nos. 76 and 77 of 1936, arising out of Money Suits Nos. 261 and 262 of 1932, the properties mentioned in Schedule Ka in each case were put up to sale and they were purchased ostensibly by the two decreeholders Aditya and Dhiren. Three years later, Execution Cases Nos. 17 and 18 of 1939 were started again in connection with the said decrees and this time the properties specified in Schedule Kha were attached and put up to sale and they were also purchased by the Chakraborty decreeholders. Finally, in Execution Cases Nos. 163 of 1939 and 5 of 1940, the properties described in Schedule GA were sold and they were knocked down to Srimati Oramba Sundari Dasi, who figures as the appellant in the appeals before us and who, it may be noted, is the wife of Aghore Nath Roy, a son of Adwaita, the former managing Shebait of the debutter estate. Subsequently, the decreeholders, who purchased Ka and Kha Schedule properties sold them by a registered Kobala to the said Oramba Sundari Dasi on the 26th of July, 1940. The result, therefore, was that the properties described in the three Schedules came to vest in Oramba Sundari, the wife of Aghore Nath Roy. On the 28th August, 1941, the deities represented by some of the Shebaits filed two applications under section 36 (6) (a) (ii) of the Bengal Money Lenders Act praying for the reopening of the two compromise decrees mentioned aforesaid and the passing of new installment decrees in accordance with the provisions of the Act. There were prayers also for restoration to the deities of all the properties mentioned in Schedules, Ka, Kha and Ga which were purchased in execution of the decrees. The principal opposite parties to these proceedings were the Chakraborty decreeholders, Oramba Sundari, the ostensible purchaser, and Aghore Nath Roy, her husband. The allegations in the applications, in substance, were that the Chakrabortys were mere benamidars for Aghore Nath Roy, who was the real lender and the real decreeholder in both these suits. It was alleged that Aghore Nath Roy purchased these properties in the benami of the decreeholders in two out of the three execution proceedings and in the benami of his wife Oramba Sundari in the third. The subsequent Kobala executed by the Chakrabortys in favour of Oramba Sundari was also asserted to be a fictitious conveyance made in favour of Aghore Nath Roy in the name of his wife. In these circumstances, the judgment debtors prayed that they were entitled to have the two compromise decrees reopened and on the passing of new instalment decrees to have the properties, which were in possession of the real decreeholder, restored to the deities in terms of section 36(2)(c) of the Bengal Money Lenders Act. The trial judge decided in favour of the judgment debtors and granted their prayers in both the applications. Orders were made for reopening of the decrees and making of fresh decrees in their places in accordance with the provisions of the Bengal Money Lenders Act. Direction was also given for restoration of the properties mentioned in Schedules Ka, Kha and Ga to the deities under the provision of section 36(2)(c). Against this decision, Oramba Sundari took two appeals to the High Court of Calcutta and the learned Judges, who heard the appeals, affirmed the decision of the court below and dismissed both the appeals. Oramba Sundari has now come up in appeal to this court on the strength of a certificate given by the High Court under sections 109 (a) and 110 of the Civil Procedure Code. Mr. Chatterjee who appeared in support of the appeals, has not challenged before us the findings of fact concurrently arrived at by the courts below, viz., that the appellant Oramba Sundari was a mere benamidar for her husband Aghore in respect of the purchase of Ga Schedule properties in court sale, and also that the Kobala executed by the Chakrabortys in her favour on July 26, 1940, was a fictitious transaction. The point, which he has pressed for our consideration, is that in a proceeding under section 36 of the Bengal Money Lenders Act, it is not open to the court to go behind the decree and launch an enquiry as to whether the decreeholders on record were in fact benamidars for another person. In other words, the contention is that, even if Aghore was proved to have advanced the money upon which the Chakrabortys obtained the decrees, in reopening the decrees and in working out the rights of the parties in accordance with the provisions of the Bengal Money Lenders Act the court could treat the Chakrabortys alone as the decreeholders. For a proper determination of this point, it is necessary to examine the scope of section 36 of the Bengal Money Lenders Act and the reliefs which the Court is competent to grant in terms of that section. Section 36 of the Bengal Money Lenders Act sets out the various powers which the court can exercise, if it has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers will give relief to the borrower as contemplated by the Act; and one of the powers, which is mentioned in clause (a) of sub section (1) of the section is to reopen any transaction and take an account between the parties. The drafting of section 36 is indeed obscure and somewhat clumsy, but it is clear, as the Privy Council (1) has pointed out, that the power of reopening a transaction, as contemplated by the section, extends to reopening of decrees as well. Sub section (2) of section 36 contains detailed provisions as to what the court may or may not do when a decree is reopened. It cannot be disputed that the court reopens a decree under section 36(2) only for the purpose and so far as it is necessary to give relief to the borrower in the manner provided for in the Act, namely, to release him from all liability for interest in excess of the limits prescribed by section 30 of the Act. A new decree is passed only for the purpose of substituting the method of accounting sanctioned by the Act for the calculations upon which the original decree was passed and to give an opportunity to the judgment debtor to pay the decretal dues thus ascertained by instalments. But save and except for these, the old decree as well as the adjudications made thereunder are not wiped out and the parties are not relegated to their rights and liabilities under the original cause of action (2). How the rights of the parties are to be adjusted and worked out when a decree has been reopened has been dealt with exhaustively in the several clauses of section 36 (2) of the Bengal Money Lenders Act, and an examination of these clauses makes it clear to our minds that an enquiry as to whether the decreeholder was in fact a benamidar for another person in respect of the decree, does not come within the purview of these provisions. Clause (a) of section 36(2) empowers the court to pass a new decree in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Obviously, this new decree is to be passed in favour of the original decreeholder and only the calculations upon which the old decree was based would be changed by substituting the statutory method of accounting in place of what rested upon the contract between the parties. Clauses (b) and (c) contemplate cases where properties have been sold in execution of the original decree. If the purchaser is the decreeholder himself and he is in possession of the property when the decree is reopened, it is incumbent upon the court to order restoration of these properties to the judgment debtor under clause (c). If, on the other hand, the properties had been acquired by strangers either by purchase at the execution sale or from the decreeholder purchaser, their interests would be protected if they have acquired these rights bona fide as contemplated by clause (b). Under clause (d), the court has to order the payment of the decretal amount in such instalments as it thinks proper, and clause (e) further imposes a duty on the court to give a direction in such cases that if there is default in the payment of any one of the instalments, the properties restored to the judgment debtor under clause (c) would be put back into the possession of the decreeholder. It is quite true that the object of restoring possession of the properties sold in execution of the decree to the judgment debtor is to enable the latter to pay off the decretal dues, but it is to be remembered that the sale itself is not annulled, and in case of default in payment of any of the instalments, the properties are returned to the decreeholder purchaser. We agree that if the purchaser is a mere benamidar for the decreeholder, clause (b), subsection (2) of the section would not afford protection to him in any way. He could not be regarded as a person other than the decreeholder acquiring rights bona fide as contemplated by that clause. For the purpose of giving effect to clauses (b) and (c), therefore, the court has not only the right but is under a duty to make an enquiry as to whether the ostensible purchaser at the execution sale, or the person who purports to have acquired an interest therein under a subsequent transfer from the decreeholder purchaser, has bona fide acquired such rights within the meaning of clause (b). But we do not agree with the learned Judges of the High Court that in making a new decree under clause (a) of section 36(2) and giving the judgment debtor consequential relief under clause (c) of the subsection, the court can at all enter into the question as to whether the decreeholder on record is himself a benamidar for another person in respect of the decree. Such enquiry, it seems to us, is altogether outside the purview of the different clauses of section 36(2) of the Bengal Money Lenders Act. These provisions do not recognise any other decreeholder than the one in whose favour the original decree was passed. It is between him and the judgment debtor that the rights are to be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Act; to him would the instalments have to be paid under the new decree, and he alone would be compelled to restore the properties which he had purchased in execution proceedings. None but the decreeholder on record can give a valid discharge or record satisfaction of the decree. This being the position, it is altogether immaterial, in our opinion, that it was Aghore, the husband of the appellant, who really advanced the money upon which the decrees were obtained. We must treat the Chakrabortys and the Chakrabortys alone as the decreeholders and see to what extent the provisions of the Act could be applied against them in the circumstances of the present case. So far as the properties described in Schedules Ka and Kha are concerned, it is not disputed that they were purchased by the decreeholders themselves. No price was actually paid by the decreeholders, but the sale proceeds were set off against the decretal dues. The decreeholders, therefore, must be deemed to be the purchasers of these properties within the meaning of clause (c) of section 36(2); and as the subsequent conveyance of these properties in favour of Oramba Sundari, the appellant, has been held by both the courts below to be a fictitious transaction, we must hold that Oramba Sundari did not bona fide acquire any right which could be protected under clause (b) of section 36(2). With regard to these properties, therefore, the order for restoration of possession made by both the courts below should stand. As regards Ga Schedule properties, however, Oramba Sundari was the purchaser at the execution sale and whether or not the money for such purchase was paid by her husband becomes immaterial. This was not the property purchased by the decreeholders and there is no proof of the decreeholders being in possession of the same either by themselves or through Oramba Sundari. In these circumstances, clause (c) of section 36(2) cannot be attracted in favour of judgment debtors so far as this property is concerned and the possession of it must remain with the appellant. We, therefore, allow the appeal in part and set aside the order for restoration of possession made by the courts below in respect to the Ga Schedule property. The rest of the decision of the High Court will stand. We make no order as to costs of these appeals. Appeal partly allowed.",

            "judgement": "No. 11 of 1967. Petition under article 32 of the Constitution of India for the enforcement of fundamental rights. N. C. ChatterJee, K. B. Rohtagi and section BalakriShnan, for Petitioner. C. K. Daphtary, Attorney General, A. section Nambiar, R. H. Dhebar and section P. Nayar, for the respondents. K. B. Rohtagi, for the interveners. 723 Ramaswami, J. In this case the petitioner, C. A. Rajendran has obtained rule from this Court calling upon the respondents to show cause why a writ in the nature of mandamus under article 32 of the Constitution should not be issued for quashing the office Memorandum dated November 8, 1963 which is Annexure C ' to the Writ Petition, and for directing respondent No. 1 to restore the orders passed by it in Office Memorandum No. 2 /11/ 55 RPS dated May 7, 1955 and No. 5/4/55 SCT (1) dated January 4, 1957. Cause has been shown by the Attorney General on behalf of the respondents to whom notice of the rule was ordered to be given. The petitioner is a permanent Assistant in Grade IV (Class 11, non gazetted ministerial) of the Railway Board Secretariat Service. He was initially appointed as Accounts Clerk on February 6, 1953 in Southern Railway. He was appointed as an Assistant on October 22, 1956 in the Railway Board and confirmed as Assistant on April 1, 1960. The pay scale of the Assistant 's grade is Rs. 210 530. The next post to which the petitioner claims promotion is that of the Section Officer in the same service. The post of Section Officer is classified as Class II, Grade 11, Gazetted and it carries a pay scale of Rs. 350 900. The Railway Board Secretariat Service (Reorganisation and Reinforcement) Scheme was drawn up in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs and introduced with effect from December 1, 954 with the approval of the Union Public Service Commission. According to the new Scheme the Railway Board Secretariat Service consists of the following grades: 'Grade IV Assistants in the scale of Rs. 210 530 (Class III non gazetted) (to which Petitioner belongs). Grade III Section Officers in the scale of Rs. 350 900 (Class II gazetted) with effect from 1 7 1959. (Section Offcers grade). Grade II Amalgamated with effect from 1 7 1959 as Section Officers grade. Grade I Assistant Directors/Under Secretaries in the scale of Rs. 900 1,250. (Grade III was called, before 1 7 59, Assistant Superintendent in the scale of Rs. 275 500 and the scale of Grade II Superintendents was Rs. 530 800).' L/P(N)7SCI 7 724 Recruitment to permanent vacancies of Grade III of the Rail way Board Secretariat Service are made by the following three methods as per para 18 of the Railway Board Secretariat Service Scheme: '(a) 33 1/3% by direct recruitment on the results of the combined Examinations held by the UPSC for the IAS, IPS & other Central Services Class I and Class 11. (b) 33 1/3% by promotion on the basis of seniority subject to the rejection of the unfit. (c) 33 1/3% by limited competitive examination on the basis of a test to be prescribed and conducted, by the UPSC for Assistants/Stenographers Grade 11 between 5 years and 10 years of service in the grade in the Board 's office. Note For the years 1961 65 only 1/4 of the substantive vacancies were to be filled by direct recruitment on the results of the competitive examination under item (a) above.' In 1955 the Government issued Office Memorandum dated May 7, 1955 (Annexure 'E ' to the Writ Petition) whereby it reaffirmed its decision that there will be no reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in posts filled by promotion but that certain concessions were to be given to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the matter of promotion. The concessions were as follows: '(i) While there would be no reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in regard to vacancies filled by promotion, where the passing of tests or examinations had been laid down as a condition for promotion, the authority prescribing the rules for the tests or examinations might issue suitable instructions to ensure that the standard of qualification in respect of members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was not unduly high. (ii) Where promotions were made on the basis of seniority subject to fitness, cases of persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were to be judged in a sympathetic manner without applying too rigid a standard and cases of supersession of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes employees reviewed at a high level viz., if a, Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes employee was superseded in the matter of promotion to Class I and II posts filled on the basis of seniority subject to fitness, the prior orders of the Minister or Deputy Minister concerned were to be taken. If, however, the supersession was in a Class III or IV post filled on the basis of seniority subject to fitness, the matter was to be reported to the Minister or Deputy Minister concerned within a month of the decision. (Ministries were given powers to modify this procedure to suit their requirements with the approval of the Minister in charge)' In 1957 the Government decided that there should be provision for reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in all grades of services filled by promotion through competitive examination limited to departmental candidates, the quantum of reservation being 12 1/2% for Scheduled Castes and 5% for Scheduled Tribes. The order of the Government is contained in Office Memorandum dated January 4, 1957, Annexure 'D ' to the Writ Petition. In April, 1959 the Ministry of Railways issued an order laying down that in the case of any promotion from Class IV to Class III and from Class III to Class 11 and for any promotion from one grade to another in Class 111, where such promotions were made by 'selection' and not on the basis of ' seniority cum fitness', there should be reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on the same scale as in the direct recruitment. This order was challenged by Rangachari by a Writ Petition under article 226 of the Constitution which was allowed by the Madras High Court and a writ in the nature of mandamus was granted restraining the Railway Authorities from giving effect to the order of the Railway Board directing reservation of selection posts in Class III of the Railway service in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. An appeal was brought to this Court by the General Manager, Southern Railway (The General Manager, Southern Railway vs Rangachari)(1) against the judgment of the Madras High Court and it was held in the majority judgment of this Court that the impugned circulars of the Railway Board were within the ambit of article 16(4) of the Constitution and the appeal must succeed. Consequent upon the judgment in this case the matter was reviewed by the Union Government and it was advised that there was no constitutional compulsion to make reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in posts filled by promotion and the question whether the reservation should be continued or withdrawn Was entirely a matter of public policy. The Union Government came to the conclusion that there should not be any special treatment of Government servants belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the matter of promotions particularly in promotion to Class I and Class II services which require higher degree of efficiency and responsibility. As a result of this review of the matter the Central Government issued a memorandum dated November 8, 1963 (Annexure 'C ' to the Writ Petition) which reads as follows: 'In posts filled by promotion through competitive examinations limited to departmental candidates, reservations at 12 1/2 per cent and 5 1/2 per cent of vacancies were provided for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively vide this Ministry 's O.M. No. 5/4/ 55 SCT(1) dated 4th January, 1957 and para 3(iii) of the Brochure issued with O.M. No. 1/2/61 SCT(1) dated 27th April, 1962. In regard to promotions on the basis of seniority subject to fitness, and those by selection no reservations were provided, but certain concessions were allowed to persons belonging to scheduled ca stes and scheduled tribes vide Ministry of Home Affairs Office Memorandum No. 2/11/55 RPS dated 7th May, 1955 (as amended from time to time), No. 1/1/59 RPS dated 17th March, 1958 and No. 1/4/60 RPS dated 5th March 1960 and paras 20 and 21 of the aforesaid brochure. The Government of India have reviewed their policy in regard to reservations and other concessions granted to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in posts filled by promotion and have, in supersession of all previous orders in this regard, decided as follows: (1) Class I and Class II appointments: (a) There will be no reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in appointments made by promotion to a Class 11 or a higher service of post whether on the basis of seniority cum fitness, selection, or competitive examination limited to departmental candidates. (b) In the case of promotions made in or to Class I or Class II on the basis of seniority subject to fitness, cases involving supersession of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe Officers, will, however, continue to be submitted for prior approval of the Minister or Dy. Minister concerned. (2) Class III and Class IV appointments: (a) In the cases of Class III and Class IV appointments, in grades or services to which there is no direct recruitment whatever, there will be reservation at 121 and, 5 per cent vacancies for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes respectively in promotions made by (i) selection or (ii) on the results of competitive examinations limited to departmental candidates. (b) Lists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Officers should be drawn up separately to fill the reserved vacancies; officers belonging to these classes will be adjudged separately and not along with other officers and if they should be included in the list irrespective of their merit as compared to that of the other officers '. Promotions against reserved vacancies will continue to be subject to the candidates satisfying the prescribed minimum standards. (e) There will be no reservation in appointments made by promotion on the basis of seniority subject to fitness; but cases involving supersession of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Officers, if any, will as at present be reported within a month to the Minister or Deputy Minister concerned for information. The above decisions take effect from the date of issue of these orders except where selections by the Departmental Promotion Committee under the old orders have already been made, or rules for a competitive examination published.' The contention of the petitioner is that this Office Memorandum (Annexure 'C ' to the Writ Petition) violates the guarantee given to backward classes under article 16(4) of the Constitution and is illegal and ultra vires. It was alleged that the impugned Office Memorandum (Annexure 'C ') made a discrimination by making provision for reservations in certain types of Class III and IV Services only and not in Class II and I Services, and the classification was discriminatory and there was no rational nexus sought to be achieved by the impugned Office Memorandum. The argument was also stressed that, Art ' 16(4) was not an exception engrafted on article 16, but was in itself a fundamental right granted to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and backward classes and as such it was untrammelled by any other provision of the Constitution. The petitioner accordingly prays for the grant of a writ in the nature of mandamus quashing the Office Memorandum (Annexure 'C ') and directing respondent No. 1 to restore retrospectively the orders made in its Office Memoranda No. 2/ 11/55 R.PS dated May 7, 1955 and No. 5/4/55 SCT I dated January 4, 1957 and, to consider the claim of the petitioner as member of the Scheduled taste for promotion as Section Officer in the Railway Board Secretariat Service. Article 14 of the Constitution states: 'The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.' 728 Article 15 provides: '(1). The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. (2) (3) (4) Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Sche duled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.' Article 16 is to the following effect: '(1) There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State. (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place 'of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State. (3) (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the 'opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State. (5) Article 335 reads as follows: 'The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.' The first question to be considered in this case is whether there is a constitutional duty or obligation imposed upon the Union Government to make reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes either at the initial stage of recruitment and at the stage of promotion in the Railway Board Secretariat Service Scheme. The relevant law on the subject 'is well settled,. Under article 16 of the Constitution, there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State or to promotion from one office to a higher office thereunder. Articles 14, 15 and 16 from part of the 729 same constitutional code of guarantees and supplement each other. In other words, article 16 of the Constitution is only an incident of the application of the concept of equality enshrined. in article 14 thereof. It gives effect to the doctrine of equality in the matter of appointment and promotion. It follows therefore that there can be a reasonable classification of the employees for the purpose of appointment and promotion. To put it differently, the equality of opportunity guaranteed by article 16(1) means equality as between members of the same class of employees, and not equality between members of separate, independent classes. Dealing with the extent of protection of article 16(1) of the Constitution, this Court stated in General Manager, Southern Railway vs Rangachari(1) at pages 596 597 of the Report as follows: 'It would, be clear that matters relating to employment cannot be confined only to the initial matters prior to the act of employment. The narrow construction would confine the application of article 16(1) to the initial employment and nothing else; but that clearly is only one of the matters relating to employment. The other matters relating to employment would inevitably be the provision as to the salary and periodical increments therein, terms as to leave, as to gratuity, as to pension and as to the age of superannuation. These are all matters relating to employment and they are, and must be. deemed to be included in the expression 'matters relating to employment ' in Article 16(1). What Article 16(1) guarantees is equality of opportunity to all citizens in respect of all the matters relating to employment illustrated by us as well as to an appointment to any office as explained by us. The three provisions Article 16(1), article 14 and article 15(1) form part of the same constitu tional code of guarantees and supplement each other. If that be so, there would be no difficulty in holding that the matters relating to employment must include all matters in relation to employment both prior and subsequent, to the employment which are incidental to the employment and form part of the terms and conditions of such employment.' The Court further observed in that case: 'Article 16(2) prohibits discrimination and thus assures the effective enforcement of the fundamental right of equality of opportunity guaranteed by Article 16(1). The words, in respect of any employment used in Article 16(2) must, therefore, include all matters relating to employment as specified in Article 16(1). There fore, we are satisfied that promotion to selection posts is included both under Article 16(1) and (2)'. (1) ; , 730 It is manifest that the scope of cl. (4) of article 16 is not co extensive with the guarantee of equality offered to all citizens by cl. (1) of that Article. In other words, cl. (4) of article 16 does not cover the entire field covered by cls. (1) and (2) of that Article. For instance, some of the matters relating to employment in respect of which equality of opportunity has been guaranteed by cls. (1) and (2) do not fall within the mischief of the exception cl. As regards the conditions of service relating to employment such as salary, increment, gratuity, pension and age of superannuation, there can be no exception even in regard to the backward classes of citizens. The only matter which cl. (4) covers is a provision for the reservation of appointments in favour of a backward, class of citizens. It is well settled that cl. (4) of Art.16 is an exception clause and is not an independent provision and it has to be strictly construed (See the judgment of this Court in General Manager, Southern Railway vs Rangachari)(2). It is also apparent that the language of article 16(4) has to be interpreted in the context and background of article 335 of the Constitution. In other words, in making a provision for reservation of appointments or posts the Government has to take into consideration not only the claims of the members of the backward classes but also the maintenance of efficiency of administration which is a matter of paramount importance. In this connection, GaJendragadkar, J., as he then was, speaking for the majority in General Manager, Southern Railway vs Rangachari,(1) observed at page 606 of the Report as follows: 'It is true that in providing for the reservation of appointments or posts under article 16(4) the State has to take into consideration the claims of the members of the backward classes consistently with the maintenance of the efficiency of administration. It must not be forgotten that the efficiency of administration is of such paramount importance that it would be unwise and impermissible to make any reservation at the cost of efficiency of administration. That undoubtedly is the effect of article 335. Reservation of appointments or posts may theoretically and, conceivably mean some impairment of efficiency; but the risk involved in sacrificing efficiency of administration must always be borne in mind when any State sets about making a provision for reservation of appointments or posts. It is also true that the reservation which can be made under article 16(4) is intended merely to give adequate representation to backward communities. It cannot be used for creating monopolies or for unduly or illegitimately disturbing the legitimate interests of other employees. In exercising the powers under article 16(4) the problem of adequate representation of the back ward class of citizens must be fairly and objectively considered and an attempt must always be made to strike a reasonable balance between the claims of backward classes and the claims of other employees as well as the important consideration of the efficiency of administration.' The same view has been reiterated in a later case, M. R. Balaji and Others vs State of Mysore(1), in which Gajendragadkar, J., as he then was, speaking for the unanimous Court stated as follows: 'Whilst we are dealing with this question, it would be relevant to add that the provisions of article 15(4) are similar to those of article 16(4) which fell to be considered in the case of The General Manager, Southern Railway vs Rangachari ([1962] 2 S.C.R. 586). In that case, the majority decision of this Court held that the power of reservation which is conferred on the State under article 16(4) can be exercised by the State in a proper case not only by providing for reservation of appointments, but also by providing for reservation of selection posts. This conclusion was reached on the basis that it served to give effect to the intention of the Constitution makers to make adequate safeguards for the advancement of Backward Classes and to securer their adequate representation in the Services. The judgment shows that the only point which was raised for the decision of this Court in that case was whether the reservation made was outside article 16(4) and that posed the bare question about the construction of article 16(4). The propriety, the reasonableness or the wisdom of the impugned order was not questioned, because it was not the respondent 's case that if the order was justified under article 16(4), it was a fraud on the Constitution. Even so, it was pointed out in the judgment that the efficiency of administration is of such a paramount importance that it would be unwise and impermissible to make any reservation at the cost of efficiency of administration; that, it was stated, was undoubtedly the effect of article 335. Therefore, what is true in regard to article 15(4) is equally true in regard to article 16(4). There can be no doubt that the Constitution makers assumed, as they were entitled to, that while making adequate reservation under article 16(4), care would be taken not to provide for unreasonable, excessive or extravagant reservation, for that would, by eliminating general competition in a large filed and by creating widespread dissatisfaction amongst the employees, materially affect efficiency. Therefore, (1) [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 439. 732 like the special provision improperly made under article 15(4), reservation made under article 16(4) beyond the permissible and legitimate limits would be liable to be challenged as a fraud on the Constitution.' In the present case the respondents have alleged in the counteraffidavit that after the decision of Rangachari 's(1) case the Union Government reviewed the whole position and decided that there should not be any special treatment to Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the matter of promotion to Class I and Class II Services which require higher degree of efficiency and responsibility. It was stated in the counter affidavit that the Union Government was satisfied that reservation quotas of promotion were harmful from the point of view of efficiency of Railway Service and therefore the Government issued the memorandum dated November 8, 1963 withdrawing the reservation quotas for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes officers made in the previous Government orders. On behalf of the petitioner Mr. N. C. Chatterjee submitted the argument that the provision contained in article 16(4) of the Constitution was in itself a fundamental right of Scheduled Castes and, Scheduled Tribes and it was not open to the Government to withdraw the benefits conferred on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by the Government orders dated May 7, 1955 and January 4, 1957. The learned Counsel based his argument on the following observations of Subba Rao, J., as he then was, in the minority judgment of this Court in T. Devadasan vs The Union of India and Another(1): 'The expression 'nothing in this article ' is a legislative device to express its intention in a most emphatic way that the power conferred thereunder is not limited in any way by the main provision but falls outside it. It has not really carved out an exception, but has preserved a power untrammelled by the other provisions of the Article.' But the majority judgment of this Court in that case took the view that article 16(4) was an exception and it could not be so construed as to render nugatory or illusory the guarantee conferred by article 16(1). It was pointed out that though under article 16(4) of the Constitution a reservation of a reasonable percentage of posts for members of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes was within the competence of the State, the method evolved by the Government must be such as to strike a reasonable balance between the claims of the backward classes and claims of other employees, in order to effectuate the guarantee contained in article 16(1). and for this purpose each year of recruitment would have to be considered by itself. Accordingly, the Court struck down the 'Carry forward rule' on the ground that it contravened articles 14, 16 and 335 of the Constitution. In any case, even the minority judgment of Subba Rao, J. does not support the contention of Mr. N. C. Chatterjee that article 16(4) confers a right on the backward classes and not merely a power to be exercised at the discretion of the Government for making a provision for reservation of appointments for backward classes which, in its opinion, are not adequately represented in the Services of the State. Our conclusion therefore is that article 16(4) does not confer any right on the petitioner and there is no constitutional duty imposed on the Government to make a reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, either at the initial stage of recruitment or at the stage of promotion. In other words, article 16(4) is an enabling provision and confers a discretionary power on the State to make a reservation of appointments in favour of backward class of citizens which, in its opinion, is not adequately represented in the Services of the State. We are accordingly of the opinion that the petitioner is unable to make good his submission on this aspect of the case. We shall next deal with the contention of the petitioner that there is discrimination between the employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Railway Service and similar employees in the Central Secretariat Service. It was said that the competitive departmental examination for promotion to the grade of Section Officers was not held by the Railway Board for the years 1955 1963. On the contrary, such examinations were held for the Central Secretariat Service and 74 employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes secured the benefit of the provisions of reservation. In our opinion, there is no substance in this contention. The petitioner being an employee of the Railway Board ' is governed by the rules applicable to the officers in the Service to which he belongs. The employees of the Central Secretariat Service belong to a different class and it is not possible to accept the argument that there is any discrimination against the petitioner and violation of the guarantee under article 14 of the Constitution. It was also contended by Mr. N. C. Chatterjee that the im pugned order, Annexure 'C ', arbitrarily discriminates among Class III employees themselves and Class IV employees them selves. Under the impugned order reservation is kept for appointments for which there is direct recruitment and for promotions made by (1) selection, or (2) on the result of a competitive examination limited to departmental candidates. There is no reservation for appointments made by promotion on the basis of seniority cum fitness. In our opinion, there is no justification for this argument as it is well established that there can be a reasonable classification of employees for the purpose of appointment by promotion and the classification as between direct recruits and promotees is reasonable (See the decisions of this Court in Mervyn Coutindo vs Collector of Customs(1), Bombay, and in section G. Jaisinghani vs Union of India(2). A grievance was also made by Mr. N. C. Chatterjee that there is discrimination as between Classes I and II where there is no reservation and Classes III and TV where reservation has been made for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The respondent stated in the counter affidavit that in Classes I and II posts a higher degree of efficiency and responsibility was required and therefore reservation was considered harmful so far as Classes I and II were concerned. In view of the requirement of efficiency in the higher echelons of Service it is obvious that the classification made in the impugned order is reasonable and the argument of Mr. Chatterjee on this point must also be rejected as untenable. For the reasons expressed we hold that the petitioner has made out no case for the grant of a writ under article 32 of the Constitution. The application accordingly fails but, in the circumstances of the case, we do not propose to make any order as to costs. R.K.P.S. Appeal dismissed.",

            "judgement": "Appeal No. 580 of 1962. Appeal from the judgment and decree dated May 1, 1961, of the Madras High Court in Writ Petition No. 975 of 1959. R.M. Seshadri and R. Gopalakrishnan, for the appellant. R. Ganapathy Iyer, for respondent No. 1. A. Ranganadham Chetty and A. V. Rangam, for respondent No. 2. March 3, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR, J. This appeal comes before us by virtue of a certificate of fitness granted by the High Court of Madras under article 133(1)(c) of the Constitution against its judgment dismissing a petition filed by the appellant under article 226 of the Constitution seeking a writ of prohibition against the Corporation of Madras challenging the constitutional validity of a notice requiring the appellant to pay profession tax. The appellant held office as the last Governor General of India. Under section 3 of Central Act XXX of 1951 the appellant is entitled to a pension of Rs. 15,000 per annum and has been drawing this sum residing in the city of Madras. The Corporation of Madras the first respondent before us demanded profession tax from the appellant under section 111(1)(b) of the City Municipal Act, 1919 hereinafter called the Act for the year 1958-1959 on the ground of the appellant's residence within the city for the period therein specified and his drawing the pension to which he was entitled. The appellant addressed a communication to the Corporation asserting that this demand was illegal as the Corporation was empowered by the relevant constitutional provisions merely to levy a tax 'on a profession, trade, calling or employment' and that as he as a pensioner did not fall under any of these classes, the said demand was illegal. The authorities of the Corporation, however, insisted on compliance with the demand on the ground that under the express terms of the Act persons in receipt of pensions were also liable to the tax. The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition for the relief already set out, and as the validity of the State Act was impugned impleaded the State of Madras also as a respondent. It would be seen from the foregoing that the question for consideration is whether the 1st respondent Corporation is entitled to levy a tax on pensioners in respect of the pensions received by them. In order to appreciate the submissions made to us by learned Counsel for the appellant it would be necessary to set out the history of the legislation in relation to profession tax and the impugned tax on persons in receipt of pensions applicable to the City of Madras because it is on a construction of these provisions that the learned Judges of the High Court have upheld the validity of the levy and dismissed the appellant's writ petition. For this purpose it is not necessary to travel to any period anterior to the enactment of the Madras City Municipal Act (Madras Act IV of 1919) which with certain amendments to be referred to presently is still in force. The Act received the assent of the Governor on March 26, 1919, of the Governor General in June, 1919 and came into force on publication in the Gazette which was in the same month. Having been enacted while the powers of the Local Legislatures were governed by the Government of India Act, 1915, the constitutional validity of the legislation is not open to any challenge. Section 111(1) of this enactment ran 'Every person not liable for the companies' tax who, within the city and for the period prescribed in Sec. 113, exercises a profession, art, trade or calling or holds an appointment, public or private, bringing him within one or more of the classes of persons specified in the taxation rules in Schedule IV shall pay by way of licence fee and in addition to any other licence fee that may be leviable under this Act a tax as determined under the said rules but in no case exceeding rupees five hundred in the half year and such tax may be described as the profession tax.' The Section had two explanations of which the second is material and this reads: Explanation 2 'A person in receipt of a pension paid from any source shall be deemed to be a person holding an appointment within the meaning of this section.' The next change in the relevant provision was effected by Madras City Municipal Amendment Act, 1936 (Madras Act X of 1936) which came into force on 14th April 1936. By this amendment a new section section III was substituted, for the old one just set out, and under this Explanation (2) was deleted and the substituted provision ran: 'III(1). If the Council by a resolution determines that a profession tax shall be levied, every person not liable to the tax, on companies, who after the date specified in the notice published under sub sec. (2) of Sec. 98 A in any half year (a) exercises a profession, art or calling or transacts business or holds any appointment, public or private (i) within the city for not less than sixty days in the aggregate, or (ii) outside the city but who resides in the city for not less than sixty days in the aggregate; or (b) resides in the city for not less than sixty days in the aggregate and is in receipt of any pension or income from investments, shall pay in addition to any licence fee that may be leviable under this Act, a half yearly tax assessed in accordance with the rules in Schedule IV in no case exceeding rupees five, hundred.' Along with this was added a new section section 98 A which ran: Sec. 98 A(1): 'Before the council passes any resolution imposing a tax or duty for the first time it shall direct the Commissioner to publish a notice in the Fort St. George Gazette and in the local papers of its intention and fix a reasonable period not being less than one month from the date of publication of such notice in the Fort St. George Gazette for submission of objections. The Council may, after considering the objections, if any, received within the period specified, determine by resolution to levy the tax or duty. Such resolution shall specify the rate at which, the date from which and the period of levy, if any, for which such tax or duty shall be levied. When the Council shall have determined to levy any tax or duty for the first time or at a new rate the Commissioner shall forthwith publish a notice in the manner laid down in sub section (1) specifying the date from which the rate at which and the period of levy, if any, for which such tax or duty shall be levied.' At this stage it is necessary to refer to Schedule IV in accordance with which the tax has to be assessed under the terms of section 111(1). In the Act as enacted in 1919 the relevant rule in Schedule IV divided persons assessed to profession tax etc. into 8 classes, based upon the amount of monthly salary received in the case of those holding appointments, and income derived in the case of those in trade, art calling etc. Each of these classes was again sub divided into two the first sub class comprising 'Persons holding appointments upon a monthly salary' and the other of 'persons exercising any profession, trade, art, calling or transacting business'. It would be seen that having regard to Explanation 2 to section 111, as it stood in 1919, before its amendment by Act X of 1936 by reason of the provision which enacted that 'persons in receipt of pension' were deemed to be 'persons holding appointments' when the rule in Schedule IV referred to 'persons holding appointments' it included by the statutory fiction pensioners who on the basis of the amount of pension which they derived were classified as 'persons holding appointments' under the various classes. But when this Explanation to section Ill was deleted by the Amending Act X of 1936 and when the new section 111(1)(b) referred to the 'half yearly tax assessed in accordance with rules in Schedule IV, it was urged that there could not have been an assessment of persons in receipt of pension unless they could be comprehended as within the category of persons holding appointments, or of persons exercising any profession, trade, or art or calling, as these were the only classes relevant to the present purpose who were within the scope of the rules under Schedule IV. We shall refer to the submission based on this feature as regards the terminology employed in Schedule IV in its proper place. The Corporation of Madras availed itself of the provisions of section 98 A and after the issue of the notices prescribed by it passed a resolution at a meeting held on March 31, 1937 to levy inter alia 'profession tax' for the year 1937-38 at the rates which were specified in the resolution. As regards 'profession tax', the resolution read: 'Resolved that the profession tax in respect of clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 be fixed at the maximum rate and 25 per cent over and above the minimum rates prescribed in Schedule IV of the Act in respect of clauses 7, 8 and 9.' This resolution further specified that the tax at the rates therein set out which were higher than what prevailed before, were to have effect from April 1, 1937. Notwithstanding the apparent inapplicability of the rules in Schedule IV to the levy of profession tax on pensioners, the Corporation continued to assess pensioners to the said tax and collected the same. The lacuna in the enactment was apparently noticed in 1942 when by a notification in the Official Gazette the Schedule was amended in exercise of the powers conferred on Government by section 347(3) of the Act. Under the amendment instead of the words 'Persons holding any appointment or persons exercising profession, trade or calling etc.' the classes were divided, on the basis of 'the half yearly income received by the individual specified in section 111(1)'. This amendment to the Schedule was directed to come into force from April 1, 1942. The relevant terms of Schedule IV have continued up to date in the same form as amended in 1942 only the rate of tax has been progressively increased; first in 1950, then in 1958 and again in 1961, but in the view we take of the principal contention raised by the appellant it is not necessary to set out or deal with these increases. Pausing here the ground upon which the demand for 'profession tax' made by the Corporation was impugned may be briefly stated. The power of the Corporation to levy the tax is dependent on the subject of the tax being within State legislative power under the Constitution. The relevant entry in the Legislative Lists conferring taxing power on the State under which alone, if possible, the present levy could be supported was item 60 in the State List in Schedule VII of the Constitution reading: 'Taxes on profession, trades, callings and employments.' Being a 'pensioner' cannot be a 'profession, trade, business or calling', nor could a tax on a person because he is in receipt of a pension be said to be a tax on 'employments'. The tax therefore under the last portion of section 111(1)(b) reading Profession tax on persons 'in receipt of any pension or income from investments' is nothing but a tax on income falling within Entry 82 of the Union List. If, therefore, the Corporation could not justify the tax as being within the State legislative power the only manner in which it could be done would be by reference to article 277 of the Constitution by which 'taxes, duties, etc.' which 'were being lawfully levied' prior to the commencement of the Constitution were permitted to be levied 'notwithstanding that the tax was in the Union List' and 'to be applied to the same purposes' as before. Unless therefore the Corporation could make out that the tax now impugned was being lawfully levied from before the Constitution the levy would be illegal and besides there was the complication introduced by the enhancement of the rates of tax which, as stated earlier, were effected in April, 1950, April 1958 and in 1961. Leaving aside for the moment the question of the effect of the enhancement of the rate, we have to see whether it has been established that the duty was lawfully levied by the Corporation prior to the Constitution. The answer to the question whether it was 'lawfully levied' prior to 26th January, 1950 when the Constitution came into force would depend upon the effect of certain provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935. Under that enactment, as under the Constitution, the State legislative power as regards taxes of the nature now in controversy was couched in terms identical with that employed in entry 60 of the State List in the Constitution. Entry 46 in the Provincial Legislative List under the Government of India Act, 1935 ran: 'Taxes on profession, trades, callings and employments' : and 'taxes on income' fell within the exclusive Federal Legislative power under Entry 54 of List I. By the Indo-Burma Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1940 the Parliament of the U.K. enacted section 142 A to whose terms we shall advert later and by the same enactment entry 46 was amended and the words: 'Subject, however, to the provisions of section 142 A' were added at the end of entry 46. Here, again, it would be seen that if the right of the Corporation to levy profession tax on the pension received by a pensioner had to rest on the legislative entries it would fail because it was outside the legislative power of the Province under the Lists read with section 100 of that Act corresponding to article 246 of the Constitution. The validity of the levy during the period when the Government of India Act was in force i.e. between 1st April, 1937 and 25th January, 1950 was dependent on its falling within the saving contained in section 143(2) of the Government of India Act which ran: 'Any taxes, duties, cesses or fees which, immediately before the commencement of Part III of this Act, were being lawfully levied by any Provincial Government, municipality or other local authority or body for the purposes of the Province, municipality, district or other local area under a law in force on the first day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty five, may, notwithstanding that those taxes, duties, cesses or fees are mentioned in the Federal Legislative List, continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by the Federal Legislature.' No doubt the Amending Act was not in force on 1st January, 1935 having been passed in April 1936, but this would not take it out of section 143(2) because para.3 of the Indo-Burma (Transitory Provisions) Order, 1937, being an Order in Council by His Majesty in Council authorised by section 310 of the Government of India Act, provided: 'Para 3(1): For a period of two years from the commencement of Part III of the Indian Act, the provisions of subsection (2) of section one hundred and forty three of that Act (which authorises the continuance until provision to the contrary is made by the Federal Legislature, of certain provincial taxes falling within the Federal List) shall have effect as if the reference to the first of January nineteen hundred and thirty five were a reference to the commencement of the said Part III.' It would follow, therefore, that for the present demand to be sustained as valid it would be sufficient if it was shown that the tax was lawfully levied immediately prior to the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act, 1935, i.e., on 31st March, 1937. The learned Judges of the High Court held that this condition was satisfied and on this basis they have dismissed the appellant's petition. Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted four points in support of the appeal: (1) That the amending Act X of 1936 was not validly passed by reason of its contravening the Devolution Rules framed under section 45 A of the Government of India Act, 1919 by which Local Governments were given legislative power inter alia to levy taxes on professions, trades, etc. but that the present tax which is really a 'tax on income' was a Central subject outside the competence of the Local Legislature, (2) Even assuming that Act X of 1936 was valid, the tax which was permitted to be levied under it was, having regard to the terms of section 111(1) a new tax which was levied for the first time by the resolution of the Corporation only on and from April 1, 1937 and, therefore, the present tax was not in operation prior to the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act, 1935 and not therefore saved by section 143(2) of that Act, (3) Besides, between 1st April, 1937 to 1st April, 1942 it was not lawfully levied by reason of the lacuna created by the words of the rules in Schedule IV being inapplicable to the levy of a tax on pensioners, (4) The increase in the rates from 1937 onwards could not be justified even under section 143(2) or article 277 and by reason of these changes in rates the tax became virtually a new tax and could not continue to be lawfully levied to any extent after the increases. The first point need not detain us long. Prima facie it would seem that there being no rigid distribution of legislative power between the Central and Local Governments under the Government of India Act, 1919 any infraction of the rules made under the Devolution Rules framed under section 45 A would be validated by section 80 A(3) and section 84(2) of the Government of India Act, 1919. The learned Judges of the High Court before whom this contention was urged rejected it, and the learned counsel submitted that the decision on this point was not correct. But in the view that we took of the other submissions made to us, we did not hear learned counsel fully on this point and therefore do not propose to express any final opinion on the tenability of the argument on this head. As preliminary to the consideration of the second point it would be necessary to advert to one feature of the change effected by the Amending Act of 1936 to the tax levy. Under section 111, as it originally stood, the liability to pay the tax, i.e., the charge for the tax, was imposed by virtue of the statute itself, on persons who for the period prescribed 'exercised a profession or trade or calling or held an appointment', persons in receipt of pensions being deemed to be persons holding appointments. This structure as regards the imposition of liability was altered by the Amending Act. Under the provision, as recast, before a liability to pay the tax could arise the Council had to determine by a resolution that profession tax shall be levied and it was only that resolution which brought the charge into operation. Thus, the resolution of the Council was substituted for the statute itself as the mode by which the charge was to be imposed. There was also a second change that was introduced by rendering residence for six months within the city, besides the receipt of pension in the city, a necessary ingredient of the chargeability of the 'profession tax' on pensioners. The effect of these two changes now calls for consideration. On the amendment of section III by the Act of 1936 coming into force in April 1936, the statutory imposition of the charge to tax laid on persons in receipt of pensions within the city of Madras ceased, and the liability to tax as regards the period after that date was dependent on the passing of a resolution by the Council in terms of the amended section III(1) of the Act. In this connection it has to be pointed out that though recourse to the procedure as respects previous publication etc. prescribed by section 98 A was necessary only in the case of taxes newly levied, and might have been adopted in the present case because of the enhancement of the rates, still, a resolution of the Council was necessary to impose the tax as without it, no liability to profession tax would arise. The charge to tax was imposed, as stated earlier by the resolution of the Council which was to have effect from April 1, 1937. In other words by reason of the repeal of the original section III, the statutory charge to tax on pensions ceased in April 1936. A charge was imposed again under the resolution of the Council effective from 1st April, 1937, so that between April 1936 to 31st March, 1937, no charge was imposed by virtue of any 'law'. Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that this is in effect a new levy a levy of a tax which was not legally in existence on 31st March, 1937, and if this levy could not be supported as being sanctioned by section 143(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, it is common ground that the lawfulness of the levy cannot be sustained. We consider this submission well founded. If the statutory charge to profession tax imposed on pensioners by the Act of 1919, was lifted by the Act of 1936, and the tax again came into operation only on 1st April, 1937, it would follow that there was no 'levy of the tax' 'immediately before' the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act, 1935, so as to bring it within the saving in section 143(2) of that Act. Besides, the two circumstances viz.: that residence within the city for a specified period was made a condition of the liability to the tax, as well as the increase in the rates would both serve to emphasise that the levy was a new one, with a different texture and not a continuance of the tax which was levied just prior to the 1st April, 1937. Learned Counsel for the respondents the Corporation of Madras and the State have urged that it was in substance the old levy. We are unable to agree. The mere fact that prior to 1st April, 1937 the Corporation had under Act X of 1936 the power to bring the tax into force by a resolution does not on a proper construction of section 143(2) bring it within the range of those taxes or duties which 'were being lawfully levied' prior to the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act which alone are permitted to be continued to be levied notwithstanding that these duties were in the Federal Legislative List. This question has been considered by us in great detail in The Town Municipal Committee, Amravati vs Ram Chandra Vasudeo Chimote and Another, etc. in which judgment has been pronounced today and it is unnecessary to re-examine the same. The mere existence of a power to bring a tax into operation, cannot, as pointed out, be equated with 'a tax which was being lawfully levied' before Part III of the Government of India Act, 1935. The 3rd submission of learned Counsel for the appellant is also well founded. The conclusion we have reached as to the effect of the amendment to section 111 by Act X of 1936, and of the tax being imposed by resolution of the Council from 1st April, 1937 not being a tax which was being lawfully levied immediately prior to 1st April, 1942, is reinforced by reference to the rules in Schedule IV which remained unamended till 1942. Under section 111(1) as amended, the tax could be levied only in accordance with the rules in Schedule IV and as those rules did not make a provision for the levy of a tax on pensioners, it would follow that the tax 'was not being lawfully levied' on them. As already pointed out, the relevant rules in that Schedule were framed at a time when Explanation 2 formed part of section III and 'pensioners' were deemed to 'hold appointments'. With the deletion of the Explanation, the fiction created by the original Madras Act IV of 1919 ceased and thereafter if the rules in Schedule IV had to be applied to them these had to be suitably modified. This, as we have pointed out earlier, was done only from April 1, 1942, so that in reality taxes on pensioners were 'lawfully' levied up to 1936 and then after a break from April 1, 1942, we use the word 'lawfully' on the assumption that this could have been legally done under the Government of India Act, 1935, a point already discussed. The learned Judges of the High Court have rejected the argument addressed to them under this head by reference to section 18 of the Madras General Clause Act corresponding to section 24 of the General Clauses Act (Central Act X of 1897). With great respect to the learned Judges we do not see how this provision affords any assistance in the matter. The Schedule and the rules continued without repeal or amendment when the new section III(1) was substituted in 1936, and when this section made a reference to the rules in Schedule IV it could only be a reference to the rules in the Schedule IV which stood unaltered. If the phraseology employed in the Schedule was inappropriate to a class which fell within section 111(1), the only effect would be that the tax could not be levied, because of the defect in the law imposing the tax, but such a situation is not remedied by reference to the provision in the General Clauses Act on which the learned Judges have relied. If, therefore, the tax was one not lawfully levied just prior to April 1, 1937 and was one brought in after the Government of India Act, 1935 came into force, and really only from April 1, 1942 assuming this to be lawful it is obvious that the validity of this tax could not be sustained as a continuation of a lawful pre-existing levy under section 143(2). In this view it is not necessary to consider the last of the points urged by learned Counsel and examine whether in case of an increase of rate, the entire tax would become a new tax and so unconstitutional or whether it is only the increase in the rate that would become unenforceable. Learned Counsel for the respondent Corporation submitted that the tax could not be deemed to be a tax on income, as was suggested by the appellant, but was really a tax on employment because it was in consideration of past services during employment that pension was payable. This argument was admittedly not urged before the learned Judges of the High Court and is obviously untenable. The taxes specified in item 60 are taxes on the carrying on of a profession, trade, etc. and would, therefore, apply only to a case of present employment. The mere fact that a person has previously been in a profession or carried on a trade, etc. cannot justify a tax under this Entry. The tax on the receipt of pension or on the income from investments which is referred to in the last part of section 111(1) is in truth and substance a tax on income and in fact the argument before the High Court proceeded on this basis, so have the learned Judges. At the time the tax is levied the pensioner is in no employment but is only in receipt of income though it might be for past services, in an employment. He next submitted that Act X of 1936 which had been enacted prior to the Government of India Act, 1935 was continued as an existing law by section 292 of the Government of India Act and as there was nothing in the Government of India Act against its continuance it would have effect even if the terms of section 143(2) were not satisfied by the present levy. The learned Judges of the High Court accepted this submission. In our opinion, they were in error. The question of the correlation between article 372 corresponding to section 292 of the Government of India Act and article 277 corresponding to section 143(2) of the Government of India Act was considered by this Court in South India Corporation (P) Ltd. vs The Secretary, Board of Revenue, Trivandrum and this Court said: 'It is settled law that a special provision should be given effect to the extent of its scope, leaving the general provision to control cases where the special provision does not apply. The earlier discussion makes it abundantly clear that the Constitution gives a separate treatment to the subject of finances, and article 277 saves the existing taxes etc. levied by States, if the conditions mentioned therein are complied with. While article 372 saves all pre-Constitution valid laws, article 277 is confined only to taxes, duties, cesses or fees lawfully levied immediately before the Constitution. Therefore, article 372 cannot be construed in such a way as to enlarge the scope of the saving of taxes, duties, cesses or fees. To state it differently, article 372 must be read subject to article 277.' Learned Counsel next drew our attention to section 142 A(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935 and faintly suggested that it might afford him some assistance. This provision, again, was not adverted to before the learned Judges of the High Court and for a proper reason. section 142 A(1) which corresponds to article 276(1) of the Constitution enacted: 'Notwithstanding anything in section one hundred of this Act, no Provincial law relating to taxes for the benefit of a Province or of a municipality, district board, local board or other local authority therein in respect of professions, trades, callings or employments shall be invalid on the ground that it relates to a tax on income.' This section would assist the respondent only if tax imposed were one on a profession, trade, calling, or employment and in that event the section provides that such a tax shall not be deemed to be a tax on income, but where the tax imposed is one not on a profession, etc. at all, it does not mean that the State might levy a tax on income and call it 'profession tax'. This is sufficient to dispose of a similar argument as regards the scope of the amended Entry 46 in the Provincial Legislature List (List II) to which we have adverted earlier. The appeal accordingly succeeds and the appellant is held entitled to the relief prayed by him in the filed in the High Court, viz., a writ of Prohibition against the respondent Corporation from enforcing the demand. The appellant will be entitled to his costs from the respondents here and in the High Court. Appeal allowed.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 54 of 1969. From the Judgment and Order dated 23 10 1968 of the Mysore High Court in R.F.A. No. 25/63. B. D. Dal, section Bhandare, A. N. Karkhanis and Miss M. Palival for the Appellant. V. section Desai and N. Nettar for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA, J. This appeal by the defendant, on certificate, is directed against a judgment, dated October 23, 1968, whereby in First Appeal, the High Court of Mysore set aside the judgment and decree passed by the joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Belgaum. The pedigree of the family given below will be helpful in understanding the facts leading to this appeal: Ravalojirao (died before 1900) | | | Narayanarao Ramachandrarao (died in 1924) (died on 20 1 1955) | | Tuljeramarao Krishnabai (died in 1944) (Defendant appellant) | | | | Appasaheb Nanasaheb (Pltf.1.) (Pltf.2.) Sou. Vasundhararaje (Pltf. 3.) | | | | | | | Ashok Kumar Pushpendra Virendra Indrajit Ravalogirao | (Pltf.3) Singh Singh Singh (Pltf.9) | (pltf.6) (pltf.7) (pltf.9) Narayanarao (Pltf.10) By a registered document, dated July 25, 1902 (exhibit 39), executed by Narayanarao, six Desgat lands situated in villages Nanandi, Umarani and Nandikurli totalling about 120 acres, were received by Ramachandrarao, for separate living and maintenance of himself and his male lineal descendants. Out of the lands covered by the said deed, three lands comprised in Survey Nos. 114 (26 acres 30 gunthas), 115 (9 acres 38 gunthas) and 116 (26 acres 34 gunthas), totalling about 63 acres and 22 gunthas, situate in the area of village Umarani, Taluka Chikodi, are the subject matter of the suit, out of which this appeal has arisen. The respondents herein, who are the grand sons and great grandsons of Narayanarao, on July 24, 1960, instituted Suit No. 26/60 in the Court of Civil Judge, Belgaum against Smt. Krishnabai, appellant, for possession of the said lands and for recovery of past and future mesne profits, with these allegations: (i) that the suit lands were Desgat Watan lands and were part of the Desgat Watan estate of Nanandi, (ii) that by virtue of an ancient and immemorial family and territorial custom, the Desgat estate of Nanandi was impartible and descended from generation to generation to the seniormost member by the rule of primogeniture, while the junior members of the family were only given some lands for their maintenance by the holder of the Desgat for the time being; (iii) that till his death, the appellant 's father continued to be an undivided member of the Joint family consisting of himself and the plaintiffs; and (iv) that on July 31, 1956, a partition by metes and bounds has taken place between the plaintiffs inter se under a partition deed. The suit was resisted by the defendant appellant. She denied the alleged ancient, family and territorial custom of primogeniture. She denied that the property formed part of the Desgat Watan estate of Nanandi. She further denied that her father, Ramachandrarao, came into possession of the suit land for his maintenance. She further pleaded that Ramachandrarao and his brother Narayanarao had separated during their life time and the suit lands and some other lands were given to Ramachandrarao in the partition between the two brothers towards a part of his share, and it was agreed that the share of Ramchandrarao in other family properties would be separated and settled at some future convenient time. She further stated that since 1902, Ramachandrarao was in separate possession and enjoyment of the suit lands till his death on January 20, 1955, and that at the time of his death he was not an undivided member of the joint family of himself and the plaintiffs. She further pleaded that on her father 's death she succeeded to the suit lands, which were his separate property. She further relied on the Bombay Pargana and Kulkarni Wantans (Abolition) Act, 1950 (Bombay Act No. 60 of 1950), (for short, called the Act), and the re grant of the land made in favour of her father, under that Act. The learned trial judge by his judgment, dated September 29, 1962, dismissed the respondents ' suit with these findings: (a) that the alleged custom of impartibility and devolution of property by the rule of primogeniture had not been proved; (b) that there was a severance of the joint family consisting of the two brothers, in 1902, when they had agreed to separate, that since then for about 53 years till his death in 1955, Ramachandrarao was living separately and enjoying the suit land as his separate property; (c) that the suit lands were originally Watan lands, but they were not so at the date of the suit because the Bombay Act 60 of 1950, which came into force on May 1, 1951, had abolished Watans and thereafter the suit lands were, on the application of its holder, Ramachandrarao, regranted in his favour; that the plaintiffs were aware of Ramachandrarao 's application for the regrant and they had tacitly assented to the regrant in his favour. Aggrieved, the plaintiffs preferred an appeal in the High Court of Mysore. The High Court affirmed the finding of the trial court, that the custom pleaded by the plaintiffs with regard to the impartibility of the property had not been established. It observed that 'the onus of proving partition is on the defendant, 'but the only evidence in support of her case that Ramachandrarao was divided, is Exhibit No. 39'. The High Court construed the deed (exhibit 39) with the aid of its translations into English, one made by the trial judge and the other by the High Court Translator. It then took note of these features in support of the 'theory of partition ': '(a) Permanency of the arrangement. The deed provides that Ramachandrarao and his descendants in the male line shall enjoy the property from generation to generation without interference from the grantor. (b) Cesser of commonsality. The deed says that Ramachandrarao desired to live separately and therefore the lands were granted to him. The evidence is that Ramachandrarao lived separate from 1902. There is no evidence to the contrary. ' It then listed these features to negative the 'theory of partition ': '(a) The nomenclature of the deed. It is styled as a deed of maintenance. (b) It was executed by one of the parties only. If it was intended to be a partition deed it would have been executed by both the parties each relinquishing his rights in the properties not allotted to him. (c) The deed says that the lands were given to the grantee and his descendants in the male line for maintenance only and they should enjoy the lands continuously. (d) The total extent of the Desgat lands was over eight thousand acres; if partition was intended, Ramachandrarao who was entitled to a one half share would not have been contented with 90 acres valued at Rs. 3,400/ . ' After cataloguing these pros and cons the High Court concluded: 'In our judgment, Exhibit 39 considered along with the circumstances in which it was executed, does not establish the defendant 's case that Ramachandrarao was divided from Narayanarao in 1902 and that the suit lands, among others, were allotted to Ramachandrarao 's share. We are of the view that on the erroneous but honest belief that Desgat was an impartible estate, Narayanarao granted the lands to Ramachandrarao and his descendants in the male line in lieu of their maintenance. When Ramachandrarao died without male issue, the interest granted ceased or the tenure came to an end. The plaintiffs who are the surviving members of the family are entitled to resume the lands. ' Although no such plea was taken by the plaintiffs in the plaint, the High Court held that in view of Section 90 of the Indian Trust Act, the regrant made, after the abolition of Watans, under the Act in favour of Ramachandrarao must ensure for the benefit of the family of the Watandars including the plaintiffs, because Ramachandrarao at the time of his death was holding the suit land as an undivided member of the joint family, for his own benefit and that of the other members of the undivided family. Since there was no evidence as to the occupancy price paid by Ramachandrarao to obtain the regrant, the High Court, after allowing the appeal and setting aside the decree of the Trial Court, remanded the matter to the court below, with a direction that it should ascertain the amount of occupancy price paid by Ramachandrarao, and then pass a decree for possession in favour of the plaintiffs subject to the repayment of the said amount. Hence this appeal by the defendant on the basis of a certificate granted by the High Court under Article 133(1)(e) and (c) of the Constitution. Shri B. A. Bal, learned counsel for the appellant, has, in the course of his arguments, sought to make out two main points: 1. (a) Sometime prior to the execution of the deed. (exhibit 39) dated July 25, 1902, there was a severance of the joint Hindu family as a result of an intimation by Ramachandrarao of his intention to separate and Narayanarao 's acceptance of the same. Such severance can he clearly inferred from: (i) the recitals in the deed (exhibit 39), the permanent allocation of the suit land along with some other land, to Ramachandrarao and his descendants, and (ii) the subsequent conduct of the members of the erstwhile joint family. (b) Since the deed (exhibit 39) (it is argued) is more than 75 years old and Narayanarao, Ramachandrarao and others who might have given evidence with regard to the circumstances resulting in this transaction are all deed and gone, the recitals, in the deed coupled with the subsequent conduct of the parties, and supplemented by reasonable inferences, were more than sufficient to discharge the initial onus, if any, on the defendant to show severance of the joint family since 1902 or thereabout and the same continued till Ramachandrarao 's death in 1955. Reference in this connection has been made to Bhagwan Dayal vs Mst. Reoti Devi.(1) (c) Since at the time of his death in 1955, Ramachandrarao was not a member of an undivided Hindu family and the suit land was his separate property, his daughter the defendant would, even according to traditional Hindu Law, inherit his estate to the exclusion of the plaintiff collaterals. (2) Section 4 of the Bombay act 60 of 1950 abolished Watons with effect from May 1, 1951. Section 5 of the same Act abrogated the rule of primogeniture and also every law or custom by virtue of which females were postponed to males in the matter of succession. After the abolition of the Watons Ramachandrarao alone, to the knowledge of the plaintiff respondents, obtained a regrant of the suit land from the Government in his favour. Similarly, the plaintiffs applied for regrant of the other Ex watan lands measuring about 8000 acres, to the exclusion of Ramachandrarao. The regrant of the suit land in favour of Ramachandrarao created new rights exclusively in his favour. Since on May 1, 1951 he was holding the suit land separately as a divided member of the family, the regrant did not ensure for benefit of the plaintiffs. As against this, Shri V. section Desai submits that since it was the admitted case of the parties that sometime before the execution of the deed (exhibit 39) dated July 25, 1902. Narayanarao and Ramachandrarao constituted a joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshra, and the presumption of jointness in case of brothers is stronger, the burden was on the defendant to prove by cogent and convincing evidence that the joint family had disrupted and Ramachandrarao had separated in 1902 and the suit land was his separate property which fell to his share in partition. It is maintained that the recitals in the deed, exhibit 39, do not furnish any evidence that Ramachandrarao had communicated an unambiguous and clear intention to separate from his brother in estate and thenceforth hold it in defined shares. It is urged that the transaction evidenced by the deed should be construed by the Court, not according to its own sense of right and wrong, but according to the notions and beliefs prevailing among orthodox Hindus in 1902, of a strata of society to which Narayanarao and Ramachandrarao belonged. In 1902, proceeds the argument, to cause disruption of a joint Hindu family of Watandars was considered to be a sin. According to Shri Desai, if the document, exhibit 39, is considered from that view point it would appear that the arrangement devised thereby was consistent with the continuance and preservation of the jointness of the family and its estate, rather than its division and disruption. It is pointed out that the area of Watan Land held by the joint Hindu family in 1902 was about eight thousand acres, and if the intention of the brothers was to sever the joint family status, there was no difficulty in declaring that thenceforth the two brothers would hold the entire estate in equal, defined shares. It is emphasised, though Ramchandrarao, died in 1955, he never asked for partition and possession of his one half share in the remaining seven or eight thousand acres held by Narayanarao and his descendants, but remained contented with a mere 118 or 120 acres given to him for maintenance under exhibit 39 in 1902. It is further submitted that the Court cannot construe the deed exhibit 39, as a deed of partition, but only as a deed of maintenance, as it, expressly purports to be, because in view of Section 92 of the Evidence Act no extrinsic evidence is admissible to contradict or vary its terms. In support of his arguments Shri Desai has referred to Paragraph 448 of Mayne 's Hindu Law (1953 Edn.). Learned counsel further submits that in view of the paucity of evidence produced by the defendant appellant to show division of the joint family, the High Court was right in holding that Ramachandrarao died as an undivided member of the joint Hindu family consisting of himself and the plaintiffs. It is submitted, in that view of the matter, the second point urged by Shri Bal does not survive for decision. Nevertheless, Shri Desai took us through the relevant provisions of the Bombay Act LX of 1950 and the Watan Act of 1874, to show that there is nothing in those provisions which militates against the finding of the High Court to the effect, that if Ramachandrarao died as an undivided member of the joint family, the regrant would enure for the benefit of all the members of the family. We will take Point No. 1 canvassed by Shri Bal. The primary question that falls to be considered is, whether in 1902 or shortly prior to it, there was a partition between the two brothers Narayanarao and Ramachandrarao in a manner known to law. In this connection, it is necessary, at the outset, to notice the fundamental principles of Hindu Law bearing on the point. The parties are admittedly governed by Mitakshra School of Hindu Law. In an undivided Hindu family of Mitakshra concept, no member can say that he is the owner of one half, one third or one fourth share in the family property, there being unity of ownership and commonsality of enjoyment while the family remains undivided. Such unity and commonsality or the essential attributes of the concept of joint family status. Cesser of this unity and commonsality means cesser or severance of the joint family status, or, which under Hindu Law is 'partition ' irrespective of whether it is accompanied or followed by a division of the properties by metes and bounds. Disruption of joint status, itself, as Lord Westbury put it in Appovier vs Rama Subha Aivan. ,(1) in effect, 'covers both a division of right and division of property. ' Reiterating the same position, in Giria Bai vs Sadashiv,(2) the Judicial Committee explained that division of the joint status, or partition implies ' separation in interest and in right, although not immediately followed by a de facto actual division of the subject matter. This may, at any time, be claimed by virtue of the separate right. ' The division of the joint status may be brought about by any adult member of the joint family by intimating, indicating or representing to the other members in clear and unambiguous terms, his intention to separate and enjoy his share in the family property, in severality. Such intimation, indication or representation may take diverse forms. Sometimes it is evidenced by an explicit declaration (written or oral); sometimes, it is manifested by conduct of the members of the family in dealing separately with the former family properties. Service of notice or institution of a suit by one member/coparcener against the other members/coparceners for partition and separate possession may be sufficient to cause disruption of the joint status. We will now deal with the first proposition propounded by Shri Bal, in the light of these principles. The primary question that arises for consideration is, whether Ramchandrarao had brought about a division of the joint family status or partition by intimating to his brother in clear terms, sometime in 1902 or shortly prior thereto, his intention to separate and enjoy his share in severality. Answer to this question depends on inferences which may, reasonably be drawn from the contents of the deed (exhibit 39) and the subsequent conduct of the parties. The original deed, Ex.39 is in Marathi. It was rendered into English by the trial judge himself, who concededly had adequate knowledge of Marathi. According to him, the deed (Ex.39) speaks of a division of the joint family status and separation of interests. For this construction, the trial judge drew much on the word 'Vibhaktarahave ' which, according to him, connotes division of status. The learned Judges of the High Court however, did not accept this interpretation. They preferred to rely on the English translator of this deed made by the High Court Translator. Since there is some variation between the two translations, it will be worthwhile to extract the same here for facility of comparison and reference. The translation effected by the trial judge, reads as under: 'You (Ramchandra Rao) are my younger brother. We were living jointly till today. Recently you have desired to take some property for maintenance (Nirwah Kurat) and live separate after division (Vibhaktarahave). Since I have deemed it proper to give you some property for your maintenance as befits our Sansthan, I have given you the following properties for your maintenance. (Then follows the description of the properties). All these lands have been given to you along with the appurtenances for meeting the livelihood of you and your family members. Hence, you and your successors i.e., your natural born male descendants should enjoy the properties from generation to generation and live happily. The Sansthan will not interfere with the lands any longer. Only you and your natural male descendants should enjoy the property. You shall also pay the Joodi to the Government hereafter.' (The disputed words have now been underlined). The translation made by the High Court Translator reads as below: 'You are my younger brother and you have been residing with me only in jointness up till now. As you have been recently thinking of residing separately yourself by receiving some properties for your maintenance, I found it proper to give you some property for your maintenance as befits our Sansthan and have given you for your maintenance the 'Desgat ' lands of our Khata situate in the below mentioned villages in Taluka Chikodi Sub District, Belgaum District. Particulars thereof are as under: Lands situate at Village Nanadi. (1) Bagayat Land of No. bearing Survey No. 189 measuring 14 acres 23 guntas assessed at Rs. 20 0 0. The land together with a well valued at Rs. 1000/ . (2) The land measuring 9 acres 30 guntas assessed at Rs. 41 8 0 out of Survey No. 187 is bounded on the east by a land in our possession out of the same No. on the west by the village limits, on the south by the land No. 196 and on the north by the land bearing Survey No. 198. In the land enclosed within the aforesaid boundary there is a well. This well has two 'Veravantas ' i.e. one on the Eastern side and another on the Southern side. It has 10 'motes '. Out of the 'motes ' of that well we are to get water with 3 'motes ' and you are to get water with 2 'motes '. Repairs to the said well also are to be carried in that portion only and the expenses required to remove the mud etc., are also to be borne in the same proportion itself. Value Rs. 1000/ Lands situate at the Village Umarani. Rs. No. Acres Assessment 3 99 26 30 14 0 0 The said 3 4 100 9 38 9 0 0 lands are 5 101 26 34 17 0 0 entire No. and are valueed at Rs. 1000/ together with the appurte nant thereof. Land situate at Majere Kenpatte in the Village Nandikurli. 6 120 24 18 9 0 0 This land of entire No. together with the appurtenances thereof is valued at Rs.400/ . The lands as mentioned above are given to you for your maintenance and the maintenance of your dependants. Hence, you and your descendants, i.e., natural male descendants should enjoy the said lands continuously and live happily. In respect of the said lands given to you, you will not be put to any trouble from the state (Sansthan) in any manner but, the said lands are to be continued with you and your natural male descendants. You should go on paying the joodi payable by you to the Government in respect of the said lands in our possession are given to your possession today. To the above effect the deed of maintenance is duly executed. ' A comparative study of the above extracts would show that except for the English rendering of the word 'Vibhaktarahave ' by the learned trial judge, there is no substantial difference between the two translations. The Marathi word 'Vibhaktarahave ', according to my learned Brother on this Bench, who has working knowledge of Marathi, is a compound of two words, namely, 'Vibhakta ' and 'Rahave '. 'Vibhakta ' appears to have its root in the Sanskrit word 'Vibhaga '. 'In the Mitakshra, Vijnanesvara defines the word 'Vibhaga ' which is usually rendered into English by the word 'partition ' as the adjustment of diverse rights regarding the whole, by distributing them in particular portions of the aggregate.' (See Para 448 of Mayne 's Hindu Law, 11th Edition.) 'Rahave ' means 'living '. In view of this etymological analysis, it cannot be said that the learned trial judge 's interpretation of the word 'Vibhaktarahave ' as equivalent to 'live separately after division ' was literally wrong. Even the learned Judges of the High Court (who did not claim to know Marathi), have not held in categoric terms that this translation of 'Vibhaktarahave ' made by the trial judge is grammatically wrong. What the learned Judges appear to say is that the context in which the word 'Vibhaktarahave ' has been used, gives it a meaning different from its grammatical sense, so that it cannot be understood as signifying an intention to divide, but connotes only a desire to live separately. The learned Judges have sorted out four features from the context of the deed, exhibit 39, which, according to them, militate against the literal interpretation of the word 'Vibhaktarahave ' and negative the theory of division of status. Those features it will bear repetition are: (i) The deed is styled as one for maintenance, (ii) It was executed by Narayanarao only, (iii) The lands under the deed were given to Ramchandrarao and his descendants in the male line for maintenance only, (iv) The total extent of 'Desgat ' lands was over 8000 acres. Ramchandrarao should have claimed half of the entire 'Desgat ' area and not remained contented with about 90 acres given to him under the deed exhibit 39). In our opinion, none of these features, if appreciated in the right perspective, detracts from the conclusion that there was a division of joint family status as a result of an intimation to Narayanarao by Ramchandrarao, of his intention to separate, followed by allotment to Ramchandrarao in furtherance of that division, the lands mentioned in exhibit 39. The four features listed above rested on erroneous assumptions. Even according to the High Court, both the brothers were, at the time of execution of the document exhibit 39, labouring under an erroneous belief that the 'Desgat ' lands were impartible and held by the eldest member of the family in the male line, while the junior members were entitled only to maintenance. The High Court has expressly upheld the finding of the trial Court that no custom was established according to which, the 'Desgat ' lands of the family were impartible and vested only in the eldest male member of the family. The High Court has further not disagreed with the trial courts finding that no custom of primogeniture in this family has been established. Once it is held that this two fold assumption or belief about the impartibility of the estate and its devolution in the male line by rule of primogeniture was fallacious, the said four features stemming therefrom, lose their significance. These features which purport to give the transaction (exhibit 39) the colour of a mere maintenance arrangement as distinguished from an absolute transfer or allotment, have to be credited with no more substance than phantoms conjured out of phantasy, probably by the sole executant of the deed with a self serving motive. In any case, they are words of vain show or form lacking reality. We have therefore, to peal aside this jejune and illusory cover, to reach at the kernel and concentrate on the crucial features of the document exhibit 39. We are unable to accept Shri Desai 's argument that the process adopted by us would involve contravention of Section 92 of the Evidence Act. Firstly, in this process, which is essentially one of construction of the deed, exhibit 39, no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or subtracting any term of the disposition is involved. The deed, exhibit 39, falls into two distinct parts: The first of them comprises the preamble or the preliminary recital of a past fact. This part does not contain any term of disposition of property. Such terms are confined only to the second part. Section 92 prohibits only the varying of terms of the documents, not the memoranda or recitals of facts, bereft of dispositive terms, particularly when the correctness of the whole or any part of the recital is in question. We are primarily concerned with this preliminary recital which does not fall under the dispositive or operative portion of the document. The question is, whether or not this recital of a past oral intimation by Ramchandrarao to Narayanarao had caused severance of joint family status. It is settled law that a clear intimation by a coparcener to the other coparcener of his intention to sever the joint status need not be in writing. For these two fold reasons, the bar in section 92 against the admissibility of extrinsic evidence for the purpose of showing that the insertion of the words 'for your maintenance ' in the recital is wrong, unreal, unmeaning and the coinage of the executant 's own brain, is not attracted. Secondly, there is ample authority for the proposition that when there is a dispute in regard to the true character of a writing evidence de hors the document can be led to show that the writing was not the real nature of the transaction, but was only an illusory, fictitious and colourable device which cloaked something else, and that the apparent state of affairs was not the real state of affairs. [See Chandi Prasad Singh vs Piari Bedi C.A. No. 75 of 1964, decided on 16 3 1966, and Bhagwan Dayal vs Mst. Reoti Devi (supra) ]. This preliminary recital in the deed, exhibit 39 (as translated by the learned trial judge), with due emphasis on the words 'recently ' and 'Vibhaktarahave ', coupled with the surrounding circumstances and natural probabilities of the case, definitely raises the inference that sometime in the recent past, prior to the date of the deed, exhibit 39, Ramachandrarao had clearly and persistently intimated to his coparcener, Narayanarao, his intention to sever the joint family status and to hold and enjoy his share of the joint family property in severalty. The immediate and inexorable consequence of this intimation was disruption or division of the joint status, which, in the eye of Hindu Law, amounted to 'partition '. From that date onwards, which preceded the date of the deed, exhibit 39 Narayanarao and Ramchandrarao ceased to be coparceners and held the former coparcenary property as tenants in common. Thus, at the time of execution of the deed exhibit 39, the joint family status did not exist; it had already been put an end to by Ramchandrarao 's intimation to Narayanarao, of his intention to divide and separate. If that be the true position, it was not open even to Ramchandrarao, much less to Narayanarao, to nullify the effect of the communication of the former 's intention which had resulted in severance of the joint status, by revoking or withdrawing that communication. Ramchandrarao could not get back to the old position by mere revocation of the intention. A coparcenary is purely a creature of Hindu Law; it cannot be created, or recreated after disruption, by the act of par ties, save in so far that by adoption a stranger may be introduced as a member thereof or in the case of reunion. [See paragraphs 214 and 325 of Mulla 's Hindu Law and this Court 's decision in Puttorangama vs Ranganna; Bhagwan Dayal vs Mst. Reoti Devi (supra).] There is hot evidence that after the severance of the joint family status, there was a reunion. As before the High Court, here also, an argument was raised that the preliminary recital in the deed, exhibit 39, being qualified, furnishes little or no evidence for a finding that Ramchandrarao had declared and intimated in clear and unambiguous terms his intention to sever the joint family status. We are unable to accept this argument. It has to be borne in mind that this document has been let in evidence more than 70 years after its execution. Narayanarao and Ramchandrarao and all others who might have given evidence with regard to the circumstances of this recital in particular, and the deed in general, are long deed and gone. There is no dearth of authority for the proposition that in such a situation, it is permissible to draw reasonable inferences to fill the gaps or details obliterated by time. [See Chintamanibhatia Vankat Reddy vs Rani of Wadhavan; Sree Sree Iswar Gopal Jien Thakur vs Pratapmal Bagaria. The preliminary recital in the deed, therefore, assumes importance. Read in the light of the surrounding circumstances and in the perspective that the 'Desgat ' land was partible coparcenary property of the two brothers, each of whom had an equal interest therein and an equal right to get his share divided and thereafter enjoy it in severalty, this recital establishes with a preponderance of probability, that sometime before the execution of the deed, exhibit 39, Ramachandrarao had communicated to his brother, in clear, unmistakable terms his intention not only to separate in residence and user and put an end to commonsality, but also to sever the unity of ownership and enjoy his share in severalty. The result was division of the joint status. Once it is found that the division of the joint status preceded the execution of the deed, exhibit 39, then the disposition made thereunder could only be a step towards the implementation of that division and in recognition of Ramchandrarao 's right to have his share, wholly or partly demarcated and specified for separate enjoyment as an absolute and exclusive owner thereof. While giving the land measuring 118 or 120 acres to Ramchandrarao in recognition of the latter 's equal right in the Desgat, Narayanarao had no power to impose the futile condition that the land was being given to Ramchandrarao and his male lineal descendants for maintenance. As already discussed, this insertion by the executant from an ulterior self serving motive was devoid of substance; it could not be attached any greater importance and realty than the phantasmic assumption, from which it was conjured up: a fortiori, when in the deed, exhibit 39, there is no stipulation that in the event of Ramchandrarao 's male line becoming extinct, the land would revert to the 'Desgat ', and Narayanarao or his descendants would have a right of re entry. We are in agreement with the trial court that the expressions 'Potgi ' (maintenance) or 'Nirwahkrit ' in the deed cannot be construed as conferring an estate with restricted rights of 'ownership ', limited to the lifetime of Ramchandrarao and his linear male descendants. The deed evidence a permanent transfer or allotment of about 118 or 120 acres of land to Ramchandrarao to be enjoyed from generation to generation to the entire exclusion of Narayanarao and his descendants. In terms, Narayanarao did not reserve any right of reversion in favour of himself and his branch in any circumstances. Irrigation rights also with regard to the land transferred or allotted under this deed, were divided. It was further provided that from the date of the deed, payment of Joodi to the Government in respect of this land, shall also be the exclusive liability of Ramchandrarao and his descendants. The inference that this land, measuring about 118 acres was given to Ramchandrarao in partial implementation of division of joint family status or partition, receives further confirmation from the following circumstances: (a) From the date of the deed, exhibit 39, till Ramchandrarao 's death in 1955, for a period of about 53 years, the lands disposed of by the deed, throughout remained in the full, exclusive and uninterrupted enjoyment of Ramchandrarao. The relevant entries in the revenue records during this period, also, stand exclusively in his name as owner in possession thereof. (b) After the abolition of Watans in 1951, Ramchandrarao alone applied for regrant of this land in his favour, under the Watan Abolition Act. The plaintiffs were at all material times, admittedly aware that Ramchandrarao had applied for the regrant of this land exclusively in his favour, but they never objected, and tacitly assented to the same. On the other hand, the plaintiffs applied and obtained regrant of the 'Desgat ' lands (other than those which were the subject of the deed, exhibit 39), in their favour to the exclusion of Ramchandrarao. In the light of the above discussion, we are of opinion (i) that there was partition or division of the joint family status sometime prior to the execution of deed, exhibit 39, and (ii) that the disposition of about 118 or 120 acres made under that deed was, in substance an absolute allotment of that land to Ramchandrarao, towards implementation of that division or partition in recognition of the latter 's right to have his share demarcated by metes and bounds to be enjoyed exclusively in severalty. Point No. 1 is thus found in favour of the appellant. In view of the above finding that the suit property was the separate, divided property of Ramchandrarao at the date of his death, and under the traditional Hindu Law, would go by succession to his daughter, the appellant herein, to the exclusion of the plaintiff collaterals, it is not necessary to decide Point No. 2 canvassed by the appellant. In the result, for all the reasons aforesaid, we allow this appeal and dismiss the plaintiffs suit with costs throughout. P.B.R. Appeal allowed.",

                "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 68 of 1977. Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 15th November, 1976 of the Gujarat High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 832 of 1976. R.H. Dhebar and B. V. Desai for the Appellant. R.N. Poddar for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 284 THAKKAR, J. To say at the beginning what we cannot help saying at the end: human goodness has limits human depravity has none. The need of the hour however, is not exasperation. The need of the hour is to mould and evolve the law so as to make it more sensitive and responsive to the demands of the time in order to resolve the basic problem: 'Whether, when, and to what extent corroboration to the testimony of a victim of rape is essential to establish the charge.' And the problem has special significance for the women in India, for, while they have often been idolized, adored, and even worshipped, for ages they have also been exploited and denied even handed justice Sixty crores anxious eyes of Indian women are therefore focussed on this problem. And to that problem we will presently address ourselves. The learned Sessions Judge Mehsana found the appellant, a Government servant employed in the Sachivalaya at Gandhinagar, guilty of serious charges of sexual misbehaviour with two young girls (aged about 10 or 12) and convicted the appellant for the offence of rape, outraging the modesty of women, and wrongful confinement. The appeal carried to the High Court substantially failed. The High Court affirmed the order of conviction under Sec. 342 of the Indian Penal Code for wrongfully confining the girls. The High Court also sustained the order of conviction under Sec. 354 of the Indian Penal Code for outraging the modesty of the two girls. With regard to the more serious charge of rape on one of the girls, the High Court came to the conclusion that what was established by evidence was an offence of attempt to commit rape and not of rape. Accordingly the conviction under Sec. 376 was altered into one under Sec. 376 read with Sec. 511 of the Indian Penal Code. The appellant has preferred the present appeal with special leave. The incident occurred on Sunday, September 7, 1975, at about 5.30 p.m. at the house of the appellant. The evidence of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 shows that they went to the house of the appellant in order to meet his daughter (belonging to their own age group of 10 or 12) who happened to be their friend. The appellant induced them to enter his house by creating an impression that she was at home, though, in fact she was not. Once they were inside, the appellant closed the door, undressed himself in the presence of both the girls, and exposed himself. He asked P.W. 2 to indulge in an indecent act. P.W. 2 started crying and fled from there. P.W. 1 however could not escape. She was pushed into a cot, and was made to undress. The appellant sexually assaulted her. P.W. 1 was in distress and was weeping as she went out. She however could not apprise her parents about what had transpired because both of them were out of Gandhinagar (they returned after 4 or 5 days). It appears that the parents of P.W. 1 as well as parents of P.W. 2 wanted to hush up the matter. Some unexpected developments however forced the issue. The residents of the locality somehow came to know about the incident. And an alert Woman Social Worker, P.W. 5 Kundanben, President of the Mahila Mandal in Sector 17, Gandhinagar, took up the cause. She felt indignant at the way in which the appellant had misbehaved with two girls of the age of his own daughter, who also happened to be friends of his daughter, taking advantage of their helplessness, when no one else was present. Having ascertained from P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 as to what had transpired, she felt that the appellant should atone for his infamous conduct. She therefore called on the appellant at his house. It appears that about 500 women of the locality had also gathered near the house of the appellant. Kundanben requested the appellant to apologize publicly in the presence of the woman who had assembled there. If the appellant had acceded to this request possibly the matter might have rested there and might not have come to the court. The appellant, however, made it a prestige issue and refused to apologize. Thereupon the police was contacted and a complaint was lodged by P.W. 1 on 19 Sept. 1975. P.W. 1 was then sent to the Medical officer for medical examination. The medical examination disclosed that there was evidence to show that an attempt to commit rape on her had been made a few days back. The Sessions Court as well as the High Court have accepted the evidence and concluded that the appellant was guilty of sexual misbehavior with P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 in the manner alleged by the prosecution and established by the evidence of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2. Their evidence has been considered to be worthy of acceptance lt is a pure finding of fact recorded by the Sessions Court and affirmed by the High Court. Such a concurrent finding of fact cannot be reopened in an appeal by special leave unless it is established: (1) that the finding is based on no evidence or (2) that the finding is perverse, it being such as no reasonable person could have arrived at even if the evidence was taken at its face value or (3) the finding is based and built on inadmissible evidence, which evidence, if excluded from vision, would negate the prosecution case or substantially discredit 286 or impair it or (4) some vital piece of evidence which would tilt the balance in favour of the convict has been overlooked, disregarded, or wrongly discarded. The present is not a case of such a nature. The finding of guilt recorded by the Sessions Court as affirmed by the High Court has been challenged mainly on the basis of minor discrepancies in the evidence. We do not consider it appropriate or permissible to enter upon a reappraisal or reappreciation of the evidence in the context of the minor discrepancies painstakingly highlighted by learned counsel for the appellant. Over much importance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies. The reasons are obvious: (1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen. (2) ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the details. (3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on one person’s mind whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of another. (4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can only recall the main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder. (5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it depends on the time sense of individuals which varies from person to person. 287 (6) Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated later on. (7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court atmosphere and the piercing cross examination made by counsel and out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events, or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The sub conscious mind of the witness sometimes so operates on account of the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witness is giving a truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him Perhaps it is a sort of a psychological defence mechanism activated on the spur of the moment. Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue importance. More so when the all important 'probabilities factor' echoes in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses. It is now time to tackle the pivotal issue as regards the need for insisting on corroboration to the testimony of the prosecutrix in sex offences. This Court, in Rameshwar vs The State of Rajasthan,(1) has declared that corroboration is not the sine que non for a conviction in a rape case. The utterance of the Court in Rameshwar may be replayed, across the time gap of three decades which have whistled past, in the inimitable voice of Vivian Bose, J. who spoke for the Court The rule, which according to the cases has hardened into one of law, is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a conviction but that the necessity of corroboration, as a matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it safe to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge . . 288 The only rule of law is that this rule of prudence must be present to the mind of the Judge or the jury as the case may be and be understood and appreciated by him or them. There is no rule of practice that there must, in every case, be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand.' And whilst the sands were running out in the time glass, the crime graph of offences against women in India has been scaling new peaks from day to day. That is why an elaborate rescanning of the jurisprudential sky through the lenses of 'logos' and 'ethos', has been necessitated. In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion? To do so is to justify the charge of male chauvinism in a male dominated society. We must analyze the argument in support of the need for corroboration and subject it to relentless and remorseless cross examination. And we must do so with a logical, and not an opiniated, eye in the light of probabilities with our feet firmly planted on the soil of India and with our eyes focussed on the Indian horizon. We must not be swept off the feet by the approach made in the Western World which has its own social mileu, its own social mores, its own permissive values, and its own code of life. Corroboration may be considered essential to establish a sexual offence in the backdrop of the social ecology of the Western World. It is wholly unnecessary to import the said concept on a turn key basis and to transplate it on the Indian soil regardless of the altogether different atmosphere, attitudes, mores, responses of the Indian Society and its profile. The identities of the two worlds are different. The solution of problems cannot therefore be identical. It is conceivable in the Western Society that a female may level false accusation as regards sexual molestation against a male for several reasons such as: (1) The female may be a 'gold digger' and may well have an economic motive to extract money by holding out the gun of prosecution or public exposure. 289 (2) She may be suffering from psychological neurosis and may seek an escape from the neurotic prison by phantasizing or imagining a situation where she is desired, wanted, and chased by males. (3) She may want to wreak vengence on the male for real or imaginary wrongs. She may have a grudge against a particular male, or males in general, and may have the design to square the account. (4) She may have been induced to do so in consideration of economic rewards, by a person interested in placing the accused in a compromising or embarassing position, on account of personal or political vendatta. (5) She may do so to gain notoriety or publicity or to appease her own ego or to satisfy her feeling of self importance in the context of her inferiority complex. (6) She may do so on account of jealousy. (7) She may do so to win sympathy of others. (8) She may do so upon being repulsed. By and large these factors are not relevant to India, and the Indian conditions. Without the fear of making too wide a statements or of overstating the case, it can be said that rarely will a girl or a woman in India make false allegations of sexual assault on account of any such factor as has been just enlisted. The statement is generally true in the context of the urban as also rural Society. It is also by and large true in the context of the sophisticated, not so sophisticated, and unsophisticated society. Only very rarely can one conceivably come across an exception or two and that too possibly from amongst the urban elites. Because: (1) A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non permissive Society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred. (2) She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracised by the Society or being looked down by the Society including by her own family members, relatives, friends and neighbours. (3) She would have to brave the 290 whole world. (4) She would face the risk of losing the love and respect of her own husband and near relatives, and of her matrimonial home and happiness being shattered. (5) If she is unmarried, she would apprehend that it would be difficult to secure an alliance with a suitable match from a respectable or an acceptable family. (6) It would almost inevitably and almost invariably result in mental torture and suffering to herself. (7) The fear of being taunted by others will always haunt her. (8) She would feel extremely embarrassed in relating the incident to others being over powered by a feeling of shame on account of the upbringing in a tradition bound society where by and large sex is taboo. (9) The natural inclination would be to avoid giving publicity to the incident lest the family name and family honour is brought into controversy. (10) The parents of an unmarried girl as also the husband and members of the husband’s family of a married woman would also more often than not, want to avoid publicity on account of the fear of social stigma on the family name and family honour. (11) The fear of the victim herself being considered to be promiscuous or in some way responsible for the incident regardless of her innocence. (12) The reluctance to face interrogation by the investigating agency, to face the court, to face the cross examination by Counsel for the culprit, and the risk of being disbelieved, acts as a deterrent. In view of these factors the victims and their relatives are not too keen to bring the culprit to books. And when in the face of these factors the crime is brought to light there is a built in assurance that the charge is genuine rather than fabricated. On principle the evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands on par with evidence of an injured witness. Just as a witness who has sustained an injury (which is not shown or believed to be self inflicted) is the best witness in the sense that he is least likely to exculpate the real offender, the evidence of a victim of a sex offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. And while corroboration in the form of eye witness account of an independent witness may often be forthcoming in physical assault cases, such evidence cannot be expected in sex offences, having regard to the very nature of the offence. It would therefore be adding insult to injury to insist on corroboration drawing inspiration from the rules devised by the courts in the Western World. Obseisance to which has perhaps become a habit presumably on account of the colonial hangover. We are therefore of the opinion that if the evidence of the victim does not suffer from any basic infirmity, and the probabilities factors does not render it unworthy of credence, as a general 291 rule, there is no reason to insist on corroboration except from the medical evidence, where, having regard to the circumstances of the case, medical evidence can be expected to be forthcoming, subject to the following qualification: Corroboration may be insisted upon when a woman having attained majority is found in a compromising position and there is a likelihood of her having levelled such an accusation on account of the instinct of self preservation. Or when the ‘probabilities factor’ is found to be out of tune. Now we return to the facts of the present case. Testing the evidence from this perspective, the evidence of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 inspires confidence. The only motive suggested by defence was that there was some history of past trade union rivalry between the father of P.W. 2 and the appellant. It must be realized that having regard to the prevailing mores of the Indian Society, it is inconceivable that a girl of 10 or 12 would invent on her own a false story of sexual molestation. Even at the age of 10 or 12 a girl in India can be trusted to be aware of the fact that the reputation of the entire family would be kindised, upon such a story being spread. She can be trusted to know that in the Indian Society her own future chances of getting married and settling down in a respectable or acceptable family would be greatly marred if any such story calling into question her chastity were to gain circulation in the Society. It is also unthinkable that the parents would tutor their minor daughter to invent such a story in order to wreak vengence on someone. They would not do so for the simple reason that it would bring down their own social status in the Society apart from ruining the future prospects of their own child. They would also be expected to be conscious of The traumatic effect on the psychology of the child and the disastrous consequences likely to ensue when she grows up. She herself would prefer to suffer the injury and the harassment, rather than to undergo the harrowing experience of lodging a complaint in regard to a charge reflecting on her own chastity. We therefore refuse to countenance the suggestion made by the defence that the appellant has been falsely roped in at the instance of the father of P.W. 2 who was supposed to have some enmity against the appellant. It is unthinkable that the parents of P.W. 2 would tutor her to invent a story of sexual misbehavior on the part of the appellant merely in order to implicate him on account of past trade union rivalry. The parents would have also realized the danger of traumatic effect on the psychology of their daughter. In fact it would have been considered to be extremely distasteful to 292 broach the subject. It is unthinkable that the parents would go to the length of inventing a story of sexual assault on their own daughter and tutor her to narrate such a version which would bring down their own social status and spoil their reputation in Society. Ordinarily no parents would do so in Indian society as at present. Under the circumstances the defence version that the father of P.W. 2 had tutored her to concoct a false version in order to falsely implicate the appellant must be unceremoniously thrown overboard. Besides, why should the parents of P.W. 1 mar the future prospects of their own daughter? It is not alleged that P.W. 1 had any motive to falsely implicate the appellant. So also it is not even suggested why P.W. 1 should falsely implicate the appellant. From the stand point of probabilities it is not possible to countenance the suggestion that a false story has been concocted in order to falsely implicate the appellant. The medical evidence provided by P.W 6, Dr. Hemangini Desai, fully supports the finding of the High Court that there was an attempt to commit rape on P.W. 1. Under the circumstances the conclusion reached by the High Court cannot be successfully assailed. The only question that now remains to be considered is as regards the sentence. The appellant has behaved in a shockingly indecent manner. The magnitude of his offence cannot be overemphasized in the context of the fact that he misused his position as a father of a girl friend of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2. P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 were visiting his house unhesitatingly because of the fact that his daughter was their friend. To have misused this position and to have tricked them into entering the house, and to have taken undue advantage of the situation by subjecting them to sexual harassment, is a crime of which a serious view must be taken. But for the following facts and circumstances, we would not have countenanced the prayer for leniency addressed to us on behalf of the appellant. The special circumstances are these. The appellant has lost his job in view of the conviction recorded by the High Court. The incident occurred some 7 years back. The appeal preferred to the High Court was dismissed in November 15, 1976. About 6 1/2 years have elapsed thereafter. In the view that we are taking the appellant will have to be sent back to jail after an interval of about 6 1/2 years. The appellant must have suffered great humiliation in the Society. The prospects of getting a suitable match for his own daughter have perhaps been marred in view of the stigma in the wake of the finding of guilt recorded against him in the context of such an offence. 293 Taking into account the cumulative effect of these circumstances, and an overall view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the ends of Justice will be satisfied if the substantive sentence imposed by the High Court for the offence under Sec. 376 read with Sec. 511 is reduced from one of 2 1/2 years’ R. I., to one of 15 months’ R.I. The sentence of fine, and in default of fine, will be course remain undisturbed. So also the sentence imposed in the context of the offence under Sec. 342 and Sec 354 of the Indian Penal Code will remain intact. Subject to the modification in the sentence to the aforesaid extent the appeal fails and is dismissed The appellant shall surrender in order to undergo the sentence. The bail bonds will stand cancelled. S.R. Appeal dismissed.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal Nos. 973 74 of 1985. From the Judgment and order dated 15.7.1983 of the Allahabad High Court in Writ Petition Nos. 3532 of 1979 & 357 of 1981. Dr. L.M. Singhvi, K.R. Nagaraja, R.S. Hegde and C. Mukhopadhyay for the Appellants. A.D. Singh, Mrs. section Dikshit, A.K. Gupta, Raju Ramachandaran and B.S. Chauhan for the Respondents. Subhash Chandra, Respondent No. 34 in person. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DUTT, J. These two appeals by special leave involve the interpretation of the Uttar Pradesh Non Technical (Class II) Services (Reservation of Vacancies for Demobilised officers) Rules, 1973, hereinafter referred to as 'the 1973 Rules ', and the Uttar Pradesh Non Technical (Class II/Group 'B ') Services (Appointment of Demobilised officers) Rules, 1980, hereinafter referred to as 'the 1980 Rules ', relating to the seniority of the appellants vis a vis the private respondents. 577 The appellants have all been appointed in the Provincial Civil Service of the State of Uttar Pradesh as direct recruits on the basis of competitive examinations held by the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission. The appointments of the appellants were made under the U.P. Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 1941 framed under section 241(1)(b) of the Government of India Act, 1935, hereinafter referred to as 'the Service Rules '. The respondents were recruited under the 1973 Rules and/or the 1980 Rules. The respondents were either Emergency Commissioned officers or the Short Service Commissioned officers of the armed forces of the Union of India and were commissioned on or before November 1, 1962 during the Indo Chinese war. They were demobilised from armed forces in or about 1968. These respondents, therefore, rendered services to the country during the operation of the emergency when the nation 's security was in peril due to external aggression. In order to rehabilitate such persons and to ensure them that in civil life, after the cessation of emergency, they were not to suffer for rendering services to the nation and with a view to putting the respondents at par with other persons, the 1973 Rules were framed by the Governor of U.P. in exercise of his powers under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. Rule 1(3) of the 1973 Rules provide that they shall remain in force for a period of five years from the date of their commencement. Rule 3, inter alia, provides for the reservation of ten per cent of the permanent vacancies in all Non Technical (Class II) Services to be filled substantively by direct recruitment through competitive examination in any year. Rule 6 relating to seniority and pay, which is important for the purpose of these appeals, is extracted below: 'R.6. Seniority and pay (1) Seniority and pay of candidates appointed against the vacancies reserved under sub rule (1) of rule 3, shall be determined on the assumption that they entered the service concerned at their second opportunity, of competing for recruitment, and they shall be assigned the same year of allotment as successful candidates of the relevant competitive examination: Provided that any such candidate who had two opportunities before the date of his joining the training 578 prior to his commission whether he actually availed any A such opportunity or not, shall be assigned the same year of allotment as successful candidates of the first competitive examination held after the said date. Explanation The year of a candidate 's second opportunity will be determined by the date of his birth in relation to the prescribed minimum age for competing for recruitment to the service. (2) Seniority inter se of candidates who are appointed against vacancies reserved under sub rule (1) of rule 3 and allotted to a particular year shall be determined according to the merit list prepared by the Ayog on the basis of the results of their performance at the examination. (3) All candidates appointed against vacancies reserved under sub rule (1) of rule 3 and allotted to any particular year shall rank below the candidates who were successful at the competitive examination held for recruitment to the service in that year. (4) The pay of candidates appointed against vacancies referred to in sub rule (3) of rule 3 shall also be determined in the same manner as indicated in sub rule (1) of this rule but their seniority shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing sub rules only if and at the point of time when they are appointed substantively against permanent vacancies.' For the purpose of seniority and pay, rule 6 takes into account the period of war service rendered by a candidate who, after his demobilisation from such service, successfully competes in the relevant examination which is in the present case, the Provincial Civil Service Examination. Under Rule 6, when such a candidate is recruited after his successfully competing in the relevant examination, it will be assumed that he had entered service with retrospective effect from the year in which he had the second opportunity of taking the relevant examination for his recruitment, which he could not take on account of his having joined the service of the armed forces of the Union of India. So far as the actual period rendered by the respondents in the 579 armed forces during the emergency is concerned, there is no dispute that such period shall be taken into consideration for the purpose of computing the seniority and pay. The grievance of the appellants is that although there were long gaps between the dates of demobilisation and the dates of recruitment of the respondents, the State of Uttar Pradesh had, in computing the seniority of the respondents, taken into consideration not only the period during which the respondents were in the services of the armed forces, but also such long gaps. It is pointed out by the appellants that in the cases of one or two respondents, the gaps were even of about 11 years and these long gaps had been taken into account in computing their seniority. As a result of such computation, the respondents after their appointments were placed above the appellants, although the appellants were recruited to the Provincial Civil Service under the Service Rules long before the respondents were recruited. If such gaps are excluded from consideration, the appellants will be seniors to the respondents. It is also alleged by the appellants that several of the respondents, after coming back from the army, joined various services, both Government and private services, and had spent 3 to 10 years or more in those services before they were recruited under the 1973 Rules or 1980 Rules. In 1976, a seniority list was prepared showing the respondents seniors to the appellants on the basis of the period of their service in the armed forces and the gaps between their discharge and recruitment. In 1980 also, a seniority list was prepared in like manner showing the appellants as juniors to the respondents. Being aggrieved by the 1976 seniority list, the appellants moved two writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court, inter alia, challenging the validity of the 1973 Rules and also 1980 Rules. The High Court overruled the contention of the appellants that the 1973 Rules and 1980 Rules were invalid being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and held that both these Rules were legal and valid. It, however, took the view that under rule 6 of the 1973 Rules or rule 5 of 1980 Rules, which are verbatim the same, the period during which the respondents had no employment or were employed elsewhere till recruitment in the Provincial Civil Service after competing in the relevant examination, will be taken into account along with the period during which they were in the services of the armed forces for the purpose of computing their seniority in the Provincial Civil Service. Accordingly, the High Court upheld the vali 580 dity of the impugned seniority list. Hence this appeal. It is urged by Dr. Singhvi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants, that the interpretation given by the High Court of rule 6 of the 1973 Rules relating to seniority and pay is in excess of the relief intended to be granted by that rule. It is submitted that rule 6 was framed for the purpose of taking into consideration the period of service in the armed forces in computing the seniority of a candidate appointed in the Provincial Civil Service after competing in the relevant examination, so that he does not suffer because of joining the armed forces. Rule 6 does not provide for taking into consideration the gap between the date of demobilisation of a candidate and the date on which he is appointed in the Provincial Civil Service after competing in the relevant examination. If such gaps are also taken into consideration, it would be doing injustice to the appellants who have been appointed long before the respondents. Accordingly, Dr. Singhvi submits that when a candidate who was in the armed forces of the Union joined the Provincial Civil Service after his discharge from the armed forces, it would be assumed that he had entered the Provincial Civil Service at the second opportunity of competing for the recruitment, but no other period including that between the discharge and recruitment will be taken into account for the purpose of computing the seniority of such a candidate. On the other hand, it is submitted by Mr. Anil Dev Singh and Mr. Gupta, learned Counsel for the respondents, and Mr. Subhash Chandra, respondent No. 34, appearing in person, that rule 6 does not prohibit, either expressly or by necessary implication, the taking into account of the period between demobilisation and recruitment in the Provincial Civil Service. It is submitted that not only the length of the war service but also such gaps should be considered for the purpose of computation of seniority. They submit that as only ten per cent of the vacancies were reserved for war service candidates, it was difficult for such candidates to get a chance within a reasonable time after their discharge from war service and it would be quite consistent with rules of natural justice to take into account the interregnum between the date of discharge and the date of recruitment. Rule 6 only provides that after the discharge of a candidate from the armed forces and his subsequent appointment in civil service on the basis of competitive examination, it will be assumed that he had joined the service at the second opportunity of competing for the recruitment. The second opportunity has been explained in the Expla 581 nation to rule 6. It provides that the year of a candidate 's second opportunity will be determined by the date of his birth in relation to the prescribed minimum age for competing for recruitment to the service. For example, if the minimum age for taking the competitive examination for recruitment is 21 years, the first opportunity of a candidate will be in the year he attains that age and the second opportunity will be in the next year, that is, at the age of 22 years. Under rule 6, the recruitment of a war service candidate will be assumed to have been made in the year in which he had the second opportunity of competing for such recruitment. In other words, the seniority of such a candidate will be computed on the basis that he had joined the civil service in the year of his second opportunity of competing for the recruitment. It is true that rule 6 does not provide for the period between demobilisation and recruitment of a war service candidate in the civil service. Nor does it forbid consideration of such period. It cannot, however, be deemed that after the discharge from war service, there will be some lapse of time for the recruitment of a candidate in the Provincial Civil Service. Immediately after discharge, one cannot get himself recruited in the Provincial Civil Service. There is a question of competing in the examination. Rule 6 does not provide for any gap to be taken into consideration, yet it is apparent that some reasonable period has to be allowed to a candidate so as to enable him to avail himself of the opportunity of appearing at the competitive examination for his recruitment in the Provincial Civil Service. It cannot be gainsaid that to compete in the examination, a candidate has to make preparation for that. Competitive examinations are generally difficult and, in our opinion, at least two years ' time should be allowed to a candidate, after his discharge, for his preparation for the competitive examination and that will be his first opportunity. The second opportunity will arise in the next year, that is, in the third year of his discharge from the armed forces. In other words, he should be allowed three years for competing in the relevant examination for recruitment in the civil service. Even after he becomes successful, he is not recruited immediately. There is the question of availability of vacancies and posting. It is common knowledge that some time is taken for posting. On a proper construction of rule 6, the period spent by a candidate for competing in the examination which, in our opinion, will not be more than three years, and the period of time taken for his recruitment or posting will also be taken into consideration for the purpose of computing the 582 seniority of a war service candidate. Thus, if a candidate is discharged in the year 1968, he should be given three years ' time to avail himself of the opportunity of competing in the examination. Suppose, he is successful in the examination held in 1971 and posted in 1973. In view of rule 6, he would be deemed to have entered service at the second opportunity of competing for recruitment and the entire period from the date of assumed entry in the service up to his recruitment in 1973 shall be taken into account for the purpose of computing seniority and pay. If, however, a candidate does not avail himself of the opportunity within three years of his discharge from war service or takes the examination but becomes unsuccessful, the period between his discharge and subsequent recruitment will not be taken into account for the purpose of computing the seniority. Rule 6 should be given a reasonable interpretation. We do not find any reason to interpret rule 6 in a way which will be doing injustice to the appellants who have been recruited under the Service rules after competing successfully in the examination. We agree with the High Court that the 1973 Rules as also the 1980 Rules are quite legal and valid. We are, however, of the view that under rule 6 of the 1973 Rules or rule 5 of the 1980 Rules only a reasonable period, namely, the period of three years, required for taking the examination and the time taken for recruitment or posting, as discussed above, along with the period of war service, but no other period, will be taken into consideration for the purpose of computing the seniority and pay. The impugned seniority list prepared in 1976 and also that prepared subsequently in the year 1980 cannot be sustained, as they have been prepared by taking into consideration the entire period between the discharge and the recruitment without any reservation for computing the seniority. For the reasons aforesaid, we set aside the judgment of the High Court relating to the interpretation of rule 6 of the 1973 Rules. The impugned seniority lists of 1976 and 1980 are also quashed. The State of Uttar Pradesh is directed to prepare the seniority list in the light of the observations made hereinabove within a period of six months from date. The appeals are allowed to the extent indicated above. There will, however, be no order as to costs in either of these appeals. G.N. Appeals allowed.",

            "judgement": "Criminal Appeal No. 202 of 1962. Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and Order dated August 1, 1962, of the Mysore High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 213 of 1961. W. section Barlingay and A. G. Ratnaparkhi, for the appellant. R. Gopalakrishnan and B. R. G. K. Achar, for the respondent. April 1, 1964. The Judgment of SUBBA RAO and DAS GUPTA JJ. was delivered by DAs GUPTA J. RAGHUBAR DAYAL J delivered a dissenting opinion. DAS GUPTA, J. The appellant, who was a registration clerk in the Haveri Post Office in the Mysore State, was tried by the Sessions Judge, Dharwar, on charges under section 52, section 53 and section 55 of the Indian Post Office Act. The prosecution case is that on the 18th October 1955 a registered letter containing half portion of a ten rupee note and petition on behalf of one Muppayyagonda asking for the said note to be exchanged for a fresh note was received at the Haveri Post Office at 4.30 p.m. from the Branch Post Office at Kabbur. The appellant who was a, registration clerk at Haveri at the time, however, detained the registered envelope instead of despatching it that very day as he should have done. He despatched it the next day. It was the prosecution case that the appellant removed the half portion of the ten rupee currency note from inside the envelope and to cover up his misconduct made alterations in the petition contained in the envelope and in the list of registered articles. All this was discovered, it is said, when the Reserve Bank of India, to which this envelope was addressed made enquiries in the matter on finding that no note had been enclosed with the petition. The appellant admitted that the envelope was received at the Haveri Post Office on October 18, 1955 and also, that he did not despatch it on that date. His case was that it was received at about 5.30 p.m. on the 18th and so it was too late for despatch on that date but that he despatched it duly on the 19th, On a consideration of the evidence the Sessions Judge held that the charge under section 52 of the Indian Post Office Act for the theft of currency note and for secreting the registered articles had not been established and acquitted him of that charge. He, however, found it proved that the appellant had fraudulently altered the lists of registered articles and thereby committed an offence under section 55 of the Indian Post Office Act. He also held that the appellant had wilfully detained the envelope and thus committed an offence under section 53 of the Indian Post Office Act. He accordingly convicted the appellant of the charges under Ss. 53 and 55 of the Indian Post Office Act and sentenced him to undergo two months' imprisonment on each charge. The sentences were directed to run concurrently. On appeal, the High Court of Mysore set aside the appellant's conviction under section 55 of the Indian Post Office Act but maintained his conviction under section 53, being of opinion that while the wilful detention of the envelope by the appellant had been proved, the alleged alterations by him in the list of registered articles had not been established. Against the High Court's decision the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant, Ramchandra Narasimha Kulkarni. In support of the appeal it is contended by Dr. Barlingey that as the allegations of theft of the note or of alterations in the list of registered articles by the appellant have not been established, the appellant must be held not to have committed any offence under section 53 of the Indian Post Office Act. It is argued that assuming that the envelope was detained by the appellant as alleged, he cannot be said to have detained it `wilfully' unless it is shown that he had some purpose in doing it. But, the purpose alleged by the prosecution was that he wanted to commit theft of the currency note, and to cover this up, to make alterations in the list of registered articles, these purposes have not been established. So, argues the learned Counsel, the detention of the envelope should be held to have been made without any purpose but only through inadvertence or mere carelessness. That would not constitute, according to the learned Counsel, a, wilful detention. The words 'wilful' and 'wilfully' are frequently used in many statutes and have come up for judicial consideration in the courts of this country as also elsewhere. The meaning given to these words have differed in different contexts. Sometimes, any intentional act has been held to be a wilful act. (Re Young and Harston)(1). Often, it has been said that the word wilful suggests bad conduct or action though it does not necessarily connote blame. (Wheeler vs New Merton Board Mills)(2) Not infrequently the word has been used to mean that the act had been done with a bad purpose or without justifiable excuse or stubbornly, obstinately or perversely. (United States of America vs Harry Murdock)(3). Some decisions stress the requirement of deliberation or reckless disregard of the fact whether the act was or was not in breach of duty in deciding whether it has been wilful. (Hudson vs Official Liquidator(4); and In re T.N.K. Govindarajulu Chetty)(5). In the last mentioned case, viz., In re T.N.K. Govindarajulu Chetty's case, the Madras High Court held that a submission of a false return cannot be a wilful submission unless the dealer has deliberately made the return with the knowledge that he was excluding a taxable item, though in almost similar circumstances another Bench of the same High Court took a different view and held that even though when an assessee, under the impression that a particular item is not taxable and, therefore, need be excluded in the return, omits to make a mention, of it in the return which he furnished with the full knowledge of his having committed the same, he has 'wilfully' omitted it. (In re Jayarama Chettiar) (6). A review of these various decisions brings out clearly the guiding principle that the meaning to be attached to the words 'wilful' or 'wilfully' has to be ascertained on a close examination of the scheme and nature of the legislation in which the words appear and the context in which they are used. Turning now, for this purpose, to the Indian Post Office Act, we notice that s.53 which makes punishable the wilful detention or delay of a postal article by an officer of the post office in one of the several sections which create offences under this Act. There are 21 such sections, being sections 49 to 56 and 58 to 70, all in Chapter X of the Act. Some of these offences, viz., those under Ss. 49, 58, 59, 63, 64, 65, 66 and 67 are punishable only with fine. The offences under Ss. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 60, 61, 62, 68 and 69 are made punishable also with imprisonment. Of these again, the offences under section 52, are punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years; offences under Ss. 53, 54, 55, 56, 60, and 68 are punishable with imprisonment which may extend to two years; offences under Ss. 61 and 62 are punishable with imprisonment which may extend to one year while offences under Ss. 51 and 69 are punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months only. An offence under s. 50 is punishable with imprisonment extending to one month or with fine extending to Rs. 50/. This comparison clearly shows that the legislature took a more serious view of the offence of wilful detention of a postal articles (section 52) than of many other offences in this Chapter. Delay in the conveyance or delivery of a mail bag or other postal articles in the course of transmission by a person employed to carry the same is made punishable with only a fine of Rs. 50/ (section 49). Withdrawal from duties of office without permission or without having given a month's previous, notice in writing by a person employed to carry or deliver a mail bag or postal article is also made punishable only with imprisonment extending to one month or with fine extending to Rs. 50/. Making of a false entry in the register with intention to induce the belief that an article has been delivered is made punishable with imprisonment extending to only six months or with fine extending to Rs. 100/. But Wilful, detention of a postal article is made punishable with imprisonment extending to two years. Is it reasonable to think that the legislature would prescribe this heavy punishment for detention of a postal article which was not deliberate and on purpose, while prescribing lighter punishment as mentioned above for the offences under Ss. 49, 50 and 51. We do not think so. The very fact that this comparatively heavy punishment of two years' imprisonment has been prescribed for wilful detention while lighter punishment has been prescribed under Ss. 49, 50 and 51, justifies, in our opinion, the conclusion that the word 'wilful' was used by the legislature to mean only such detention which was deliberate and for some purpose. It is interesting to notice in this connection that in the, preceding section 52 the legislature after making punishable the offence of theft of a postal article or of dishonest misappropriation of the same, also made punishable the secretion, destruction or throwing away any postal article if done 'for any purpose whatsoever'. It is, in our opinion, reasonable to think that in section 53 when the word 'wilfully' was used, the legislature also intended that the detention would be punishable only if made for some purpose. Coining now to the facts of the present case, we find that the prosecution alleged a definite purpose, viz., the purpose of theft of the contents of the envelope as the purpose with which the postal article was detained. The existence of that purpose has not, however, been established. Nothing was suggested before us as to, what other purpose the appellant could have had in detaining the article. There is, therefore, no escape from the conclusion that the detention was not deliberate and on purpose, but as a result of either inadvertence or carelessness or negligence. So, the appellant cannot be said to have detained or delayed the article 'wilfully'. Accordingly, we allow the appeal, set aside the order of conviction and sentence passed by the High Court and order that the appellant be acquitted of the charge against him. RAGHUBAR DAYAL, J. The main question to determine, in this case, is what the expression 'wilfully detains or delays' in section 53 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 (Act VI of 1898), hereinafter called the Act, means. I do not agree that it means such detention which was deliberate and for some purpose. I am of opinion that the detention or delay would be 'wilful' if it was intentional and deliberate on the part of the officer of the post office, as opposed to detention or delay on account of negligence or inadvertence. The word 'wilful' or 'wilfully' used in other enactments have been construed by Court in this manner. I may refer to some of these cases. In Taylor vs Vergette(1) 'wilful delay' has been construed ,to mean 'intional delay'. 'Wilfully' means that the act is done deliberately and intentionally, not by accident or inadvertence, but so that the mind of the person who does the act goes with it'. In Tamboli vs Great Indian Peninsular Railway Company(3) the Privy Council had to construe the expression 'wilful neglect' in determining the responsibility of the railway administration or its servants and approved of what was said by Lord Russel in Reg. vs Senior(2). (1) (2) , 290. (3) L.R. 55 I.A. 67=I.L.R. L.P(D)LSCI 20(a) 612 In Wheeler vs New Merton Board Mills, Ltd.(1) it was said: ''Wilful act' is plain English, and I can entertain no doubt that the installing of this machine without guard or fence for use in the factory was a wilful act by some one. It was an act, and it was intentional. It is true that though 'wilful' and 'intentional' are synonymous. . wilful' is more commonly used in modern speech of bad conduct or actions than of good, though it does not necessarily connote blame; but that is far from supporting the strange contention that wilful act in section 29, sub section 1, must be confined to something done with intent to injure'. In Hudson vs Official Liquidator(2) 'wilful default' was construed and it was said at p. 930: 'The adjective 'wilful' in 'wilful acts or defaults' has evidently been used as a description and not as a definition. The idea intended to be conveyed is that the default is occasioned by the exercise of volition or as the result of the non exercise of will due to supine indifference, although the defaulter knew or was in a position to know that loss or harm was likely to result. The word does not necessarily suggest the idea of moral turpitude. We have also to eliminate the elements of accident or inadvertence or honest error of judgement. The default must be the result of deliberation or intent or be the consequence of a reckless omission. 'Wilful default', therefore, is indicative of some misconduct in the transaction of business or in the discharge of duty by omitting to do something either deliberately or by a reckless disregard of the fact whether the act or omission was or was not a breach of duty'. This view was accepted by the Madras High Court in T.N.K. Govindarajulu Chetty, In re(3). The words 'wilful' and 'wilfully' have been used in the various provisions of the Act do not lead to any different interpretation of these words. Section 6 of the Act provides, inter alia, that no officer of the Post Office shall incur any liability by reason of any loss, mis delivery, delay or damage, unless he has caused the same fraudulently or by his wilful act or default. (1)[1933] 2 K.B. 669. (2) A.I.R. 1929 All. 826 (3) 1951 2. S.T.C. 27. 613 Section 48(c) provides that no suit or other legal proceeding shall be instituted against the Government or any officer of the post office in respect of the payment of any money order being refused or delayed by, or on account of, any accidental neglect, omission or mistake by, or on the part of an Officer of the post office, or for any other cause whatsoever, other than the fraud or wilful act or default such officer; and brings out effectively the contradistinction between wilful act or default of an officer and an act done on account of accidental neglect, omission or mistake. Section 49 to 70 provide for offences. Sections 49, 50 and 51 deal with offences which are committed by persons who are employed to carry or deliver any mail bag or any postal article, in course of transmission by post. They are thus offences by carriers of postal articles. They can be committed both by the officers of the postal department and by others as well. Such of the acts contemplated by those sections which can also fall under the other sections exclusively applicable to officers of the post office, will naturally be dealt with under those sections. The persons who will be dealt with under Ss. 49 to 51 or other sections providing for lighter punishments will be those who are not officers of the postal department but are concerned in any manner with the transmission of the post. Clause (c) of section 49 makes punishable the loitering or making delay in the conveyance or delivery of any mail bag or postal article, and thus emphasizes the necessity of prompt transport of postal articles. Sections 52 to 66 provide for offences by officers of a post office. Section 52 provides punishment for committing theft or dishonestly misappropriating in respect of or, for any purpose whatsoever, secreting, destroying or throwing away any postal article in the course of transmission by post or anything contained therein. The offence is punishable with imprisonment upto seven years and also with fine. This is the most serious offence. It is to be noted for our purpose that the secreting, destroying or throwing away of the postal article for any purpose whatsoever is an offence. An act done with a purpose must be a deliberate act and a, deliberate act must also be one done with some purpose. The legislature, where it intended to make the purpose behind an act an ingredient of the offence, expressly stated so. If the word 'wilful' or 'wilfully' is used in the Act as a synonym for an act done deliberately and for some purpose, the expression 'wilfully' could have been used in the place of 'for any purpose whatsoever'. This, however, the legislature did not do, though it used that word in the very next section, viz., section 53 which reads: .lm15 'Whoever, being an officer of the Post Office, contrary to his duty, opens, or causes or suffers to be opened, any postal article in course of transmission by post, or wilfully detains or delayed or causes or suffers to be detained or delayed, any such postal article, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine or with both: Provided that nothing in this section shall extend to the opening, detaining or delaying of any postal article under the authority of this Act or in obedience to the order in writing of the Central Government or the direction of a competent Court'. Sections 54, 55 and 56 make certain acts done fraudulently, knowingly or with intent, punishable with imprisonment upto two years or fine. Section 55 makes the fraudulent altering or secreting or destroying of a document which an officer of the post office is entrusted with keeping, punishable with imprisonment upto two years and with fine. This act is considered less heinous than that of secreting, destroying or throwing away of any postal article in the course of transmission by post, for any purpose whatsoever. Section 66(1) makes the master of a ship who, in certain circumstances, knowingly has in his baggage or in his possession or custody, any postal article within the exclusive privilege conferred on the Central Government by section 4, punishable with fine which may extend to Rs. 50/ for every such postal article. Here a certain act committed knowingly is made an offence. Sub section (2) of section 66 makes the detention of any postal article, after a demand for it has been made by an officer of the post office, punishable. Here, the mere detention after a demand is made penal irrespective of the intention or purpose behind such detention. Section 67 makes the detention of mails or any postal article in the course of transmission by post by anyone except under the various circumstances mentioned in the section, in offence. Here again, mere detention is made an offence irrespective of the circumstances in which it is made, excepting for reasons mentioned in the section itself. Section 68 reads: 'Whoever, fraudulently retains, or wilfully secretes or makes away with, or keeps or detains, or when required by an officer of the post office, neglects or refuses to deliver up, any postal article in course of transmission by post which ought to have been delivered to any other person, or a mail bag containing a postal, article, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, and shall also be punishable with fine'. It is to be noticed that 'wilfully' secreting any postal article in the course of transmission by post is an offence under this section. A comparison with the provisions of section 52 of the Act indicates that the legislature must have used the expresssions 'wilfully' and 'for any purpose whatsoever' in different senses. maliciously with intent to injure any person, offences. 'Wilfully' here is used as something distinct from 'maliciously' and is, further used in addition to the expression 'with intent to injure any person', that is to say, the particular purpose or intent is in ingredient of the offence in addition to 'wilfully'. Sections 6 and 48(c) provide that an officer of a post office would be liable for the loss, misdelivery, delay or of damage to any postal article in the course of transmission or for the delay in the payment of a money order, only when this happens as a result of his wilful act or default. The person suffering from such misdelivery etc., has no claim against the officer of the post office if that thing has been the result of something which could not be said to be the wilful act or default of a postal officer. It is no concern of the addressee or recipient of an article in transit by post that the wilful act or default of the postal officer was with a certain purpose or not and whether that officer succeeded in that purpose or not. :Vie should be successful in his claim if the postal officer has deliberately not acted in the manner he is required to act under the Act or the rules framed thereunder or if he has deliberately acted in violation of the duties entrusted to him. In either case, the act of the officer concerned would be wilful inasmuch as he would act intentionally in violation of his duty or in a manner in which he is not to act and not accidently or inadvertently. The provision of s.53 of the Act require that the office wilfully detains' the postal article and that the act of detention be contrary to his duty prescribed by or under the Act. Section 21(2)(c) empowers the Central Government to make rules providing for the detention and disposal of articles in course of transmission by post in certain circumstances. Sections 22(1), 23, 26. 27B and 37(2) provide for the circumstances in which postal articles can be detained or delayed. It is not necessary to detail those circumstances. The clause 'contrary to his duty' governs both the act of opening of the Postal article and to the act of detaining it. The first necessary ingredient of the offence under section 53 is that the postal officer should act contrary to his duty. Such an act, however, can take place by accident or negligence also, without the officer's knowing it or even giving any thought to it and therefore without his exercising his will in that matter. The legislature, therefore, felt that accidental or negligent acts be not made offences and that detention of the postal article, even if it be contrary to duty, be protected and that only such detention of the articles be made punishable which be committed wilfully, i.e., when the officer applied his mind towards the act and has committed it deliberately with the intention of committing it. The mere act of detaining mails or postal articles by any person other than a postal officer is made punishable only with fine under section 67 of the Act. This indicates that the punishment under section 53 is severe because the culprit is an officer of the post office who has opportunities to detain the postal article and who acts contrary to his duty. The proviso to section 53 refers to cases which would have come within the main provisions, and provides that the main provisions do not extend to the opening, detaining or delaying of any postal article under the authority of the Act or in obedience to the order in writing of the Central Government or the direction of a competent Court. Such acts would be undoubtedly deliberate and without any criminal purpose. The use of the expression 'for any purpose whatsoever' in section 52 is no guide to construe the word 'wilfully' in section 53. It appears to have been used in section 52 in contradistinction to the mens rea necessary for the commission of the offence of theft or of dishonest misappropriation. Its use makes it clear that the act of secreting, destroying or throwing away of the postal article will be punishable if with a purpose, whatever that may have been. I, therefore, construe 'wilfully' in section 53 to mean 'intentionally and deliberately' and not accidently or negligently and hold that the appellant has been rightly convicted of the offence under that section. I am further of opinion that even if the expression 'wilfully detains' in section 53 of the Act means a detention deliberate and for some purpose, the appellant is not entitled to an acquittal on the findings the Courts have arrived at. The appellant, in ordinary course of business, would have forwarded the registered letter by the mail on October 18, 1955 when it had been received at the usual hour and the appellant's contention that it was received after the despatch has not been accepted. It follows that the appellant deliberately detained the registered letter. The intention and deliberation was directed towards the detaining of the registered letter and to the non forwarding of it in due course With the mail that day. Every intentional and deliberate act must be with some purpose or object. It may be that in some cases the object be achieved by the mere doing of the act intended, that is to say, the object was just the doing of that act. In other cases, an act may be done with some further object also. The appellant's purpose behind his intentional act of detaining the registered letter must have been to remove what he might have suspected the letter to contain. If he did not have any such object, he could not have any reason to depart from his duty and detain the letter instead of sending it by the next mail in the ordinary course of his duties. His act, therefore, in detaining the letter, amounted to his detaining it wilfully. that he himself opened the letter, tempered with its contents, and removed the half currency note, facts which have been proved to have been committed by someone, does not mean that his detaining the letter was not on purpose. A person may do an act with a certain purpose and yet may not succeed in his purpose. Even if he succeeds it may not be possible for any other person to establish that he did that act for that purpose and did succeed in achieving that purpose. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. ORDER BY COURT In accordance with the majority opinion, the appeal is, allowed, the order of conviction and sentence set aside and the appellant ordered to be acquitted of the charge against him.

            "judgement": "Appeals Nos. 489 & 490 of 1961. Appeals by special leave from the award dated March 16, 1959, of the Second Industrial Tribunal, Delhi in Reference I. D. No. 20 of 1958. G.S. Pathak, section T. Desai, M. L. Sethi, B. Dutta and Anand Prakash, for the appellant (in C. A. No. 489/61) and the respondent (in C. A. No. 490/61). M. C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India M.K. Ramamurthi, D. P. Singh, R. K. Garg and S.C. Agarwal, for the respondents (in C.A. No. 489/61) and the appellants (in C. A. No. 490/61). December 14. The judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs GUPTA,. ' J. These two appeals by special leave, one by the employer and the other by the workmen, arise out of an industrial dispute that was referred for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal Delhi, by an order made on January 23, 1958 by the Chief Commissioner, Delhi. The Tribunal made its award on March 16, 1959. Out of the numerous 237 matters that were included in the terms of reference, we are concerned in these appeals only with a few. The employer challenges the award as regards : (1) Scales of pay, (2) Dearness allowance, (3) Adjustments, (4) Leave Rules, (5) Gratuity and (6) Retrospective effect of the award. The workmen also attacked the award as regards the scales of pay and dearness allowance. In addition, they have attacked the award as regards the working hours, leave rules, night shift allowance, retirement age and procedure for taking disciplinary action. At the time of the hearing before us however the learned Attorney General, appearing for the workmen, did not press their claim for modification of the award as regards, night shift allowance, leave rules and procedure for taking disciplinary action and working hours. It appears that when the dispute was before the Conciliation Officer, Delhi, for settlement an interim agreement was arrived at between the parties on December 20, 1957 by which the management agreed to give certain interim reliefs, ranging between Rs. 6/ to Rs. 10/ per month from the month of November 1957. One of the terms of the agreement was that this payment \"will be adjusted against the final outcome of the demands by constitutional means\". The Tribunal has in its award given a direction that this interim relief shall remain unaffected. Taking this to be a direction that the adjustment as agreed upon of payments under the interim arrangement shall not be made, the employer has in its appeal challenged the correctness of this direction also. The most important of the matters in dispute are the questions of the wage scale, the dearness allowance and the adjustment of existing employees into the new scales. It appears that from 1946 onwards the Company 's workmen have had a consolidated wage scale, no distinction being made between 238 the basic wage and the dearness allowance. This wage scale has remained practically unaltered except for some special increments given in the year 1948. By the award the Tribunal has introduced new wage scale for certain existing categories of workmen and in some cases has introduced new scales, after amalgamating more than one category. Thus certain railway despatchers, advertisers, Box No. sorters, filing clerks and bank clerks who were formerly in the scale of Rs. 50 4 90 EB 4 115 and Junior Clerks etc., who had a scale of Rs. 60 100EB 4 115 have all been put on a new scale of Rs. 70 5 100 EB 5 150. There has been a similar amalgamation or clerks, assistants, cashiers, record keepers and others some of whom were on Rs. 80 175 and some on Rs. 80 203 scale, all of them being now put on a new scale of Rs. 90 200. In both cases the starting salary has been raised; the maximum has been raised for the first category. Supervisors and others who were formerly on three different scales, some on Rs. 125 350, some on Rs. 125 300, and some on Rs. 100 250, have all been amalgamated and have been put on a new scale of Rs. 100 350. Obviously, this would mean a lower starting salary for some and maximum for some. ,job I)Daftries some of whom were on Rs. 70 115 scale and others on Rs. 100 155 have all been put on a new scale of Rs. 80 to Rs. 11,15, resulting thus in a lowering of starting salary for some and a rise of a higher maximum for all. A similar lowering in the starting salary has also occurred in cases of some of the jobmachinemen. They were formerly on two scales, one of Rs.125 175 and the other of Rs. 75 175. The Assistant Foremen in the job Department formerly on Rs. 125 175 are put on a scale of Rs. 125 202. Where there has been no amalgamation the new scale has resulted in a slight increase in some cases both in the starting salary and the maximum. In some catagories, no change has been made at all, 239 It is unnecessary to give more details of the difference between the old scale and the new scale as what has been mentioned above is sufficient to indicate that there has been some change in favour of the workmen, though this change is not much. The employer 's contention before us is that there was no case for any revision whatsoever and the Tribunal acted wrongly in making any change in the old wage scale. The workmen 's contention on the contrary is that the changes do not go far enough. The fixation of wage structure is among the most difficult tasks that industrial adjudication has to tackle. On the one hand not only the demands of social justice but also the claims of national economy require that attempts should be made to secure to workmen a fair share of the national income which they help to produce, on the other hand, care has to be taken that the attempt at a fair distribution does not tend to dry up the source of the national income itself On the one hand, better living conditions for workmen that can only be possible by giving them a \"living wage\" will tend to increase the nation 's wealth and income on the other hand, unreasonable inroads on the profits of the capitalists might have a tendency to drive capital away from fruitful employment and even to affect prejudicially capital formation itself. The rise in prices that often results from the rise of the workmen 's wages may in its turn affect other members of the community and may even affect prejudicially the living conditions of the workmen themselves. The effect of such a rise in price on the Country 's international trade cannot also be always ignored. Thus numerous complex factors, some of which are economic and some spring from social philosophy give rise to conflicting considerations that have to be borne in mind. Nor does the process of valuation of the numorous factors remain static. While international movements in the cause of labour have for many years influenced thinking and 240 some times even judicial thinking in such matters, in this country, the emergence of an independent demo cratic India has influenced the matter even more profoundly. Gajendragadkar, J. speaking for the Court in Standard vacuum Refining Co., of India vs Its Workmen (1), has observed : \"In constructing a wage structure in a given case industrial adjudication does take into account to some extent considerations of right and wrong, propriety and impropriety, fairness and unfairness. As the social conscience of the general community becomes more alive and active, as the welfare policy of the State takes a more dynamic form, as the national economy progresses from stage to stage, and as under the growing strength of the trade union movement, collective bargaining enters the field, wage structure ceases to be a purely arithmetical problem. Considerations of the financial position of the employer and the state of national economy have their say, and the requirements of a workman living in a civilised and progressive society also come to be recognised. \" In trying to keep true to the two points of social philosophy and economic necessities which vie for consideration, industrial adjudication has set for itself certain standards in the matter of wage fixation. At the bottom of the ladder, there is the minimum basic wage which the employer of any industrial labour must pay in order to be allowed to continue an industry. Above this is the fair wage, which may roughly be said to approximate to the need based minimum, in the sense of a wage which is \"adequate to cover the normal needs of the average employee regarded as a human being in a civilised society. \" Above the fair wage is the \"living wage\" a wage \"which will maintain the workman in the highest state of industrial efficiency, which will enable him to (1) , 543. 241 provide his family with all the material things which are needed for their health and physical well being, enough to enable him to qualify to discharge his duties as a citizen.\" (Cited with approval by Mr. justice Gajendragadkar in Standard Vacuum Company 's Case (1) from \"The living Wage\" by Philip Snowden). While industrial adjudication will be happy to fix a wage structure which would give the workmen generally a living wage economic considerations make that only a dream for the future. That is why the industrial tribunals in this country generally confine their horizon to the target of fixing a fair wage. But there again, the economic factors have to be carefully considered. For these reasons, this court has repeatedly emphasised the need of considering the problem on an industry cum region basis, and of giving careful consideration to the ability of the industry to pay. (Vide Crown Aluminium 's Case (2); the Express Newspapers Ltd., Case (8) and the Lipton 's Case (4). On an examination of the Tribunal 's award as regards the wage scale, we are satisfied that all the considerations mentioned above were present in the mind of the adjudicator and we are of opinion that there is nothing that would justify us in modifying the award either in favour of the employer or in favour of the workmen. It is stated in the award that before the Tribunal the Company 's representative desired that a fair wage level within its paying capacity should be evolved though at the time he argued that existing wage structure is quite fair \"\"looking to the Company 's financial position as well as the comparative rates prevailing in the other concern. \" The Tribunal has not accepted the Company 's contention that the existing wage structure is fair, though at the time it has held that the wage system needs no such radical change as alleged by the Union. (1) , 543. (3) (2) ; (4) [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 150. 242 Mr. Pathak, who appeared before us for the Company, did not seriously suggest that the present wage structure gives the employees \"a fair wage.\" He argued generally that no case was made out for any revision of the wage structure. Such an extreme proposition has only to be mentioned to deserve rejection. At the time the Tribunal was dealing with this question the wage scale of the workmen in this concern had remained practically unaltered for almost 12 years 12 years of momentous change through which social ideas have moved forward in favour of workmen getting a better share of the national income; 12 years during which the new India was born and a Constitution was framed for this new democracy \"to secure to all its citizens, justice, social and economic and political\" and enshrining in its 43rd Article the principle that ,the State shall endeavour to secure by suitable legislation or economic Organisation or in any other way to all workers agricultural, industrial or otherwise\" among other things tea living wage and conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities. . . . \". The mere passage of time and these revolutionary changes would be sufficient to convince any right thinking man of the need for revision of wage scales which, on the face of it, were far below the \"living wage\" and mostly also below the \" 'fair wage\", provided the industry could bear the additional burden. The case for revision becomes irresistible when one takes into consideration the further fact that the cost of living rose steeply during this period. On the basis of 1939 cost as 100, the index for 1946 was 282. By 1958 it had risen to 389. It may be mentioned that since then there has been a further rise. Nor can it be seriously suggested that this concern cannot bear the burden of an increased wage scale. The Tribunal was, in our opinion, right in its conclusion that the material on record shows that the Company has been prospering and has financial 243 stability. We have for ourselves examined the balance sheets and the other materials on the record and have no hesitation in agreeing with that conclusion. Mr. Pathak 's uphill task in the face of these balance sheets already on the record to show that the Company would not be able to bear the burden of an increased wage scale has been made more difficult by the discovery that even after the imple mentation of the award the Company has made large profits during the years 1959 60, 1960 61 and 1961 62. It appears that when the Company was given special leave to appeal to this Court the operation of the Tribunal 's award was stayed only in so far as it directed the management to pay arrears of the wages determined thereby but the operation of the award in so far as it related to the payment of wages from the date of the award was not stayed; and the management was directed to pay to the workmen from that date wages in accordance with the wage scale fixed by the Tribunal by its award under appeal. The result of this has been that the Tribunal 's award as regards the wage scales has been implemented with effect from the date of the award and it is possible for this Court to know how such additional payment has affected the financial position of the Company. It appears that after meeting the additional charges and also after payment of bonus and appropriation to reserves the net profits for the year 1959 60 rose to Rs. 8,04,508/ . For the year 1960 61 these profits were Rs. 8,44,627/ . For the year 1961 62 the profits are shown in the balance sheet as Rs. 59,955/ . That the Company has been prospering is clear. It has its own aeroplanes and possesses immovable properties of considerable value. It has built up good reserves and inspite of that it has been making good profits. It is reasonable to think that with the progress of education in the country and the increasing news mindedness of the people the future prospects of the Company are no less bright. On a consideration 244 of all this,, we are clearly of opinion that Mr. Pathak 's contention that the wage scale fixed by the Tribunal is too heavy for the Company to bear, must be rejected. Equally unacceptable is Mr. Pathak 's next contention that the wage scale fixed by the Tribunal operates unfavourably on this Company vis a vis two other concerns in Delhi region, viz., the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi. We have compared the wage scales in these two concerns viz., the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi, with the wage scale under the award and have for the purpose of comparison taken into consideration the dearness allowance as fixed by the Tribunal. The comparison shows that while in some cases the Company (the Hindustan Times) will have to pay more to its workmen than what is being paid to workmen of the same category by the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi, in several cases it will be less. It has also to be borne in mind that the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi, are much smaller units of the newspaper industry than the Hindustan Times. These Companies are mere adjuncts to the Times of India, Bombay and the Statesman, Calcutta, respectively. Therefore, even if for some categories the wage scale under the award is higher than that in the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi, that would be no ground for modifying the award in favour of the Company. We have therefore come to the conclusion that there is no ground whatsoever for modifying the wage scale fixed by the award in favour of the Company. On behalf of the workmen it was strenuously contended that the increase given by the award over the previous wage scale falls far short of justice. It is pointed out that even the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi, which are much smaller 245 concerns and of lesser financial stability and strength, pay to some categories of its workmen higher wages than what has been fixed by the award. Thus our attention has been drawn to the fact that for Assistants, the Times of India, Delhi, rate is Rs. 241 402, and in the Statesman, Delhi, it is Rs. 190 297 for some and Rs. 264 463 for others while under the award the scale is Rs. 125 375. There are several other cases also where the wage scale under the award appears to be lower than what is being paid by the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi. It has been urged by the learned Attorney General that in view of the fact that the wage scale of the Company has remained practically stationary for the last 12 years and that it is indisputably well below the fair wage and the further fact that even smaller concerns in this region, like the Times of India, Delhi and the Statesman, Delhi, have been paying more to some categories of its workmen, the wage scale as fixed by the Tribunal should be raised at least for some of the categories. There is undoubtedly some force in the contention and it maybe said that the Tribunal has been rather cautious in the matter of revision of wage scales. Even so, it has to be remembered that where, as in the present case, the proper principles have been applied by the Tribunal, it is not the practice of this Court to interfere, ordinarily, with details of this nature when exercising its special jurisdiction under article 136 of the Constitution. It also appears to us that the very fact that the Tribunal has been cautious in the matter of raising the wage scales has influenced it in the directions it has given on the question of adjustment of the present employees into the wage scale. In this way some relief has been given to the present employees which might otherwise have been given by raising the wage scale. On a consideration of all these facts we have reached the conclusion that it will not be 246 proper for us to modify the wage scales fixed by the Tribunal in favour of the workmen also. On the question of dearness allowance it is not disputed before us that in the circumstances of the resent case the Tribunal acted rightly in awarding dearness allowance at a flat rate for all categories of workmen. On behalf of the Company it was however urged that the Tribunal has made an obvious mistake in fixing the amount of dearness allowance at Rs. 25/ . For fixing the rate at Rs. 25/ the Tribunal has said : \"In view of the revised scales as now laid down, I think the same should further be supplemented in the circumstances stated above by a flat rate of dearness allowance in all cases, viz., Rs. 25/ with retrospective effect from the date of reference so that the lowest paid worker will start not less than Rs. 75/ . 1 direct accordingly. \" Mr. Pathak points out that the lowest paid worker for whom wage scales have been fixed will be getting under the award a minimum of Rs. 6l0/ so that with the dearness allowance of Rs. 25/ \"the lowest paid worker\" will start at Rs. 85/ and not Rs. 75/ . Mr. Pathak suggests that the Tribunal has made a mistake in its calculations and that having decided that the lowest paid worker will start at not less than Rs. 75/ , it should have fixed Rs. 15/ and not Rs. 25/as the dearness allowance. This argument however overlooks the fact that the reference as regards the dearness allowance was in respect of all categories of workmen, though the reference as regards scales of pay did not cover some categories, viz., mazdoors and canteen boys. They therefore continue to remain on their old scale of Rs. 50 3 85. When the Tribunal in considering the question of dearness allowance was thinking of the starting pay of the lowest paid worker 247 it had obviously these categories in mind. Having concluded that the lowest paid worker should start at Rs. 75/ as the total amount of basic pay and dearness allowance the necessary conclusion reached by the Tribunal was that Rs. 25/ should be fixed as the dearness allowance. It is, in our opinion, proper and desirable that the dearness allowance should not remain fixed at this figure but should be on a sliding scale. As was pointed out in Workmen of Hindusthan Motors vs Hindusthan Motors (1), the whole purpose of dearness allowance being to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living, it should ordinarily be on a sliding scale and provide for an increase on rise in the cost of living and a decrease on a fall in the cost of living. On a consideration of all the circumstances of this case, we direct that a sliding scale be attached to the dearness allowance of Rs. 25/ per month as awarded by the Tribunal on the lines that it will be liable to be increased or decreased on the basis of Re. 1/ for every ten points in case of rise and fall in the cost of living from the base of 400, the 1939 index being taken to be 100 the sliding scale to take effect from April 1, 1959. This brings us to the question of adjustment of the existing employees into the new scale. The Tribunal has dealt with this matter thus : \" '. the adjustment in the new scales shall be made with retrospective effect from the date of the reference, viz., 23rd January, 1958. In making adjustment in the new scales no one shall be adversely affected and it shall be on the line laid down by the Industrial Tribunal in the case of Caltex India Ltd., at p. 659 read with para. 23 of the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal, reported in at page 188. \" It appears that in the case of Caltex India Ltd. ,(Supra) the Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal, gave (1) 248 the following directions for adjustment of employees into the wage scale fixed by it. All employees for whom the scale has been stated above should be stepped up in the stage next above which the present pay is drawn. A special increment at the rate of one increment in the new scale for every three completed years of service should be given. The employees whose salaries are less than the minimum prescribed will be pulled up to the minimum of the prescribed scale. If the existing salary of an employee is higher than the salary he will be entitled to under the prescribed scale, there will be no cut and he will be stepped up to the nearest increase with the increments given above. After the salaries are adjusted, no employee should be staggered and he will continue to get future increments. If an employee be already drawing a salary which is higher than the maximum prescribed by the award, he will be subjected to no cut in his salary. \" This was followed by a direction as regards the date by which the adjustment was to be made. The Labour Appellate Tribunal modified these directions by introducing two provisions : (1) that the maximum of the grade should not be exceeded and (2) that the basic wage that was being paid to an employee at the date of the award of the Tribunal is not to be affected to the employees 'prejudice. The employer 's objection is to the provision that a special increment at the rate of one increment in the new scale for every 249 three completed years of service should be given. It is argued that such a provision may well be appropriate in a case where wage scale is being fixed for the first time or where even if there was already a wage scale in force the rate of increment in the new scale is much higher than that in the old wage scale, but not where, as in the present case, the increments under the new scale and the old scale are practically the same. We are not impressed by this argument. As was pointed out by this Court in a recent judgment in French Motor Car Co., Ltd. vs Its Workmen (1), what adjustment should be given is to be decided when fixing wage scales whether for the first time or in place of an old existing scale has to be decided by industrial adjudication after consideration of all the circumstances of the case. It may well be true that in the absence of any special circumstances and adjustment of the nature as allowed in this case by allowing special increment in the new scale on the basis of service already rendered may not be appropriate. Clearly, however, in the present case the Tribunal took into consideration in deciding this question of adjustment the fact that it had been extremely cautious as regards increasing the old wage scales. Apparently, it thought that it would be fair to give some relief to the existing employees by means of such increase by way of adjustment while at the same time not burdening the employer with higher rates of wages for new incumbents. In these circumstances, we do not see ally Justification for interfering with the directions given by the Tribunal in the matter of adjustment. It will be convenient to consider at this stage the objection raised in the Company 's appeal to the Tribunal 's direction in connection with the interim agreement. As has been stated earlier, this agreement was arrived at between the parties when the dispute was before the Conciliation Officer. The (1)(1962) 250 relevant portion of the agreement is in these words : \"It is hereby agreed between the parties that: 1. The Management agrees to make interim relief on the following terms to every employee, excluding working journalists, drawing salary up to Rs. 400 p.m. (i)Advance payment ranging between Rs. 6/ to Rs. 10/ per month beginning from the month of November, 1957 in the following manner : (a) Those with annual increment wrongful termination of Rs. 3/ , Rs. 4/ , and Rs. 5/ Rs. 6/ (b) Those with annual increment of Rs. 6/ Rs. 7/ (c) Those with annual increment of Rs. 7/ Rs. 8/ (d) Those with annual increment of Rs. 10/ Rs. 10/ Note. (i) In case any employee has already reached the ceiling of his grade, even then he would he entitled for the above benefit. (ii) This payment will be adjusted against the final out come of the present demands by constitutional means.\" \"The final out come of the present demands by constitutional means 's is the Tribunal 's award. Under the agreement therefore what has been received by 251 the workmen as advance payment at Rs. 6/ or Rs. 71or Rs. 8/ or Rs. 10/ per month as interim relief has to be adjusted against what is due to be paid to them under the award. In other words, the Company is entitled under the agreement to deduct the payments made as interim relief from what is payable to these very employees under the award. The Tribunal 's direction that the interim relief shall remain unaffected is in effect an order that term (ii) of the agreement need not be complied with. We can find no justification for such an order. While it is true that industrial adjudication can and often has to modifiy existing contracts between an employer and its workmen, there can be no justification for modification of an agreement of this nature pending final settlement of a dispute. Such a direction that the solemn words of the workmen 's representatives that interim relief which may be given will be adjusted against the relief finally given need not be complied with, is not only unfair to the employer but is also not calculated to serve the best interests of the workmen themselves. For one thing, an order of this nature in one case by a Tribunal that such an undertaking need not be carried out is likely to hamper interim settlements generally; it is also not desirable that workmen should be encouraged to treat their undertakings as of no value. Industrial adjudication must be careful not to encourage bad faith on the part of the workmen or the employer. A direction as given by the Tribunal in this case that the term in the agreement that payments made will be adjusted against the final outcome need not be complied with, is unfortunately to have such effect on workmen. We therefore set aside the Tribunal 's direction that interim relief will remain unaffected and direct that adjustments should be made in terms of the said interim arrangement. This brings us to the question of Leave Rules. The Company objects to the award as regards this matter in so far as it directs the Company to allow 15 252 day 's sick leave with full pay and allowances with accumulation up to six months on production of medical certificate given by a registered medical practitioner. It also objects to the direction that the present practice as to insistence on previous application for the purpose of casual leave should not be relaxed in cases where it cannot possibly be so done in emergent and unforeseen circumstances and the direction that up to 3 days no medical certificate should be asked for. It appears that at present the Management grants 10 days ' casual leave to the business staff and 7 days ' casual leave to all the other categories and there is no sick leave facility available. Mr. Pathak has tried to convince us that in view of the provisions of the , no provision need be made about sickness leave at all. , That this Act has been applied to the Company and that the workmen of the Company get the benefit of this Act is not disputed. It is difficult to see however how the benefit that the workmen will get under this Act can affect the question of sickness leave being provided for the workmen. This Act it has to be noticed does not provide for any leave to the workmen on the ground of sickness. It provides in section 46 (1) (a) for periodical treatment of any insured person in case of his sickness if certified by a duly appointed medical practitioner. It is unnecessary to mention here the several provisions in the Act; viz., Sections, 47, 48 and 49 which deal with the eligibility of workmen for sickness benefit and the extent of the benefit that may be granted. Section 56 of the Act provides for medical benefits to the insured workman or in certain cases to the members of his family. It appears to us clear however that in providing for periodical payments to an insured worker in case of sickness (sickness benefit) or for medical treatment or, attendance to him or the members of his family, the legislature did not intend 253 to substitute any of these benefits for the workmen 's right to get leave on full pay on the ground of sickness. It is next contended that the Tribunal 's direction as regards sickness leave offend the provisions of Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954. Admittedly, a large number of workmen covered by the reference are governed by the provisions as regards leave under the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954. Section 22 of that Act fixes the maximum for sickness or casual leave with wages to a period of 12 days and further provides that such leave shall not be accumulated. It is thus clear that as regards those workmen to whom the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954 applies the Tribunal has acted illegally in fixing the period of sick leave at 15 days and permitting accumulation. We therefore set aside this direction in the award and direct instead that the Company shall allow to the workmen to whom the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954 applies, sickness or casual leave of a total of 12 days with full pay and allowances and that such leave shall not be accumulated. We are also of opinion that it will not be right to have two separate leave rules for the two classes of workmen, one to whom the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954 applies and the other two whom it does not apply. For that is likely to be a source of much discord and heartburning. Therefore, in respect also of those workmen to whom the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954 does not apply, we think that the same period of 12 days in a year with full pay and allowances should be fixed for sickness or causal leave, and there should be no accumultation of such leave; and we direct accordingly. We cannot find any justification for the direction of the Tribunal that the practice of insistence on 254 previous application for the purpose of casual leave should be relaxed in cases where it cannot possibly be so done in emergent and unforeseen circumstances and that upto 3 days no medical certificate should be asked for. The leave rules of the Company as they now stand provide that ordinarily previous permission of the head of the department and the Establishment Manager shall be obtained before casual leave is taken but that when this is not possible due to sudden illness, the head of the Department or the Manager as soon as may be practicable should be informed in writing of the absence from work and of the probable duration of such absence. In our opinion, this provision is reasonable and is calculated to meet the needs of workmen for taking leave without previous permission, in case of emergency. In these circumstances, the further directions as regards this that have been given by the Tribunal appear to us to be unnecessary and are hereby set aside. On the question of gratuity, the only argument seriously pressed by Mr. Pathak was that the scheme as framed by the Tribunal would put undue strain on the Company 's sources. We have already expressed our agreement with the Tribunal 's conclusion that the Company 's financial resources are strong and stable and that not only has the Company been prospering in recent years but that its future prospects are also bright. Therefore, we do not think that the scheme of gratuity as framed by the Tribunal is unduly favourable to the workmen or that it places any undue strain on the Company 's financial resources. One provision in the gratuity scheme which ought to be mentioned is that under it an employee who is dismissed for misconduct shall not be entitled to any gratuity. It has been pointed out by this Court in more than one case that having regard to the nature of gratuity it will not be proper to deprive 255 an employee of the gratuity earned by him because of his dismissal for misconduct and the proper provision to make in this connection is that where an employee is dismissed for misconduct which has resulted in financial loss to the employer the amount lost should be deducted from the amount of gratuity due. As however in the present case, the workmen have not appealed against the award as regards the gratuity scheme framed by the Tribunal, it will not be proper for us to make the modification as indicated above. Coming now to the question of retirement age on which the workmen have appealed, we find there is some controversy as regards the existing position. The workmen stated in their written statement before the Tribunal that \" 'at present there are no set rules in the Company in this matter. \" Their claim was that the retirement age should be fixed at 60 for all the employees of the Company. According to the Management 's written statement \"the existing superannuation system is that the age of retirement is fixed at 55.\" The Magagement further stated that the age of retirement \" 'as fixed, that is, 55 years\" is appropriate and should not be raised. In respect of this controversy as regards the existing position there appears to be little material on the record. From the appointment letters of some of the employees that we find on the record it appears that for some appointments made in 1955 the age of retirement was mentioned as 55. In the several letters of appointments made prior to that year no age of retirement has been mentioned. It is not clear, therefore, how on the question of retirement age the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that the \"existing retirement\" age is 55. Proceeding on this basis the Tribunal directed \"that the existing retirement age at 55 years should continue but the workers may be allowed to remain in employment and work up to 60 years if found fit. The question of the further extension 256 should rest with the discretion of the Management. \" On behalf of the workmen the learned Attorney General has contended that the assumption that the existing retirement age is 55 is wrong in respect of most of the workmen and that except for a few persons appointed after 1955 no retirement age is fixed either in the letters of appointment or in the standing orders of the Company. For all these employees for whom no retirement age has been fixed already, the learned Attorney General argued on the basis of the decision of this Court in Guest Keen, Williams Private Ltd., vs P. J. Sterling., (1) that it would not be fair to fix any age of superannuation. It was held in that case that it was unfair to fix the age of superannuation of previous employees by a subsequent standing order. The Labour Appellate Tribunal had held that it would be unreasonable and unfair to introduce a condition of retirement at 55 in regard to the prior employees having regard to the fact that when they entered service there was no such limitation. This Court felt that it would not be justified in reversing this decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal. Dealing next with the question whether it followed that there should be no rule of superannuation in regard to these previous employees the Court said : \"In our opinion it is necessary to fix the age of superannuation even with regard to the prior employees, and we feel no difficulty in holding that it would not be unfair or unreasonable to direct that these employees should retire on attaining the age of 60. An option to continue in service even thereafter which the respondent claimed is wholly unreasonable and is entirely inconsistent with the notion of fixing the age of superannuation itself. Once the age of superannuation is fixed it may be open to the employer for special reasons to continue in its employment a workman who has passed that (1) ; 257 age : but it is inconceivable that when the age of superannuation is fixed it should be in the option of the employee to continue in service thereafter. We would accordingly hold that in the circumstances of this case the rule of retirement for the previous employees in the concern should be 60 instead of 55 and that the rule of 55 should apply to all employees who enter the service of the appellant after the relevant standing orders came into force.\" Assuming therefore that for the majority of the employees there is no existing retirement age it would on the authority of the above case, be open to the Tribunal to fix the age of superannuation even with respect to them. As however the Tribunal 's decision that this age should be 55 is vitiated by the incorrect assumption that there is an existing retirement age of 55 it has been necessary for us to consider the question for ourselves. It appears that before the Tribunal the Union 's representative himself desired that the retirement age should be fixed at 58 years which may be extended up to 60 years in fit cases. Before us the Counsel for the Company did not seriously contest that in consideration of the present day circumstances in the country it would be fair to fix the retirement age at 58. Accordingly, we set aside the Tribunals award on this question of retirement age and fix the age at 58 years, subject to the proviso that it will be open to the Company to continue in its employment a workman who has passed that age. This rule should apply to all the employees of the Company. There remains for consideration the question of retrospective operation of the award. Under section 17A of the , an award shall come into operation with effect from such date as may be specified therein but where no date is so specified it shall come into 258 operation on the date when the award becomes enforceable. Even without a specific reference being made on this question it is open to an industrial tribunal to fix in its discretion a date from which it shall come into operation. The reference, in the present case, included as a matter in dispute the question of retrospective effect in these words : \"Whether all the above demands should be made applicable retrospectively with effect from April 1, 1956 and what directions are necessary in this respect ?\" The Tribunal rejected the workmen 's claim for giving effect to its award from April 1956. Wherever however the Tribunal has given relief the Tribunal has directed that the award should come into effect from the date of reference, i. e., January 23, 1958. On behalf of the Company Mr. Pathak contends that there is no reason why the award should be given effect to from any date prior to the date of its pronouncement. We are not impressed by this argument . No general formula can be laid down as to the date from which a Tribunal should make its award effective. That question has to be decided by the Tribunal on a consideration of circumstances of each case. There have been cases where this Court has made an award effective from the date when the demand was first made. There are other cases where the orders of the Tribunal directing the award to be made effective from the date of the award has not been interfered with. It is true that in some cases this Court has modified the Tribunal 's award in such a case. But it does not appear however that any general principles have been laid down. Indeed, it is difficult and not even desirable that this Court should try to lay down general principles on such matters that require careful consideration of the 259 peculiar circumstances of each case for the exercise of discretion. It is sufficient to say that we find no reason to interfere with the Tribunal 's direction in this case that the reliefs given by it would become effective from the date of the reference. We therefore allow both the appeals in part by modifying the Tribunal 's award as regards dearness allowance, leave rules and retirement age and also as regards the adjustment of the interim relief as mentioned above. In all other matters in appeal before us the award is confirmed. The modifications made as regards dearness allowance will, as already stated, take effect from April 1, 1959. The modifications as regards leave rules and as regards retirement age will take effect from this date. In both the appeals the parties will bear their own costs. Appeals allowed in part.",

Mahajan, Mrs. Urmila Kapoor and Mrs. Shobha Dikshit for the Appellants. Hardev Singh for the Respondent. 465 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA, J.

Initially, the tax was Rs. 15/ per annum and was levied on all the partners of the said firm. By a Notification, dated July 4, 1958, the annual tax for trade, profession or calling for the owner of a factory registered under the Indian Factories Act, was raised to Rs. 200/ per annum and each of the six partners of the said firm were assessed to annual tax of Rs. 200/ by the Municipal Committee. On October 30, 1960, the appellants filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the defendant Committee from realising the profession tax demanded by it per letters Nos. 15 to 20, dated May 31, 1960, amounting to Rs. 1,200/ . The appellants challenged the validity of the assessment contending that construed in the light of the definition given in section 2(40) of the Punjab General Clauses Act, the term 'person' occurring in section 6(1)(b) of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911, includes a 'firm ' and since the trade carried on by the 'firm ' is one, the tax could be levied only on the firm, and not on the partners individually. On these premises, it was pleaded that the Municipal Committee in levying the tax on the individual partners had exceeded its statutory powers under Section 61(1)(b) of the Municipal Act. The trial court dismissed the suit. On appeal by the plaintiffs, the Additional District Judge, Amritsar, reversed the judgment of the trial court and decreed the suit. The Municipal Committee carried a further appeal to the High Court. The learned Single Judge, who heard the appeal, affirmed the judgment and decree of the first appellate court, on the reasoning which may be summed up as under: The term 'person' in Section 61(1)(b) of the Municipal Act, interpreted in the light of the definition given in Section 2(40) of the Punjab General Clauses Act, includes a 'partnership '. Under clause (b) of Section 61(1) of the Municipal Act, the basis on which the liability to pay tax arises, is the trade, profession or business; and if the trade and business is one carried on by several persons collectively in partnership, then the partnership alone, and not the individual partners, are liable to pay the tax; that the liability on the partners will fall twice which is not contemplated by the scheme and language of the Municipal Act, even though all the partners are jointly and severally liable to any tax for the partnership business. In support of his conclusion that the tax was on trade and not on persons, the learned Judge by way of analogy, referred to clauses (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of sub Section (1). He also referred to two Madras decisions in The Municipal Commissioners of Nagapatam vs Sadaya Pillay(1) and Davies vs President of the Madras Municipal Commission(2): and found himself in entire agreement with the reasoning of the learned Judges in those cases. Aggrieved, the Municipal Committee preferred a Letters Patent Appeal. The Appellate Bench of the High Court held that to import the definition of the term 'person' occurring in Section 2(40) of the Punjab General Clauses Act into Section 61(1) (b) of the Municipal Act, will be repugnant to the subject. In the opinion of the Bench, under the scheme of the statute in question, the tax cannot be levied on a firm or factory as such, but only on the individual owners of the factory or of the firm. On this reasoning, the Bench reached the conclusion 'that under Section 61(1) (b) of the Act, it is the individual who is to be assessed and is liable to pay the tax mentioned therein and so the assessment as well as the demand of the tax from each of the plaintiffs does not suffer from any legal infirmity.' The Bench further held that since the Committee in imposing the tax on the appellants herein, has not acted outside the provisions of the statute, 'it would, on the basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Firm Seth Radha Kishan (Deceased) represented by Hari Kishan & Ors. vs Administrator Municipal Committee, Ludhiana,(3) which also dealt with the provisions of the Municipal Act, follow that the impugned assessment could only be questioned under the provisions of Sections 84 and 86 of the Act, and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in respect of tax levied or the assessment made is excluded'. In the result, the appeal was allowed and the trial court 's decision dismissing the suit was restored. Before us, Mr. V. K. Mahajan, learned counsel for the plaintiffs appellants, has adopted the reasons given by the learned Single Judge of the High Court. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the aforesaid Madras decisions. His argument is that if the interpretation placed by the Appellate Bench of the High Court is allowed to stand, it will lead to anamolous and unconstitutional results. Mr. Mahajan concedes that the individual partners are also 'persons ' within the meaning of clause (b) of Section 61(1). He, however, maintains that the firm, also, is a 'person ' within the contemplation of this provision and as such, liable to be taxed; that if in respect of the one trade, which is being carried on by the firm, apart from each of the individual partners, the firm, also is separately assessed to Rs. 200/ per annum, not only the incidence of the tax will fall twice, the total liability therefor will far exceed the ceiling of Rs. 250/ per annum fixed by Article 276(2) of the Constitution. In these premises, it is contended that an interpretation of Section 61(1) (b), which may lead to unconstitutional on irrational results should be eschewed. With regard to the question of jurisdiction it is contended that since the Municipal Committee had in the exercise of its powers clearly acted beyond its jurisdiction, the suit was maintainable in the Civil Court. Section 61(1)(b) of the Municipal Act, so far as material for this case, reads as under: 'Subject to any general or special orders which the State Government may make in this behalf, and the rules, any committee may, from time to time for the purposes of this Act, and in the manner directed by this Act, impose in the whole or any part of the municipality any of the following taxes, namely: (1) (a). . . . (i) to (iii) . . . . (b) a tax on persons practising any profession or art or carrying on any trade or calling in the municipality. Explanation. A person in the service or person holding an office under the State Government or the Central Government or a local or other public authority shall be deemed to be practising a profession within the meaning of this sub section.' From a plain reading of the extracted provision, it is clear that a tax leviable under clause (b) is, in terms, a tax on 'persons'. The expression 'persons' undoubtedly includes natural persons. The class of such taxable persons has been indicated by the Legislature with reference to their occupational activity. Thus, in order to be authorised, a tax under clause (b) of Section 61(1) must satisfy two conditions: 468 First, it must be a tax on 'persons'. Second such persons must be practising any profession or art or carrying on any trade or calling in the municipality. There can be no dispute that the appellants are 'persons' and, as such, satisfy the first condition. Even the learned counsel for the appellants has candidly conceded that the individual partners are also 'persons' within the meaning of the said clause (b). Controversy thus becomes narrowed down into the issue; Whether persons collectively doing business in partnership, in the municipality, fulfil the second condition ? That is to say, do such persons 'carry of any trade or calling in the municipality' within the contemplation of clause (b) ? In our opinion, for reasons that follow, the answer to this question must be in the affimative. 'Partnership ' as defined in Section 4 of the , is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them for the benefit of all. The Section further makes it clear that a firm or partnership is not a legal entity separate and distinct from the partners. Firm is only a compendious description of the individuals who compose the firm. The crucial words in the definition of 'partnership ' are those that have been underlined. They hold the key to the question posed above. They show that the business is carried on by all or any of the partners. In the instant case, admittedly, all the plaintiff appellants are carrying on the business in partnership. All the six partners are sharing the profits and losses. All the partners are jointly and severally responsible for the liabilities incurred or obligations incurred in the course of the business. Each partner is considered an agent of the other. This being the position, it is not possible to hold that each of the six partners is not carrying on a trade or calling within the purview of clause (b) of Section 61(1) of the Municipal Act. At the most, it can be said that each of these six persons is severally as well as collectively carrying on a trade in the Municipality. There is nothing in the language of Section 61 or the scheme of the Municipal Act which warrants the construction that persons who are carrying on a trade in association or partnership with each other cannot be individually taxed under clause (b) of Section 61(1). On the contrary, definite indication is available in the language and the scheme of this statute that such partners can be taxed as persons in their individual capacity. As noticed already, clause (b) makes it clear in no uncertain terms that this is a tax on 'persons.' Its incidence falls on individuals, who belong to a class practising any profession or art; or carrying on a trade or calling in the municipality. 469 To hold that persons who are collectively carrying on a trade in the municipality cannot be taxed individually, would be to read into the statute words which are not there. There are no words in clause (b) or elsewhere in the statute which, expressly or by necessary implication, exclude or exempt persons carrying on a trade collectively in the municipality from being taxed as individuals. To attract liability to a tax under this clause, it is sufficient that the person concerned is carrying on a trade in the municipality, irrespective of whether such trade is being carried on by him individually or in partnership with others. Thus, both the conditions necessary for levying a tax under clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 61 of the Municipal Act existed in this case. The appellants are 'persons' and they are carrying on a trade in Chheharata Municipality. In the view we take, we do not think it necessary to go further into the question, whether the definition of 'person ' given in Section 2(40) of the Punjab General Clauses Act, can be imported into the statute under consideration, so as to include a contractual firm, also, within the purview of the expression 'persons ' used in clause (b) of Section 61(1). Indeed, the entire effort to import the definition of 'person ' given in the General Clauses Act, into Section 61(1)(b) of the Municipal Act, is directed to find a foundation for the argument, that the construction adopted by the High Court could lead to double taxation and even unconstitutional results. But in the instant case, nothing of this kind has happened. The firm has not been assessed. No question of double taxation or exceeding the Constitutional ceiling of Rs. 250/ fixed by Article 276(2) of the Constitution, arises on the facts of the present case. The arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants on this aspect of the matter are merely hypothetical, and speculative. This takes us to the second question, whether the Civil Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit. Section 84(1) of the Punjab Municipal Act provides that 'an appeal against the assessment or levy of any. tax under this Act, shall lie to the Deputy Commissioner or to such other officer as may be empowered by the State Government in this behalf'. Then, there is a proviso to this sub section which says that when the Deputy Commissioner or such other officer, as aforesaid, is or was, when the tax was imposed, a member of the Committee, the appeal shall lie to the Commissioner of the Division. Sub section (2) is important. It provides: '84(2). If, on the hearing of an appeal under the section, any question as to the liability to, or the principle of assessment of, a tax arises, on which the officer hearing the appeal entertains reasonable dobut, he may, either of his own 470 motion or on the application of any person interested, draw up a statement of the facts of the case and the point on which doubt is entertained, and refer the statement with his own opinion on the point for the decision of the High Court.' Section 86 mandates that 'no objection shall be taken to any valuation or assessment, nor shall the liability of any person to be assessed or taxed be questioned, in any other manner or by any other authority than is provided in this Act.' From a conjoint reading of sections 84 and 86, it is plain that the Municipal Act, gives a special and particular remedy for the person aggrieved by an assessment of tax under this Act, irrespective of whether the grievance relates to the rate or quantum of tax or the principle of assessment. The Act further provides a particular forum and a specific mode of having this remedy which analogous to that provided in Section 66 (2) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922. Section 86 forbids in clear terms the person aggrieved by an assessment from seeking his remedy in any other forum or in any other manner than that provided in the Municipal Act. It is well recognised that where a Revenue Statute provides for a person aggrieved by an assessment thereunder, a particular remedy to be sought in a particular forum, in a particular way, it must be sought in that forum and in that manner, and all other forums and modes of seeking it are excluded. Construed in the light of this principle, it is clear that sections 84 and 86 of the Municipal Act bar, by inevitable implication' the jurisdiction of the Civil Court where the grievance of the party relates to an assessment or the principle of assessment under this Act. In the view we take, we are fortified by the decision of this Court in Firm Seth Radha Kishan vs Administrator, Municipal Committee, Ludhiana, (supra) wherein sections 84 and 86 of this very Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 came up for consideration. Therein, the Municipal Committee, Ludhiana, imposed a terminal tax on Sambhar salt and assessed the appellant, therein, to a sum of Rs. 5,893/ towards that tax at the rate of Rs. 10/ per maund under item 69 of the Government Notification by which the terminal tax was imposed. The assessee filed a suit against the Municipal Committee in the Civil Court, contending that Sambhar salt ought to have been assessed at the rate of 3 pies per maund under item 68, that he had been illegally assessed under item 69 at the higher rate, and claimed refund of the amount paid by him, with interest. The Committee, inter alia, contended that Sambhar salt was not common salt, and the Civil Courtmove to sidebar had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The trial court held that Sambhar salt was common salt within the meaning of item 68 of the Schedule, that 471 the imposition of tax on it under item 69 of the Schedule was illegal, and, therefore, the Civil Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit by virtue of section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On appeal, the High Court held that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction, and dismissed the suit. The assessee came in appeal to this Court by certificate granted by the High Court, and contended that since the impugned levy was not made under the Municipal Act but in derogation thereof, the Civil Court had jurisdiction to entertain and determine the suit. Delivering the judgment of the Court, Subba Rao, J. (as he then was) repelled this contention, observing that the rate of the tax to be levied depended upon the character of the salt, and it was not possible to say that in ascertaining this fact the authorities concerned travelled outside the provisions of the Municipal Act, even if they wrongly applied item 69 of the schedule; that the mistake in applying the wrong item of the Schedule to the tax could be corrected only in the manner prescribed by the Act, and the aggrieved person cannot file a suit in the Civil Court in that regard, the Civil Court 's jurisdiction having been excluded by the provisions of Sections 84 and 86 of the Act. The Court distinguished that class of cases where the Municipal Committee in levying a tax or committing an Act, clearly acts outside or in abuse of its powers under the Municipal Act, and explained that it is only in such cases, the bar to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court would not apply. Can the case before us be said to belong to that class of cases where the Municipal Committee in levying a Tax acts beyond or in abuse of its powers under the Act ? The answer to this question must be in the negative. By no stretch of imagination, can it be said in the facts and circumstances of the case, that in assessing the appellants, individually, and not collectively, to the tax in question, the Municipal Committee abused its powers under the Act. We have already discussed and held that in levying this tax, the Municipal Committee did not travel beyond or act contrary to the provisions of Section 61(1)(b) of the Act. In short, the present case is one where the Municipal Committee acted 'under the Act'. It follows, therefore, that the Civil Court 's jurisdiction to entertain and decide the suit was barred, even if the dispute raised therein related to the principle of assessment to be followed. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. V.D.K. Appeal dismissed",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal No. 1520 (NT) of 1986. From the Judgment and Order dated 10.8.1977 of the Bombay High Court in I.T.R. No. 34 of 1968. V.S. Desai and Ms. A. Subhashini for the Appellant. Harish Salve, Mrs. A.K. Verma and Joel Peres for the Respondents. Three private limited companies, the Italindia Cotton Co. (P) Ltd., who is the assessee before us, the India Corporation (P) Ltd and the International Cotton (P) Ltd. were controlled by three groups of share holders, who may be described as the Chunilal Group, the Babubhai Group and the Purushottam Group. There was a change in the share holding of the three companies during the accounting year ending 31 March, 1963. The Chunilal Group acquired controlling interest in India Corporation (P) Ltd., the Babubhai group acquired controlling interest in the assessee company and the Purushottam Group acquired controlling interest in International Cotton (P) Ltd. The assessee suffered a loss in the accounting year ending 31 March 1960, relevant to the assessment year 1960-61, in the amount of Rs.12,172. This was available for a set off in a subsequent year. But having regard to the change in the share holding of the assessee during the accounting year ending 31 March, 1963 relevant to the assessment year 1964-64, the question arose whether the assessee was entitled to of carrying forward that loss for the purpose of computing its assessable profits for that assessment year. The Income tax Officer held that section 79 of the Income tax Act, 1961 disentitled the assessee from claiming such a set off. He said that 51% of the voting power held by persons on the last day of the year in which the loss was suffered was no longer held by them on 31 March, 1963. On appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income tax took a different view. He held that before the right to set off a loss could be denied to an assessee, not only should there be a change in the persons holding a voting power of not less than 51% but further the change should have been effected with a view to avoiding or reducing the liability to tax. The Revenue appealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. Upon an analysis of section 79 the Tribunal observed that the denial of the set off of a loss incurred in an earlier year was subject to two exceptions, the first being that the beneficial holding representing not less than 51% of the voting power should not change hands between the last day of the year in which the loss was incurred and the last day of the relevant previous year, and the second exception was that any change in the share holding contemplated by the parent provision should not have been effected with a view to avoiding or reducing any liability to tax. According to the Tribunal the two exceptions applied independently, and if either came into play the prohibition contained in section 79 against the setting off of a loss could not be invoked by the Revenue. It appears to have been admitted before the Tribunal that the assessee was not entitled to the benefit of the first exception, and in the view which it took it rendered no definite finding on whether the assessee fell within the terms of the second exception. At the instance of the assessee the Tribunal referred the following question to the Bombay High Court for its opinion: 'Whether both the conditions mentioned in clause (a) and clause (b) of section 79 must apply for disentitling the loss of a prior year being allowed as set off in accordance with the substantive provisions of section 79 of the Income tax Act, 1961?' The High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee, holding that even if a change in the voting power of not less than 51% between the two relevant dates has taken place, for the Revenue to succeed such change should be effected with a view to avoiding or reducing any liability to tax. It observed that as the Tribunal had not considered the question whether the change in the voting power had taken place with a view to avoiding or reducing any liability to tax that question should now be decided by the Tribunal before the claim for a set off could be finally disposed of. And now this appeal. Chapter VI of the Income tax Act, 1961 contains a number of provisions entitling the assessee to the carry forward and set off of a loss suffered by him. Section 70 provides for the set off of a loss from one source against income from another source under the same head of income. Section 71 provides for the set off of a loss from one head against income from another head. Section 72 entitles an assessee to carry forward and set off a business loss which could not be set off wholly during the year in which it arose. Then follow provisions relating to the setting off of losses in certain particular cases. Section 79, with which we are concerned, provides: 'Notwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter, where a change in shareholding has taken place in a previous year in the case of a company, not being a company in which the public are substantially interested, no loss incurred in any year prior to the previous year shall be carried forward and set off against the income of the previous year unless (a) on the last day of the previous year the shares of the company carrying not less than fifty one per cent of the voting power were beneficially held by persons who beneficially held shares of the company carrying not less than fifty one per cent of the voting power on the last day of the year or years in which the loss was incurred; or (b) the Income tax Officer is satisfied that the change in the share holding was not effected with a view to avoiding or reducing any liability to tax.' Section 79 is an exception to the scheme enacted in Chapter VI for the carry forward and setting off of a loss incurred in any earlier year against the income of the relevant previous year. The provision was enacted in the Income tax Act 1961 for the first time in order to deny that benefit to companies not being companies in which the public are substantially interested. On its plain terms section 79 provides that in the case of such companies, if a change in shareholding has taken place in a previous year, no loss incurred in any year prior to the previous year shall be carried forward or set off against the income of the previous year unless (a) both on the last day of the previous year and on the last day of the year or years in which the loss was incurred the shares of the company carrying not less than 51 per cent of the voting power were beneficially held by the same persons (b) the Income tax Officer is satisfied that the change in the share in holding was not affected with a view to avoiding or reducing any liability to tax. The question before us is whether the two conditions operate cumulatively or in the alternative. In other words, should both conditions exist together to nullify the prohibition against carry forward and set off of the loss? Upon careful consideration we are of opinion that the conditions are intended to operate as alternative to one another. If the terms of either cl.(a) or cl.(b) are satisfied, the disqualification suffered by a company, by reason of a change in share holding in the previous year, is removed, and the company is entitled to the benefit of the provisions in Chapter VI relating to the carry forward and set off of losses. The benefit is available notwithstanding the change in share holding in the previous year, if shares representing not less than 51% of the voting power remain beneficially held by the same persons on the relevant dates. Similarly, the benefit is available notwithstanding the change in shareholding in the previous year if the change was not effected with a view to avoiding or reducing any liability to tax. The object sought to be served by enacting section 79 appears to be to discourage persons claiming a reduction of their tax liability on the profits earned in companies which had sustained losses in earlier years. It was not unusual for a group of persons to acquire a company, which had suffered losses in earlier years, in the expectation that the company would earn substantial profits after such acquisition, and they would benefit by a reduction of the tax liability on those profits on a set off of losses carried forward from earlier years before the acquisition. The acquisition of a company in such a case would be effected by a change in its share holding and the control over the company could be ensured by securing the beneficial ownership of shares carrying 51 per cent or more of the voting power. If the change in share holding did not result in holding voting power of 51 per cent or it was established that the shares of the company carrying not less than 51 percent of the voting power were beneficially held by the same persons, both on the last day of the previous year as well as the last day of the year or years in which the loss was incurred, it could be presumed that there was no change in the control over the company, and the disqualification imposed on the company because of the change in its share holding would stand removed. But there may be a change in the share holding, and it may result in a change of control of the company. Yet every such change of shareholding need not fall within the prohibition. There can be a case where persons already owing a shareholding carrying less than 51 percent of the voting power in the company may enlarge their share holding during the previous year in order that control over the company may pass to them. Attempts to acquire control over a company by controlling a majority of the share holding are not unknown. The acquisition of control over a company provides a source of both direct and indirect financial benefit as well as power over its policies and activities. On the other side, there can be a case where the change is affected with a view to avoiding or reducing some liability to tax. The change is effected not for business or commercial reasons but in order that tax liability may be avoided or reduced. In that event, the change in the share holding will tend to bring about the result which section 79 was designed to prevent. In our opinion, to avoid falling within the scope of section 79 it is sufficient for the assessee to show that the case attracts either cl. (a) of cl. If the assessee succeeds in doing so, he will be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Income Tax Act entitling him to claim a carry forward and set off losses suffered by the company in an earlier year or years against the income of the previous year. We are fortified in our conclusion by the view expressed by the Gujarat High Court in Commissioner of Income tax, Gujarat III vs Shri Subhalaxmi Mills Ltd., and by the Madras High Court in Commissioner of Income tax vs Saravanabhava Mills Pvt Ltd.,[1983] I.T.R.856. In our judgment, the High Court is right in the view taken by it and the appeal must be dismissed. The appeal is dismissed with costs.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeals Nos. 356 and 357 of 1961. Appeals by special leave and certificate from the judgment and orders dated October 16, 1959, and February 16,1960, of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in L. P. A. No. 93 of 1957 and Misc. Petition No. 254 of 1959 respectively. 152 section T. Desai and N. H. Hingorani, for the appellant. M. R. Nambiar, section N. Andley, Rameshwar Nath and P. L. Vohra, for respondent No. 1. 1960. October 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J. These two appeals by special leave have been filed by the Municipal Committee, Raipur, against two different respondents who carry on business of extraction of oil from oil seeds. The case involves an interpretation of the Byelaws of the Municipal Committee and the determination of octroi duty which was payable by the respondents in the relevant years of assessment on sarso oil seeds brought by them within the area of the appellant Committee for purposes of their business. The Municipal Committee demanded an ad valorem octroi duty Rs. 4 11 0 per cent from the respondents, claiming to levy it under item 44 of the Schedule of goods liable to octroi duty in the Raipur Municipality, appended to the Rules framed on June 4, 1951. The respondents, on the other hand contended that a duty of 2 annas per maund was leviable under item 4 of the same Schedule, which covered the case of oil seeds. The respondents made representations described as appeals, but were unsuccessful. Their demand for refund of octroi duty paid by them was refused and they, therefore, filed petitions under article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Nagpur (later, of Madhya Pradesh) against the appellants alleging inter alia that this imposition of octroi duty ad valorem at Rs. 4 11 0 percent on sarso oil seeds as against other oil seeds was ultra vires the Municipal Committee under article 14 of the Constitution. They also averred that octroi duty was properly leviable under item 4 and not under item 44. In the High Court, the petition out of which Civil Appeal No. 356 of 1961 arises, was heard by a learned single Judge, who held that 153 sarso oil seeds were chargeable to duty under item 44 and not under item 4. From the order of the learned single Judge, it does appear that the constitutional question was urged before him. Against this order, a Letters Patent Appeal was filed, and the Divisional Bench, which heard the appeal, held, disagreeing with the learned single Judge, that duty was properly leviable only under item 4. Before the Divisional Bench also, it does not appear that the constitutional question was argued. The petition, out of which Civil Appeal No. 357 of 1961 arises was heard by a Divisional Bench, which, following the earlier decision, decided against the appellant Committee. The entries in the Schedule of goods liable to octroi duty in the Raipur Municipality contain eight classes of goods. Under them are grouped 67 items, the serial numbers running consecutively through all the classes. Class I is headed 'Articles of food or drink or use for men or animals'. Item 4, which is in that Class reads 'Oil seeds of every description not specifically mentioned elsewhere'. Class V is headed 'Drugs, spices and gums, toilet requisites and perfumes', and item 44 reads 'Betel nuts, gums, spices, Indian herbs and Indian raw medicines and drugs, such as nuts, ilaichi, laung, jaiphal, jaipatri, dalchini., sont, katha, zeera, Dhania garlic, dry chillies, pepper, shahzeera, maithi, sarso, etc. and known as kirana' (groceries). Item 4 is chargeable to a duty of 2 annas per maund, and item 44 is chargeable ad valorem at Rs. 4 11 0 per cent. In addition to these entries, there is item 17, which reads 'Vegetable oils (not hydrogenated) not provided elsewhere such as Tilli Tel, Sarso Tel, Alsi Tel, Falli Tel, Narial Tel, Andi Tel ', which are chargeable to a duty of 4 annas per maund. It is conceded on all hands that sarso is an oil seed, and if there was nothing more in the Schedule a duty of 2 annas per maund would be leviable on sarso as an oil seed. The dispute arises, because 154 sarso is mentioned again in Item 44 with a very much higher duty, and it is contended by the appellant Committee that the words 'not specifically mentioned elsewhere' in item 4 exclude sarso from that item, and that its specific mention in item 44 makes it liable to the higher duty indicated there. The learned single Judge of the High Court held in favour of the Municipality. According to him, this reason was sound and the higher duty demanded was the proper duty payable. The Divisional Bench on the other hand, points out that the two classes (I and V) are entirely different. Class 1 deals with articles of food or drink for use for men and animals while Class V deals with drugs, spices and gums, toilet requisites and perfumes. The division indicates clearly that goods belonging to one category are not included in the goods belonging to the other. The Divisional Bench also points out that item 4 must be read as it stood and the specific mention must be in the same manner in which that entry was framed. Item 4 deals with 'oil seeds', and the specific mention must be as 'oil seeds' elsewhere in the Schedule. It was also argued for the respondents that 'elsewhere' meant elsewhere in the same Class. But the appellant Committee pointed out that the serial numbers were all consecutive, and that the specific mention could be anywhere in the Schedule. The two arguments are equally plausible, and nothing much, therefore turns upon them. In our opinion, the Divisional Bench of the High Court was right when it said that the specific mention elsewhere must be as oil seeds and not as something else. Class V deals with spices and groceries and the concluding words of item 44 known as 'kirana' determine the ambit of that item. Though sarso might be mentioned there, it must be taken to have been mentioned as a spice or as kirana and not as oil seed. The extent of item 4, which deals with oil seeds of every descrip 155 tion, could only be cut down by a specific mention elsewhere of an item as an oil seed. Item 44 contains fairly long list, out of which we have quoted a few illustrative items. Each of these items is referable to the general heading either as a drug or a spice or gum, etc. Sarso, it is admitted, is sold as kirana and as a spice. The mention of sarso there is limited by the general heading to which it belongs, namely, a spice, drug or herb sold as kirana. No doubt, sarso as an oil seed is the same article as sarso sold as kirana but we must take into account the intention behind the bye law and give effect to it. If it was intended that sarso as an oil seed was to be taxed in a special way, it would be reasonable to expect that it would have be found a specific in mention as an oil seed with a different duty. One would not expect that it would be included in a long list of articles of kirana and in this indirect way be taken out from a very comprehensive entry like item 4, where oil seeds of every description are mentioned. Though the next argument is not conclusive because there is no logic behind a tax, still it is to be noticed that sarso oil (a maund of which, as the affidavit of the respondents shows, is expressed from three maunds of oil seed) bears only an octroi duty of 4 annas per maund, while three maunds of sarso oil seed under item 44, if it were applicable, bear a duty of Rs. 4 3 6 per maund, if the price of sarso is taken as Rs. 30 per maund as stated in the affidavit. This leads to an anomaly, which, in our opinion, could hot have been intended. Finally, it may be said that if there be any doubt, the Divisional Bench of the High Court very properly resolved it in favour of the taxpayer. We, therefore, hold that the judgment of the High Court is correct, and dismiss these appeals with costs. Appeals dismissed.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal Nos. 801 and 802 of 1962. Appeals from the judgment and decree dated August 11, 1960 of the Bombay High Court in First Appeals Nos. 819, 820 of 1955. Purshottam Trikamdas, V.J. Jhaveri and S.N. Andley for the appellants (in both the appeals). K.H. Bhabha, Iqbal Chagla and J.B. Dadachanji, for the respondent (in both the appeals). The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bachawat, J. The Bank of Poona Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as the Company) now amalgamated with the Sangli Bank, Ltd. was incorporated in 1945. The Company was promoted by N.G. Parulekar and Murlidhar Chaturbhuj Loya. The authorised capital of the Company was Rupees fifty lakhs divided into 50,000 ordinary shares of Rs. 100/ each. By the end of April, 1946, the Company was able to find subscribers for 4,860 shares only. In view of section 277(1) of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, the Company was unable to carry on business unless the subscribed capital was not less than half the authorised capital. In order to comply with the requirements of section 277(1), the directors of the Company decided that they or their nominees would subscribe for a large number of shares. Narayandas Shriram Somani was one of the directors of the Company. Ramnath Shriram Somani is his brother. They carried on business in the name of Ramkisan Ramratan Somani. Jivanbai is the mother of Narayandas and Ramnath, Goverjabai is the wife of Narayandas, and Kamalabai is the wife of Ramnath. Narayandas decided to subscribe for 2000 shares in the names of the three ladies. At a meeting held on May 25, 1946, the board of directors of the Company allotted 500 shares to Goverjabai, 500 shares to Kamalabai and 1000 shares to Jivanbai against three separate applications for shares signed by them. The applications were accompanied by three separate hundis dated May 25, 1946 for Rs. 25,000, Rs. 12,500 and Rs. 12,500 drawn by Narayandas in favour of the Company. The meeting of May 25, 1946 was attended by three directors, Murlidhar Loya, D. R. Nayak and Narayandas. At that meeting, the directors also sanctioned a loan of Rs. 60,000 to Ramnath. On May 28, 1946, Ramnath obtained from the Company the loan of Rs. 60,000 against his promissory note, and a separate loan account No. 1/18 was opened in his name in the books of the Company. The three hundis were honoured on May 29, 1946. The directors of the Company at a meeting held on June 8, 1946 resolved to give an overdraft of Rs. 40,000 to Ramnath. A separate overdraft account L.A./C No. 71 in the name of Ramnath was opened in the books of the Company, and Ramnath obtained the sanctioned overdraft by a cheque dated June 27, 1946 for Rs. 15,000/ and another cheque dated June 29, 1946 for Rs. 25,000. The balance of the application and allotment moneys amounting to Rs. 12,500, Rs. 12,500 and Rs. 25,000 in respect of the shares of Goverjabai, Kamalabai and Jivanbai were paid to the Company on June 22, June 28 and June 29 respectively. There is reason to believe that the subscription of the 2000 shares was financed by the advances to Ramnath. On December 28, 1948, Ramnath was indebted to the Company in his loan account for Rs. 65,743 6 6 and in his overdraft account for Rs. 41,909 10 0. On that date, both accounts were closed, and a new loan account No. 9 with a debit of Rs. 1,09,500/ was opened in the name of Ramnath, who executed a promissory note. The Reserve Bank of India was pressing the Company to take steps in respect of the advances to Ramnath. In these circumstances, Ramnath repaid to the Company Rs. 18,500/ on December 29, 1950 and Rs. 1,500/ on January 2, 1951. At the same time, on January 6, 1951, the Company gave a new loan of Rs. 20,000/ to Ramkisan Ramratan Somani and Ramnath, and the borrowers executed a joint and several promissory note in favour of the Company for the sum of Rs. 20,000/ . In respect of this loan, a separate loan account was opened in the books of the Company. In his loan account No. 9, Ramnath repaid Rs. 1,00,000/ on December 27, 1951 and Rs. 4,198 8 0 on December 29, 1951, and as a result of the last payment, the account was closed. The above sum of Rs. 1,00,000/ was paid on behalf of Ramnath by Narayandas, who on the same date obtained a loan of Rs. 1,00,000/ from the Company. On the same date, Narayandas executed a promissory note for the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/ , a letter of pledge and trust receipt in respect of cloth, saris etc., valued at Rs. 1,50,000/ , and a separate loan account No. 6/184 in his name was opened in the books of the Company. In spite of demands, the Company was unable to realise its dues in respect of the outstanding loans. On March 18, 1954, the Company instituted Special Suit No. 39 of 1954 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division of Poona, against Ramkisan Ramratan Somani and Ramnath for the recovery of Rs. 22,964 13 0 due from them in respect of their loan account and the promissory note dated January 6, 1951. The suit was dismissed by the trial Court on April 23, 1955, but in First Appeal No. 819 of 1955 preferred by the Company, the High Court decreed the suit. Civil Appeal No. 801 of 1962 arises out of this claim. On April 24, 1954, the Company instituted Special Suit No. 78 of 1954 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Poona against Narayandas for the recovery of Rs. 1,09,099 14 4 due from him in respect of the loan account No. 6/184 and the promissory note dated December 27, 1951. On April 23, 1955, the trial Court dismissed the suit, but in First Appeal No. 820 of 1955 preferred by the Company, the High Court decreed the suit. Civil Appeal No. 802 of 1962 arises out of this claim. On behalf of the appellants, Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas contended that the allotment of the 2000 shares and the several loans in the names of Ramnath and Narayandas were not genuine transactions, and that the parties did not intend that the allottees would be the holders of the shares or that Narayandas and Ramnath would be liable to repay the loans. It is to be noticed that the plea that the allotment of the 2000 shares was not intended to be operative was not sufficiently raised in the pleadings. Narayandas pleaded in his written statement that at the time of the purchase of the shares, Loya and Parulekar gave him and Ramnath the assurance that the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/ required for the purchase of the shares would be paid by the Company on interest at 4½ per cent per annum and Loya and Parulekar would not demand and recover the amount but they would sell the shares and credit the amount of the sale proceeds towards the principal and interest in the loan account and would not allow Narayandas and Ramnath to suffer loss with regard thereto. Narayandas swore that it was agreed between him, Parulekar and Loya that he would nominally take the 2000 shares which would be finally sold to others and he would be out of liability and he and Ramnath would not repay the loans nor take any benefit thereunder. He also suggested that he or Ramnath did not repay any moneys out of their own pocket, and all repayments in the accounts were made out of the moneys received by him from the Company. At the trial, the Company did not examine either Loya or Parulekar. It may be that Loya and Parulekar gave some understanding to Narayandas with regard to the disposal of the shares, and in view of this understanding, they subsequently executed in favour of Narayandas two letters dated December 27, 1951, whereby Parulekar agreed to buy from him 500 shares and Loya agreed to buy from him 800 shares. But these assurances, if any, were given to Narayandas by Parulekar and Loya in their individual capacity and not as directors of the Company. There is no record of any assurance given on behalf of the Company to Narayandas in the minutes of the board meetings. Narayandas and his nominees, Goverjabai, Kamalabai and Jivanbai dealt with the shares on the footing that they were the owners of the shares, some of the shares were transferred to third parties under transfer deeds executed by Jivanbai, and the sale proceeds were credited to the loan account of Narayandas. Jivanbai received from the Company all the 1000 shares allotted to her and executed a receipt dated February 25, 1953. Narayandas obtained from Loya and Parulekar written undertakings dated December 27, 1951 for the purchase of 800 and 500 shares respectively. By letter dated June 28, 1954, Narayandas called upon Parulekar to fulfil his undertaking for the purchase of 500 shares. All these circumstances prove that the allotment of the 2000 shares was intended to be operative and the allottees were intended to be the holders of the shares. Ramnath out of his own funds paid several sums of money towards discharge of his indebtedness in the loan accounts. He paid Rs. 750 4 0 in the overdraft account towards interest on December 12, 1946 and Rs. 1,484 7 0 in the loan account No. 1/18 on April 21, 1947, and we are not satisfied that these sums were paid out of commission earned by Narayandas from the Company. Similarly, on December 29, 1951, he paid Rs. 4,198 8 0 in the loan account No. 9 and on January 4, 1954, Rs. 100/ was paid by Ramkisan Ramratan and Ramnath in their loan account. The loan accounts were secured by promissory notes. Moreover, the loan account of Narayandas was secured by a trust receipt and a letter of pledge. Even on March 3, 1953, Narayandas executed a letter in favour of the Company declaring that he held as security a stock of sarees valued at Rs. 1,50,000/ . In respect of other loan transactions, the Company charged the appellants interest at the rate of 6 per cent and those loans were repaid quickly. But the loan transactions in suit were intended to be of a more permanent nature, and in order to accommodate Narayandas and Ramnath, the Company agreed to charge interest at 4½ per cent. We are satisfied that the allotment of the 2000 shares was intended to be operative and the allottees became the owners of the shares. We are also satisfied that the loans to Ramnath and Narayandas were intended to be operative, and the Company did not give any assurance to them that they would not be called upon to repay the loans. The next contention of Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas arises in this way. Article 126 of the articles of association of the Company provides that the directors may determine the quorum necessary for the transaction of business, and unless and until otherwise determined, three directors shall be the quorum. The directors did not make any other determination with regard to quorum, and at all material times, a quorum of three was required for a directors ' meeting. The board meeting of May 25, 1946 was attended by three directors only, namely, M. C. Loya, D. R. Nayak and Narayandas. At this meeting, the directors resolved to allot 2000 shares to the nominees of Narayandas. Narayandas was clearly interested in the allotment of the shares. Section 91B(1) of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 provided that 'No director shall, as a director, vote on any contract or arrangement in which he is either directly or indirectly concerned or interested nor shall his presence count for the purpose of forming a quorum at the time of any such vote; and if he does so vote, the vote shall not be counted'. The Poona Bank, Ltd. was a public company, and section 91B(1) applied to its directors. Narayandas, therefore, ought not to have voted at the meeting of May 25, 1946. If his vote is excluded, there was no quorum for the meeting. Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas, therefore, contended that the allotment of 2000 shares to the nominees of Narayandas at this meeting was invalid and no title passed to the allottees in respect of the shares, and in the circumstances, there was a total failure of the consideration paid for the shares, and as the consideration was paid out of the loans, the appellants are not liable to repay the same. Now, a director of a company stands in a fiduciary position towards the company and is bound to protect its interests. For long, it has been an established rule of equity that he must not place himself in a position in which his personal interest conflicts with his duty, and unless authorised by the company 's articles, he must not vote as a director on any contract or arrangement in which he is directly or indirectly interested. Standard articles give effect to this rule of equity. See Palmer 's Company Precedents, 17th Edn, Part I, p. 553. If he votes in such a case, his vote would not be counted, and his presence would not count towards the quorum, that is to say, the minimum number fixed for the transaction of business by a board meeting, for a quorum must be a disinterested quorum, and must be comprised of directors who are entitled to vote on the particular matter before the meeting. See In re Yuill vs Greymouth Point Elizabeth Railway and Coal Company, Limited. If an interested director votes and without his vote being counted there is no quorum, the meeting is irregular, and the contract sanctioned at the meeting is voidable by the company against the director and any other contracting party who has notice of the irregularity, see Transvaal Lands Company vs New Belgium (Transvaal) Land and Development Company; but the company may waive the irregularity and affirm the transaction. The matter is put succinctly by Gore Browne in Handbook on Joint Stock Companies, 41st Edn., p. 363 thus: 'According to the well established rule that an agent can not act on behalf of his principal in a matter in which the agent has a conflicting interest or duty, directors are precluded from taking part in any resolution under which they take a benefit or which adopts a contract that concerns them unless the Articles authorises their doing so. It must be here noted that if interested directors take part in any transaction there is an irregularity which renders the transaction voidable by the company as against the directors and any persons who have knowledge of the facts'. Section 91B embodied the existing rule of equity in the form of a statutory provision. In Pratt (Bombay) Ltd. vs M.T. Ltd. and Sassoon & Co. Ltd. vs Pratt (Bombay) Ltd., Sir George Rankin observed that the section is a concise statement of the general rule of equity explained in the Transvaal Lands Company 's case, and he pointed out that the impugned transactions on which the interested directors had voted, were voidable by the official liquidator of the company. The voting by the interested director, of itself, does not invalidate the contract. The effect of section 91B is that the vote of the interested director must be excluded, and if as a result of such exclusion there is no quorum, the resolution sanctioning the contract is irregular and the contract is liable to be avoided by the company against the directors and any other contracting party having notice of the irregularity. Section 91B is meant for the protection of the company, and the company may, if it chooses, waive the irregularity and affirm the contract. We think that the allotment of the 2000 shares to the nominees of Narayandas in the meeting of the directors of the company held on May 25, 1946 was not void. In view of the fact that Narayandas was not entitled to vote on the allotment and after exclusion of his vote there was no quorum, the allotment was irregular, and the Company was entitled to avoid the allotment. Instead of avoiding the allotment, the Company has chosen to affirm it. The allotment is, therefore, valid and binding on the allottees. Moreover, Narayandas cannot be heard to say that there was no valid allotment of the shares. For the purpose of satisfying the requirement of section 277(1) it was necessary to allot the shares, and he allowed the Company to commence business on the footing that the shares had been subscribed. He was a director of the Company and a party to the resolution allotting the shares. He dealt with the shares on the footing that the allottees were the holders of the shares with a clear knowledge of the circumstances on which he might have founded his present objection. He cannot now be heard to say that he was interested in the allotment and could not vote. Like the director in York Tramways Company vs Willows, he is now estopped from contending that the allotment is invalid. For all these reasons, we hold that the allotment is valid, and there is no failure of consideration. In the plaint in Suit No. 78 of 1954, the Company pleaded that, on December 27, 1951 Narayandas took from it on loan a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/ and executed an on demand promissory note for the amount. Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas contended that, as a matter of fact, no cash amount was paid and no loan was advanced by the Company to Narayandas on December 27, 1951, and consequently, the suit as framed is not maintainable. Now, at the relevant time, Ramnath was indebted to the Company for Rs. 1,04,198/ in respect of loan account No. 9. On December 27, 1951, at the request of Narayandas, the Company credited Ramnath with Rs. 1,00,000/ in his loan account and debited Narayandas with Rs. 1,00,000/ in a new loan account opened in his name. On the same date, Narayandas acknowledged in writing the receipt of Rs. 1,00,000/ and executed a promissory note for the amount in favour of the Company. Ramnath took full advantage of the credit of Rs. 1,00,000/ and on payment of the balance of Rs. 4,198 8 0 closed his loan account No. 9. Though no actual money passed, the two entries in the books of account amounted to payment of Rs. 1,00,000/ by the Company to Narayandas by way of a loan and repayment of the same amount by Narayandas to the Company towards discharge of the indebtedness of Ramnath in the latter 's loan account with the Company. The result was as if the Company had paid a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/ in cash to Narayandas and then Narayandas had returned the amount to the Company with instructions to credit it to Ramnath. To support a plea of payment, it is not necessary to show that cash passed. Illustration (a) to section 50 of the Indian Contract Act shows that payment may be made by means of transfer entries in books of account. The Company has sufficiently established a payment of Rs. 1,00,000/ by it to Narayandas by way of loan on December 27, 1951. Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas contended that the loans to Narayandas and Ramnath were financial assistance by the Company for the purpose of or in connection with the purchase of its shares by Narayandas or his nominees, and the loans being in contravention of section 54A(2) of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 were illegal and could not be recovered. Mr. K.N. Bhabha contended (1) that the appellants ought not to be allowed to take this new point in this appeal; (2) the lending of the money was a part of the ordinary business of a banking company and the loans to Ramnath and Narayandas were made by the Company in the course of its business; and (3) having regard to the decision in Re V.G.M. Holdings, Ltd, the word 'purchase' in section 54A(2) did not include the acquisition of shares by subscription or allotment, and in this case, the loans were given in connection with the acquisition by Narayandas or his nominees of shares by subscription or allotment and not in connection with acquisition of shares by purchase, and consequently, section 54A(2) had no application. Now, it appears that in paragraph 15 of his written statement Narayandas pleaded that the advance of loans to him in connection with the purchase of shares was illegal, but no issue was raised on the question whether the loans were financial assistance in connection with the purchase of the shares and were in contravention of section 54A(2). There is a passing reference to this contention in paragraph 15 of the judgment of the trial Court, but there is no reference to it in the judgment of the High Court. We find also that this contention finds no place in the statement of the case filed on behalf of the appellants. Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas relied on ground No. 12 of the appellants’ statement of case, but, we think that this ground is wholly insufficient to raise this contention. In these circumstances, we think that it is not open to the appellants to urge this contention, and we indicated this to Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas in the course of the argument. In the Courts below, the appellants contended that Kamalabai was a minor, and, therefore, the allotment of 1000 shares to her was invalid. This contention is no longer pressed, and does not survive. No other contentions were advanced before us. In the result, the appeals are dismissed with costs, one hearing fee. Appeals dismissed.",

                "judgement": "Appeal No. 2296 of 1970. On appeal by Certificate from the Judgment and Decree dated 17th August, 1963 of the High Court of Patna from Original Decree No 248 of 1955 D. Goburdhan for the Appellant J. P. Goyal and R. A. Gupta for the Respondents The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J. This appeal by certificate under Article 133 (1) (a) of the Constitution arises out of an action in tort for damages 531 for trespass and unauthorised interference by the defendants with the A proprietary interest of the plaintiff. The defendants were the State of Bihar and J.P. Mukherjee, an officer in the service of the Bihar Government. The plaintiff, Prithwi Chand Lall Choudhary was the karta of a Hindu joint family which owned extensive properties collectively known as the 'Raj Nazarganj'. The said properties were spread over the District of Purnea and some other districts in the State of Bihar as also in the State of West Bengal. The plaintiff was the recorded proprietor of several tauzis situated in the Districts of Purnea and Monghyr and also the proprietor of several tenures and patnis within the said Districts. The plaintiff was liable to pay about Rs. 2,50,000 by way of taxes, cesses etc. annually. In the year 1949, the Bihar Legislature passed a law known as the Bihar State Management of Estates and Tenures Act, 1949 (Bihar Act XXI of 1949) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act ') to provide for the management of estates and tenures in the Province of Bihar. It received the assent of the Governor General on September 29, 1949 and was published in the Bihar Gazette Extraordinary of October 17, 1919. On the coming into force of the Constitution of January 26, 1950, the Act was certified by the President in exercise of his powers conferred by Article 31 (6) of the Constitution. The said certificate which was published in Notification No. 43/3/50 Judicial dated March 11, 1950 read as follows: 'that the said Act shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) of Article 31, or has contravened the provisions of sub section (2) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935.' Clauses (2) and (6) of Article 31 which are relevant for these cases as they stood at the commencement of the Constitution read as follows: '31. (1) (2) No property, moveable or immovable, including any interest in, or in any company owning, any commercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken possession of or 532 acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition, unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined and given. . . . . . (6) Any law of the State enacted not more than eighteen months before the commencement of this Constitution may within three months from such commencement be submitted to the President for his certification; and thereupon, if the President by public notification so certifies, it shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) of this article or has contravened the provisions of sub section (2) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935.' A persual of the provisions of the Act shows that it was intended to bring about a reform in the land distribution system of Bihar for the general benefit of the community. l`he taking over of the management and control over land was found to be necessary as a preliminary step towards the implementation of the Directive Principles of State Policy. The Act was similar in nature to the Bihar Land Reforms Act (Act XXX of 1950), the constitutional validity of which was considered by this Court in The State of Bihar v Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbanga Ors (1) The object of the Act was to bring the Government face to face with the cultivators of the soil in order to facilitate the further reform of abolition of zamindari. It was also intended to make provision for better irrigation facilities and to prevent realisation of excessive rent or revenue from the cultivators. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act published in the Bihar Gazette said: 'For some years past there has been wide spread anti zamindari agitation amongst the cultivators of the province leading to frequent agrarian troubles. These troubles, as is well known, owe their origin to the feeling of dissatisfaction that the tenants have against the landlords owing to the (1) 533 latter 's failure to provide for the upkeep of irrigational facilities, to the realisation of abwab, to the enhancement of rents and to ejectment from holdings and other similar causes. The landlord 's apathy towards the upkeep of the irrigational facilities has been considerably accentuated recently on account of the large scale commutation of rents in kind into cash rents. In the interest of all concerned and particularly in order to further the programme of Grow More Food, it has become necessary to assume the management by Government of estates and tenures. Hence this Bill. It is proposed under Government management to make adequate arrangements for saving the cultivators from the harassment to which they are often subjected at present by the amlas of the zamindars, to save them from the ruinous financial drain of litigation for the recovery of arrears of rents and above all to benefit them by providing for irrigation facilities. After making payment for objects specified in the Bill and reserving a reasonable balance for cost of management, the net surplus will be paid over to the proprietors.' Section 3 to 5 c f the Act were in Chapter 11 of the Act. Section 3 provided as follows : '3. (1) The Provincial Government may, by notification declare that the estates or tenures of a proprietor or tenure holder, specified in the notification, shall be placed under the management of the Provincial Government, and on the publication of the said notification, the estates or tenures of such proprietor or tenure holder shall, so long as the notification remains in force, be deemed to have been placed under the management of the Provincial Government with effect from the date of the commencement of management. (2) The notification under sub section (1) shall (a) specify such particulars of the estates or tenures as may be prescribed; (b) specify the period for which the estates or tenures shall be placed under the management of the Provincial Government; and 534 (c) vest the management of such estates or tenures in a person who shall be an officer not below the rank of Deputy Collector (hereinafter called the Manager) (3) The notification under sub section (1) shall be published in the Official Gazette and a copy of such notification shall be sent by registered post, with an acknowledgment due, to the proprietor of the estates recorded in the general registers of revenue paying or revenue free lands maintained under the Land Registration Act, 1876, or in case such estates are not recorded in any such registers, and in the case of tenure holders, to the proprietor or tenure holder of the estates or tenures, as the case may be, if the Collector of the district is in possession of a list of Such proprietors or tenure holders together with their addresses (4) The publication and posting of such notification, where such notification is sent by post, in the manner provided in sub section (3), shall be conclusive evidence of the notice of the declaration to the proprietor or tenure holder whose estates or tenures are affected by the notification under sub section (1) and of the service of such notice on the proprietor or tenure holder 7 ' Section 4 of the Act laid down the consequences of the issue of a notification in respect of any estate or tenure. It provided inter alia that (a) the proprietor or tenure holder shall cease to have any power of management of his estates or tenures and (b) subject to the provisions of sections 7, 8, 9, 10. 11 and 12, the Manager shall take charge of such estates or tenures together with such buildings, papers and other properties appertaining to the estates or tenures, as in the opinion of the Manager are essential for the proper management of the estates or tenures. Section 5 of the Act read as follows: '5. The Manager may, by a written order, require the proprietor or tenure holder or his agents and employees on a date to be specified in such order to produce before him such documents, papers or registers relating to the estates or tenures of such proprietor or tenure holder or to furnish him with such information as the Manager may deem necessary for the management of the estates or tenures: 535 Provided that the proprietor or tenure holder shall have A the option to comply with such written order either himself or through authorised agent.' Chapter III of the Act contained the special provisions regarding trust estates or tenures, homesteads and lands used for agricultural and horticultural purposes and certain buildings comprised in estates or tenures placed under the management of the Provincial Government. Chapter IV of the Act authorised the removal of mortgagees and lessees in possession of an estate or tenure. Chapter V contained provisions regarding the filing of claims by secured creditors and other persons in possession of the estate or tenure, determination of liabilities and preparation of scheme for their liquidation. Chapter VI of the Act provided for the filing of claims by creditors other than secured creditors. Chapter VII made provisions for granting protection from sale of certain estates. Chapter VIII of the Act contained detailed provisions regarding the management of the estates by the Manager. Section 22 of the Act which was in Chapter VIII provided that 'every Manager shall manage the property committed to him diligently and faithfully and shall, in every respect, act to the best of his judgment '. Chapter IX of the Act provided for an appeal to the order of prescribed authority against the Manager. Chapter X made provision for the constitution of Estates and Tenures Management Advisory Committee and their functions. Sections 30 and 31 of the Act which were in Chapter XI of the Act barred the jurisdiction of courts regarding matters referred to therein. They read as under: '30. Notwithstanding anything contained in any law or anything having the force of law, the declaration of the Provincial Government under sub section (1) of section 3 and the order of the Manager under sub section (1) of section 13 or where on appeal has been preferred, the order of the appellate authority under section 27, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be final and shall not be questioned in any Court; and so long as the management of the estates and tenures by the Provincial Government continues, it shall not be lawful for any court to pass any order or do anything which may in any way interfere or have the effect of interfering with such management by the Provincial Government. No suit or other legal proceeding shall lie in any court against the Crown or any servant of the Crown or 536 against any person acting under the orders of a servant of the Crown for, or on account of, or in respect of, anything done or purporting to be done in good faith under this Act or in respect of any alleged neglect or omission to perform any duty devolving on the Provincial Government or any of the officers subordinate to it and acting under this Act or in respect of the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any power conferred by this Act, on the Provincial Government or any officer subordinate to it and acting under this Act, except for the loss or the misapplication occasioned by the wilful default or gross negligence of any officer of the Provincial Government.' Chapter XII of the Act contained some miscellaneous provisions regarding suits and appeals by or against the proprietor or tenure holder during the period of management by the Government. Section 33 in Chapter XIII of the Act provided for relinquishment of management of an estate taken over by the Government and other consequential matters. The other parts of the Act contained provisions regarding other miscellaneous matters. By a notification dated November 19, 1949 issued under section 3 (1) of the Act the estate of the plaintiff i.e. the 'Raj Nazarganj Estate ' was taken under the management of the State Government. J P Mukherjee, defendant No. 2, who was the Additional Collector of Darbhanga, was appointed as the Manager of the said estate. In the meanwhile the Maharajadhiraja of Darbhanga, Sir Kameshwar Singh filed a suit in the Civil Court challenging the validity of the Act as his estate also had been similarly notified under section 3 (1) of the Act. That suit was withdrawn by the Patna High Court being tried in its Extraordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. That suit was decided on June 5, 1950. The judgment of the High Court in that suit is reported as M.D. Sir Kameshwar Singh vs State of Bihar.(1) By that judgment the Patna High Court declared that the Act was ultra vires and wholly void and an injunction was issued restraining the State Government from enforcing the Act. Against that judgment, the State of Bihar preferred an appeal before this Court. But the plaintiff in the case before us, however, on the basis of the judgment of the High Court demanded on June 9, 1950 that he should be put back in possession of the estate whose management had been taken over from him. On July 3, 1950 the then Collector by his letter informed the plaintiff (1) I.L.R. '29 Patna 790. 537 that the Government had decided to relinquish charge of the estates A and tenures of the plaintiff and that the plaintiff should cooperate in taking over charge by July 15, 1950. On July 6, 1950 the Government had already cancelled the notification s issued under section 3 (1) of the Act. The charge of collection papers was handed by the middle of July, 1950. The abstracts and synopsis of accounts were given on August 7, 1950. About Rs. 1, 46,00' had been collected on behalf of the estate during the Government 's management. After the estate was thus handed over to him, the plaintiff filed a suit on September 21, 1951 in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Purnea for damages of Rs. 2,00,000 for wrongful and illegal interference with the plaintiff 's estates and tenures and for other consequential reliefs. The plaint proceeded on the basis that the Act was unconstitutional as declared by the High Court earlier and that taking over of the possession and management of the estate etc. was illegal. The plaintiff pleaded that the Act having been declared void, the defendants were liable for not only the amount of loss actually suffered by the plaintiff but were also liable to recoup the amount spent by them during their management of the estate which was wrongful. It was alleged that the action of the defendants suffered from negligence, bad faith and malice. The plaint claimed that the defendants were liable jointly and severally as tort feasors for all such losses suffered by him. In paragraph 27 of the plaint the plaintiff set out broadly the grounds of his claim thus: (a) that due to gross negligence and wilful default the defendants contravened the provisions of section 3 (1) in notifying and taking possession of part only of plaintiff interests in Estates and Tenures and in omitting to notify other parts of his Estates and Tenures on the first occasion when the notification dated November 19, 1949 was issued the Government was unable to realise all the rents and other dues, (b) that due to wrong notification and omission to notify all parts of his Estates and Tenures and also on account of amalgamated rentals maintained by the plaintiff in respect of his estates and tenures, the plaintiff could not fully realise the balance share of unnotified estates and tenures, (c) that certain rents and decrees had been allowed to become barred by time and (d) that on account of non payment of Agricultural Income Tax and consequent imposition of penalty which was no doubt reduced to Rs. 2,000 on appeal the Estate suffered a loss of Rs. 2,000 He also pleaded that on account of the issue of wrong collection certificates by defendant No. 2 and his staff the plaintiff had suffered some loss which was yet to be ascertained. 538 In the written statement the defendants traversed all the material allegations in the plaint. They pleaded inter alia that the notification was issued in November, 1949 on the basis of the requisition of the Collector, P.K.J. Menon and that defendant No. 2 was appointed as Manager by that notification. The allegations of negligence, bad faith and malice were denied. The defendants pleaded that on the basis of information available in the records of the Government the notification was issued in November, 1949 and at the request of the plaintiff after verification second notification was issued on March 16, 1950, and that plaintiff requested for the issue of the second notification in order to escape the processes of law which had been taken out against him by his creditors and to shield his entire properties from the creditors. In fact the Government appointed the very collecting agents who were working under the plaintiff and after the management was handed back he reappointed them as his collecting agents. The plaintiff had accepted without protest the final accounts which had been prepared at the end of the period of management. Tauzis Nos. 7/8, 30 and 38 about which there was some dispute remained all along with the plaintiff and the collection papers pertaining to them were made over to defendant No. 2 only in the latter part of April, 1950 and if no collection could be made prior thereto in the said area till then the defendants could not be blamed. The defendants pleaded that they had bona fide carried out their duties. One fact which requires to be noted here is that the plaint did not have any reference to the effect of section 31 of the Act which is set out above, but it proceeded on the basis that the Act was unconstitutional. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court held that the cost of management incurred by defendant No 2 over and above 12.1/2% of gross collection was excessive and the dependents should refund such excess amount. Secondly, it held that the mistake in not notifying all the shares held by the plaintiff in Tauzis Nos. 718 and 3 at the first instance resulted in non collection of the dues and the plaintiff thereby had suffered. The trial court held that the defendants being trespassers, the plaintiff owed no duty to them to make available to them the separated Jamabandi to facilitate collection of dues in the said Tauzis. The trial court, therefore, held that the defendants should reimburse the plaintiff the amount he would have been able to collect from those tauzis during the period of their management. Similarly, the defendants were liable to make good the loss caused on account of arrears or decrees which had been allowed to become barred. The trial court directed that a commissioner should enquire into the above items. Accordingly a preliminary decree was passed. 539 Against the said preliminary decree the defendants filed an appeal before the High Court. When the appeal came up before a Division bench of the High Court, the defendants contended that the decision of the High Court in which the Act had been declared as unconstitutional required to be reconsidered by the High Court in view of some later decisions of this Court. Accordingly the Division Bench referred the case to a larger Bench on July 14, 1962. The case was then heard by a Full Bench of five learned Judges of the Patna High Court. By its judgment dated February 15, 1963 the Full Bench overruled the earlier decision in MD. Sir Kameshwar Singh vs State of Bihar (supra) and declared that the Act was constitutional. The appeal was then referred back to the Division Bench for disposal in accordance with the opinion of the Full Bench. The Division Bench which finally heard the appeal was of the view that though it was open to the State to notify only a fraction of an estate under section 3 (1) of the Act yet the defendants were not absolved from the duty of taking appropriate steps for the preparation of suitable collection papers in respect of the notified shares in Tauzis Nos. 718 and 300. It held that the defendants were liable to compensate the plaintiff for not preparing the collection papers in time. The Division Bench further held that even though the plaintiff had been told to file suits for rents in respect of unnotified share of the estate, the defendants were negligent in the matter of issuing certificates for recovery, some of which were later on struck off. The Division Bench also held that the material on the record did not indicate that necessary steps were taken by defendant No. 2 with regard to pending suits and execution proceedings and there was every 17 probability that loss had been suffered by the plaintiff on account of the inaction or failure to continue pending proceedings which amounted to wilful default and gross negligence. The Division Bench agreed with the trial court that the defendants were liable to reimburse the plaintiff to the extent of Rs. 2,000 levied as penalty for non payment of Agricultural Income Tax. In so far as the cost of management of Rs. 43,507 which was in the order of 30 per cent of the gross collection was concerned while the trial court had allowed 12.112 per cent, the Division Bench allowed 25 per cent of the gross collection. In other words the Division bench found that about Rs. 8,000 had been incurred as cost of management in excess of what was authorised. The Division Bench found that the plaintiff was entitled to it. The Division Bench held that section 31 of the Act did not give protection in respect of loss which was caused by wilful 540 default and gross negligence. The appeal of the defendants was accordingly dismissed. The cross objections of the plaintiff regarding certain matters disallowed by the trial court were also dismissed Aggrieved by the decree passed by the High Court, the State of Bihar applied for a certificate under Article 133 (1) (a) of the Constitution in S.C.A. No. 137/63 on the file of the High Court to file an appeal before this Court. On the HIGH Court granting the certificate accordingly on December 10,1961, the State of Bihar has filed the above appeal. The plaintiff also applied for a similar certificate in S.C.A No. 1/64 on the file of the High Court to file an appeal against the decree in so far as it had gone against him. The High Court granted in his case also a similar certificate by She same order on December 10,1964 but the said certificate was later on cancelled by the High Court on July 6, 1965. Thus the said proceedings came to an end. We are now concerned with only the appeal field by the State of Bihar. In this appeal, the constitutionality of the Act is not questioned before us. On going through the record of the case, we find that the following facts are established. The notification issued on November 19,1949 under section 3 (1) of the Act referred to the name of the proprietor, the name of the estate, tauzi numbers of the estate and the share of the proprietor in the tauzis. Defendant No. 2, J.P. Mukherjee who was then the Additional Collector of Purnea was appointed as the Manager of the estate. On December 14, 1949, the plaintiff was informed by the Collector at Purnea that the management of the estate was to commence from December 30, 1949 and that he should produce before the Manager a list of villages included in the estate and also the Jamabandis, Karchas and Wasil Baukis upto date before December 27,1949 and also to make over a complete and clear list of the papers showing Jamabandis of each village, the arrears collected and the arrears outstanding before the commencement of the management under the Act. He was requested to cooperate in the matter and was also informed that if he did not do so the responsibility for any loss would be his. On December 27, 1949 the plaintiff wrote a letter to the Collectorate. In that he stated that the work of handing over papers properly of a big and complicated estate was not an easy task and it would certainly take a considerable number of days to complete it. He pointed out that the Government had committed an error in taking over the management of only 2A 11A 2C 2K 541 share out of Tauzi No 7/8 under the notification, because the collection papers had been maintained for 5 12. 1 /2 and odd share in respect said of the said tauzi. He pleaded that unless the whole of 5 12.1/2 share was notified, the work of separation of the notified share from the notified share could not be completed even within a period of six months. He, therefore, asked for the modification of the notification. Then we find that the plaintiff had met the Collector many times when the affairs of the estate were discussed. On March I 1,195 ', the Collector wrote the following letter to the plaintiff: 'District Office, Purnea The 11th March. 1950 My dear Raja Saheb, 1. With reference to our discussions on the 7th March. 1950, the following action may be taken with regard to the notified and unnotified portions of your estate as agreed to between us. We will not be taking over the unnotified portion until the notification is made. As soon as a notification is made we will take over these portions. Meanwhile in order to see that no limitation occurs with regard to any rent payable to you, you are requested to prepare a copy of arrear list for the unnotified portions. With regard to Tauzi No. 7, sufficient number of Tahsildars and other staff required may be employed after selection on the 14th of March, 1950, at Kishanganj, by the Additional Collector and by your Circle Officer. A certain number of these, according to the proportion that is notified will be selected by the Additional Collector and paid by Government. You are requested to employ a certain number according to the proportion of the unnotified interest. These staff together may be put on the job of preparing the arrear list. If notification is made before the Tamadi Day, we will arrange to issue certificates in respect of arrears due. however, notification for some reason or other is not made, 542 then we will arrange to file joint suits for these arrears before the Tamds Day. Yours sincerely, sd/ (Illeg ) 13/3 Raja P.C. Lal Choudhuri, C.B.E. Nazarganj Palace, Purnea City. ' A supplementary notification was issued on March 16, 1950 as desired by the plaintiff. Then we find that there is some further discussion and correspondence between the plaintiff and the Manager. On April 7,1950, the Manager wrote to the plaintiff that he had been able to persuade the Government to advance Rs. 35,000 to meet the expenses of suits to be field for recovery of rents due to the estate. The plaintiff replied to that letter on the same date appreciating the step taken by the Government in advancing Rs. 35,000 as loan to the estate. On April 14,1950, the Manager sent a telegram to the plaintiff stating that since he had not cooperated in sending the previous records of cases in time in respect of Tauzi No. 7/8, it was not possible to file joint suits in respect of both the notified and unnotified share and that he was responsible for filing Tamadi suits in respect of the unnotified share in Tauzi No. 718. The defendant No. 2 in his evidence has stated that he could not make any collection in Tauzis Nos. 7/8 and 30 prior to the second notification because the collection papers were with the plaintiff and they were actually received by him on April 24,.1950. In the lengthy cross examination of defendant No. 2 we do not find any material which would discredit his evidence or which would show that he had either acted in excess of his powers or mala fide. We also find that a large number of suits had been filed for recovery of the arrears due to the estate and merely because some of the suits were dismissed on merits or on the ground that some of the persons sued were dead or not traceable, it cannot be said that there was lack of bona fides on the part of the Manager. By the middle of July, 1950, the management of the estate itself was relinquished. From the foregoing, we find that it could not be said that there was want of good faith on the part of either the Government or defendant No. 2 who was the Manager. If a certain share in a tauzi had not been notified on the first occasion it again cannot be said as having been done either mala fide or deliberately to harm the plaintiff. We shall now deal with the specific findings recorded by the Division Bench of the High Court. 543 The first ground on which the Division Bench has held that the A defendants were liable to pay damages is that defendant No. 2 had failed to get the collection papers prepared in respect of Tauzis Nos. 7/8 and 30 in time and thus caused loss to the plaintiff. it may be stated here that the Division Bench accepted and we think rightly in view of the definition of the expression 'tenure ' in section 5 of the Act that it was open to the Government to notify even a fraction of a tenure under section 3 (1) of the Act It, however, omitted to notice that the plaintiff had failed to discharge his duty imposed on him under section 5 of the Act which provided that the Manager could by a written order require the proprietor or tenure holder or his agents and employees on a date to be specified in such order to produce before him such documents or papers or registers relating to the estate or tenure concerned or to furnish him with such information as he may deem necessary for the management of the estate or tenure. In the present case defendant No. 2 did call upon the plaintiff to submit the documents from which it was possible to find out the ability of persons in respect of the notified share in Tauzis Nos. 718 and 30. The plaintiff pleaded that he had not maintained such separate set of ' accounts and that it would take a long time to prepare it. He, how ever, produced the registers by the end of April, 1950 only, after the remaining shares were also notified. Hence if the collection papers were not prepared till then by defendant No 2 in time it was not on account of any negligence on the part of defendant No. 2. On the other hand he recommended that the unnotified share also should be notified as desired by the plaintiff and such notification was also issued. By the time steps could be taken to prepare the collections papers the Act had been struck down by the High Court. Then steps were taken to hand over the estate back to the plaintiff. It is difficult to agree with the High Court that there was any wilful default or gross negligence on the part of defendant No. 2 in this regard. With regard to the charge that defendant No. 2 had filed a large number of certificate cases, some of which were later on struck off, the observation of the High Court itself supports that there was no negligence on the part of defendant No. 2 but on the other hand the plaintiff was responsible for it. The High Court has observed thus: 'It appears that it was on the basis of some arrears list submitted by the plaintiff of defendant No. 2 and without subjecting it to proper scrutiny, that a large number of certificate cases were hurriedly filed by the defendants at the time of the Tamadi in the middle of April 1950, and, it was. 544 therefore, not strange that quite a large number of them had subsequently to be struck off, with the result that a considerable portion of the arrears of rents and profits of the plaintiff 's estate remained unrealised and became time barred. It is manifest that the loss caused to the plaintiff 's estate on this account was due to the inaction of defendant No. 2 amounting to wilful default and gross negligence on his part. The responsibility for such loss must undoubtedly lie with the defendants.' (underlining by us) The High Court omitted to notice that the certificate cases had been filed though hurriedly on the basis of the arrears list submitted by the plaintiff, himself. In the circumstances it is difficult to charge defendant No. 2 with wilful default or gross negligence on a complaint by the plaintiff. Further the High Court did not refer in the course of its judgment at least to a few such cases which showed that there was gross negligence. The High Court overlooked that nearly 7,000 certificate cases had to he filed in a short period. On the material before us we are not satisfied that the above ground has been made out against the defendants. The third ground that defendant No. 2 had not diligently attended to any pending proceeding is also not made out since no specific case is dealt with by the High Court which prima facie established that charge. With regard to the penalty of Rs. 2,000 imposed for non payment of the Agricultural Income Tax it is seen that a penalty of Rs. 5,000 was first imposed as the plaintiff was unable to pay the Agricultural Income Tax in time because he could not collect arrears in time. In fact on the intervention of the Collector it was reduced to Rs. 2,000. Even then it was too remote to the management of the notified estate by defendant No. 2. The trial court had held that it was due to the issue of a wrong notification at the first instance. But when once it is conceded that the first notification was not an unauthorised one the defendants could not be held liable for reimbursing the penalty of Rs 2,000 paid by the plaintiff. In so far as the cost of management is concerned, the dispute is confined to about Rs. 8000. It is seen that the estate had to be returned prematurely to the plaintiff Owing to the judgment of the High 545 Court declaring the Act as unconstitutional within a period of about seven months. But since defendant No. 2 had offered to refund any expenditure incurred in excess of 25% of the gross collections to the plaintiff, defendant No. I has to pay back Rs. 8,000 to the plaintiff. It is seen that in present case while the trial court proceeded on the basis that the Act was unconstitutional that the defendants were trespassers on the plaintiff 's estate and that the plaintiff owed no duty to them, the Division Bench of the High Court which finally disposed of the appeal failed to give due attention to section 31 of the Act which had been held to be constitutional earlier. Section 31 of the Act provided that no suit or other legal proceeding would lie in any court against the State Government or against any servant of the State Government or against any person acting under the orders of a servant of the State Government for or on account of or in respect of anything done or purporting to he done in good faith under the Act or in respect of any alleged neglect or omission to perform any duty devolving on the State Government or any of the officers subordinate to it or acting under the Act or in respect of the exercise of or on failure to exercise any power conferred by the Act on the State Government or any officer subordinate to it and acting under the Act, except for the loss or the misapplication occasioned by the wilful default or gross negligence of any officer of the State Government. Under section 4 (22) of the Bihar and Orissa General Clauses Act, 1917, a thing shall be deemed to be done in 'good faith ' where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not. There is no ground to hold that either the State Government or any of the officers acting under it in performance of their duties under the Act had not acted honestly either in issuing the notification under section 3 (l) of the Act on November 19,1949 by which only parts of Tauzis No. 7/8 and 30 had been notified or in not preparing separate collection statements before April, 1950. the mistake appears to have occurred because the plaintiff himself had acquired the said Tauzis in installments. Further as soon as the error was pointed out steps were taken by defendant No. 2 to get the unnotified share also notified and the Government issued a notification accordingly within about four months. It is b cause the plaintiff did not hand over even the consolidated collection statements by April, l950, the separate collection statements could not be got prepared by defendant No. 2 by April, 1950 and even according to the plaintiff himself it would have taken six months to prepare separate collection statements on the basis of the consolidated statements. It is not shown that either the State Government or any of its officers knew before hand that the plaintiff 546 had maintained a consolidated statement of accounts and that deliberately in order to cause loss to the plaintiff the first notification had been issued in respect of a portion of Tauzis Nos. 7/8 and 30. These facts constituted a good defence under Section 31 of the Act against any claim based on any alleged neglect or omission since there was no proof of any wilful default or gross negligence on the part of the defendants. There was also no proof of deliberate abuse of statutory power nor of usurpation of a power which the authorities knew that they did not possess. In the circumstances the claim for damages on all counts should fail except with regard to the claim for Rs. 8,000 which had been incurred as cost of management in excess of what was authorised by law. For the foregoing reasons, we set aside the judgment and decree by the trial court and the judgment and decree dated August 17, 1963 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and pass a decree against defendant No. 1, the State of Bihar directing it to pay the plaintiff 's legal representatives a sum of Rs. 8,000/ with interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum from the date of suit i.e. September 21, 1951 till the date of payment. The rest of the claim in the suit is dismissed. Parties shall bear their own costs in all the courts. The appeal is accordingly allowed in part. S.R. Appeal allowed.",

            "judgement": "Civil Appeal Nos. 1339 40 of 1988. From the judgment dated 7.7.1987 of the Madras High Court in W.P. Nos. 9781 and 10545 of 1986. G.L. Sanghi, P.P. Rao, R. Mohan, R. Perumal, V. Krishna murthy, M.N. Krishnamani, V. Sekhar, K.V. Vishwanathan, T. Raja, S.R. Setia, P. Chaudhary, A. Mariarputham and M.A. Krishnamurthy for the appearing parties. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J. In these appeals by special leave, the legality of the judgment of the Madras High Court dated 7 July 1987 quashing the promotions made to the cadre of professors in law colleges in the State of Tamil Nadu has been called into question. The appeals arise in the following circumstances: During the period from 1971 to 1982 the Government appointed temporary junior professors in different law colleges in the State. The appointments were made under Rule 10(a)(i)(1) of the Tamil Nadu State and SubOrdinate Services Rules, 1955 (Viz. Preliminary and The General Rules) (hereinafter called 'the Rules '). In 1979 the State Public Service Commission invited applications for regular appointment of junior professors. The temporary junior professors and others applied for the posts. The Public Service Commission selected 25 candidates out of whom 21 were already working as temporary junior professors. The selected candidates were arranged in the list called 'approved list '. ' in the order of merit. The list was prepared by the Public Service Commission on 16 August 1983. It was approved by the Government 'on 9 December 1983. On 27 June 1985 the State Government made an order regularising the services of those 21 junior professors. Their services were regularised with effect from the dates of original appointments as temporary junior professors. On 10 September 1986 some of the junior professors were promoted and appointed as professors in the law colleges. promotion was challenged before the Madras High Court on the ground that the claim of the seniors has been over looked ' It, was urged before the High Court that once the temporary services have been regularised retrospectively with effect from the date of entry in the service, the seniority should be reckoned by giving the benefit of regularised service 621 notwithstanding the ranking in the approved list prepared by the Public Service Commission. The High Court accepted that plea and queshed the promotion of professors and directed the Government to make a proper order of promotion in the light of the views expressed in the judgment. The correctness of the judgment of the High Court has been assailed in these appeals. We must first outline the necessary statutory provisions bearing on the question raised. Section 10(a)(i)(1) provides as follows: '10. Temporary appointments: (a)(i)(1) Where it is necessary in the public interest owing to an emergency which has arisen to fill immediately a vacancy in a post borne on the cadre of a service, class or category and there would be undue delay in making such appointment in accordance with these rules and the Special Rules, the appointing authority may temporarily appoint a person, otherwise than in accordance with the said rules. Rule 22 so far as relevant reads: 'Reservation of Appointments Where the Special Rules lay down that the principle of reservation of appointments shall apply to any service, class or category, selection for appointment thereto shall with effect on and from the 7th June 197.1, in cases such selection is made by the Commission, and 8th November 1971, in other cases, be made on the following basis (a) The unit of selection for appointment, for the purpose of this rule, shall be one hundred, of which ,eighteen shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and thirty one shall be reserved for the Backward Classes and the remaining fifty one shall be filled on the basis of merit. (b) The claims Of members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the Backward Classes shall also be considered for the fifty one appointments, which shall be filled on the basis of merit; and where a candidate 622 belonging to a Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or Back ' ward Class is selected on the basis of merit, the number of posts reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes or for the BackWard Classes, as the case may be, shall not in any way be affected. Rule 23, so far. as material, is as follows: '23(a)(i) Date of Commencement of probation of persons first appointment temporarily If a person appointed temporarily either under sub rule (a) or sub rule. (d) of rule 10 to fill a vacancy in any service, class or category otherwise than in accordance with the rules governing appointment thereto, such vacancy being a vacancy which may be filled by direct recruitment, is subsequently appointed to the service, class or category in accordance with the rules, he shall commence his probation; if any, in such category either from the date of his first temporary appointment or from such subsequent date, as the appointing authority may determine. Provided that on the date so determined, the person possesses all the qualifications prescribed for appointment to the service, class or category, as the case may be. (ii) A person who commences probation under clause (i) shall also be eligible to draw increments in the time scale of pay applicable to him from the date of commencement of his probation. Where commencement of probation is ordered from a date earlier than the date of the order and if this has not been enabled by relaxation of any rule, he shall draw increments, including arrears, in the time scale Of pay applicable to him from such earlier date. The appointing authority shall include a provision to this effect while issuing orders in all such cases. Rule 35 omitting immaterial words, is in these terms: '35(a) The seniority of a person in a service, class or cate 623 gory or grade shall unless he has been reduced to a lower rank as a punishment, be determined by the rank obtained by him in the list of approved candidates drawn up by the T.N.P.S.C. or other appointing authority, as the case may be, subject to the rule of reservation. where it applies. The date of commencement of his probation shall be the date on which he joins duty irrespective of his seniority. ', It is under these Rules the Public Service Commission invited applications for selecting candidates for direct recruitment to the cadre of Assistant professors in Law. The Public Service Commission prepared the list of selected candidates by following the reservation provided under rule 22. The list was approved by the State Government. ' Rule 35(a) states that seniority of a person ' be determined by the rank 'obtained by him in the list of approved candidates drawn by the Public Service Commission subject to rule of reservation where it applies. The contention urged for the respondents, is. that since their temporary service as junior professors were regularised, the regularised service should count for the purpose of determining, their seniority and not the rankings in the select ,list approved by the Government. We find little substance in it. The order of regularisation is in these terms: 'ORDER DATED 27.6.1985 In G.O Ms. No. 2288 Education dated 9.12.1983 the Government approved the selection made by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission of the 25 candidates mentioned therein for appointment by direct recruitment as Junior Professor in the Tamil Nadu Legal Educational Service These 25 candidates were appointed temporarily as from their taking charge 'in G.O. Ms. No. 897 Education dated 11.7. The Government have however, decided to appoint them, regularly with effect from, the dates on which, they were declared fully qualified to hold the post of Junior professor in the Law Colleges in Tamil Nadu prior to their selection by the Tamil. Public. Service. Commission and appointment as Junior ,Professors,in Law Colleges with reference to their selection. The Government accordingly direct that the services of the 21 individuals mentioned in the Annexure to this order as Junior Professors in the Tamil Nadu Legal Educational Service, be regularised with retrospective effect from the dates noted against them. The inter se seniority of the 21 candidates indicated in the annexure is in accordance with the seniority fixed by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission. The inter se seniority position will not be affected in any way with reference to the dates of regularisation mentioned in column 3 of the annexure. Under Rule 23(a)(ii) of the General Rules for State and Subordinate Services, the incumbents are eligible for increments from the date of their regularisation as they are fully qualified to hold the post on that date. The increments already sanctioned to them, for their services as temporary junior professors prior to regular appointment, is ratified. The first paragraph of the order refers to the selection of 25 candidates by the Public Service Commission for appointment as Junior Professors in the law colleges and their appointment with effect from their taking charges. The second paragraph of the order deals with the regularisation of the services of/21 candidates out of 25 appointed. The Government directed that the services of the 21 Junior Professors specified in the order be regularised with retrospective effect from the date noted against them. In the third paragraph it is stated that the inter se seniority of the 21 candidates is in accordance with the seniority fixed by the Public Service Commission and the inter se seniority position will not be affected in any way with reference to the dates of regularisation of their services. The paragraph four of the order deals with the rights of the candidates to draw increments under rule 23(a)(ii) in the service rendered as temporary Junior Professors. The High Court has stated that Rule 35(a) could not have been properly invoked by the State Government after the regularisation of the services of the candidates and it would be against the very concept of order of regularisation. It has been pointed out that by regularisation the period of temporary service has been converted into a period of regular service and a deeming fiction is introduced that the candidates whose services have been regularised retrospectively must be treated for all purposes as being in regular service from the respective dates of regularisation. In our opinion, the view expressed by the High Court not only runs counter to the terms of the order of the regularisation but also is inconsistent with Statutory principle of determining seniority under Rule 35(a). In the first place the order of regularisation of the services of the candidates expressly states that the inter se seniority of the candidates would be in accordance with the rankings in the approved list prepared by the Public Service Commission and will not be affected in any way by the date of regularisation of services. When the order of regularisation of temporary service itself denies such service for the purpose of determining seniority, the Court cannot count that service for the purpose of seniority. Secondly, Rule 35(a) provides for determining the inter se seniority of the candidates selected by the Public Service Commission. It states that the seniority of a person in a service, class or category or trade shall be determined unless he has been reduced to a lower rank as a punishment, by the rank obtained by him in the list of approved candidates drawn by the Public Service Commission or other appointing authority as the case may be. Since the parties in these cases appeared for selection before the Public Service Commission for regular recruitment as Junior Professors, the list of approved candidates prepared by the Public Service Commission in the order of merit and accepted by the Government should be the basis for determining their inter se seniority. It is not open to the parties to claim that their temporary service as Junior Professors upon regularisation should be counted for the purpose of determining the seniority in the cadre. There is no rule supporting such contention. The services rendered in the temporary post is available either for earning increments or for commencement of probation. That would be clear from Rule 23(a). Consistent with the Rule 23(a), the Government in the order of regularisation has directed that the incumbents are eligible for increments from the date of their regularisation as they are fully qualified to hold the post on that date. The increments already sanctioned to them during their services as temporary Junior Professors prior to regular appointment has been ratified by the said order. The High Court was plainly in error in ignoring the statutory Rules and the terms and conditions of the order of regularisation of services. Apart from that, Rule 10(a)(i)(1) provides for making of temporary appointments when it is necessary in the public interest to do so owing to an emergency which has arisen for filling a vacancy immediately. Such appointments are made otherwise than in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Rules. In the instant case the respondents were appointed temporarily and otherwise than in accordance with the Rules. They were later selected along with others for direct recruitment by the Public Service Commission. They were not entitled to count their temporary service for seniority. In A.P.M. Mayakutty etc, vs Secretary, Public Service Department etc., at 942 this Court observed that the services rendered by the applicants under Rule 10(a)(i)(1) cannot be considered for the purpose of seniority as such appointment is a matter of stop gap, emergency or fortuitous arrangement. The present case cannot be an exception to this principle even though their temporary services have been regularised, since regularisation was only for limited purposes. In any view of the matter the decision of the High Court cannot be sustained. In the result the appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment is set aside with no order as to costs. V.P.R. Appeals allowed.",

            "judgement": "Appeals Nos. 386 and 387 of 1966. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated April 16, 1963 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in First Appeal No. 217 of 1959. S. V. Gupte, P. C. Bhartari and J. B. Dadachanji, for the appellants (in C.A. No. 386 of 1966) and the respondents (in C.A. No. 387 of 1966). I. N. Shroff and Rama Gupta, for the State of Madhya Pradesh. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J. These appeals are brought by special leave from the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated 16th April, 1963 in First Appeal No. 217 of 1959, whereby the High Court modified partly the judgment of the first Additional District Judge, Jabalpur dismissing Civil Suit No. 10-A of 1954. The suit was instituted against the State of Madhya Pradesh by Beohar Raghubir Singh and his three grandsons. Beohar Raghubir Singh's son, Beohar Rajendra Sinha, was a pro forma defendant. A notice under section 80 of Civil Procedure Code had been given by Raghubir Singh on 11th January, 1954. Plaintiffs 2, 3 and 4, his grandsons were joined as plaintiffs because in a partition made subsequent to the giving of the notice, they were each entitled to 1/5th share along with the first plaintiff. Beohar Rajendra Sinha was joined as a defendant because he did not choose to join as the plaintiff. The plaintiffs sought a declaration (1) that the three nazul plots in suit had been in possession of the plaintiffs and the predecessors in their own right from time immemorial and their status was that of Raiyat Sarkar; and (2) that the order of the State Government in the Survey and Settlement Department refusing to recognise their possession over the plots was wrong and ultra vires. The dispute relates to Phoota Tal a tank situated within the town of Jabalpur. It was plot No. 282 in the settlement of 1863 A.D. Its area then was 957 5.24 acres. it was recorded as malkiat Sarkar and in the last column there was an entry showing possession of Aman Singh Thakur Prasad. The next settlement took place in 1890-91. The survey number of Phoota Tal was changed to plot No. 325. Its area remained the same, it was recorded as 'water (pani)' and in the last column, the entry showed the possession of Beohar Narpatsingh Raghubir Singh. The third settlement took place in 1909-10. The plot number of Phoota Tal was then changed to 327. Its area remained the same it was still recorded as 'water', but there was no entry in favour of any one showing possession. The nazul settlement took place in 1922-23. In this settlement, the tank was given numbers 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 171. Its area was recorded as 5.24 acres. In this settlement about 2 acres of land was found to be occupied by the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur. The land so found to be occupied was recorded in the possession of the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur and the remaining land was again recorded as 'Milkiat Sarkar'. There was no entry regarding possession in the remarks column so far as the remaining land was concerned. The plaintiffs alleged that Thakur Prasad and Aman Singh were their ancestors, that they had been in continuous possession of the disputed land and the omission to record their possession in the last two settlements of 1909-10 and 1922-23 was due to some oversight. In 1948 the first plaintiff made an application for correction to the Deputy Commissioner, Jabalpur who made an order in his favour exhibit P-5. The order of the Deputy Commissioner was however set aside by the State Government on 28th May, 1953 and it was held that the plaintiffs had no title to the disputed land. The plaintiff therefore prayed for a declaration of the title to the disputed plots and for the correction of the entry in the settlement record showing the status of the plaintiff as that of 'Raiyat Sarkar'. The suit was contested by the State of Madhya Pradesh. It was urged that the plaintiff had no possession over the disputed land and the order of the State Government dated 28th May, 1953 was correct. It was contended that plaintiffs 2, 3 and 4 had no right to institute the suit because no notice under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code was given on their behalf. The suit was not contested by the second defendant Beohar Rajendra Sinha. By its judgment dated 24th January, 1959 the trial court held that there was no documentary evidence from 1891 to 1932 to support the possession of the ancestors of the plaintiffs regarding Phoota Tal. The trial court also held that in all the settlement entries, the land was recorded as belonging to the Government 'Milkiat Sarkar'. In any event, between 1891 to 1932 there was no evidence regarding the user of the property by the plaintiffs and in the subsequent years a part of the property was found in possession of the Municipal Committee. The trial court dismissed the suit. Against the judgment of the trial court the plaintiffs preferred an appeal to the High Court. The High Court held in the first place the notice exhibit P-8 was not in conformity with section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code. The High Court held that Beohar Raghubir Singh had lost the right to represent the joint family as karta at the time of institution of the suit because there had been a severance of joint status and the notice served by Beohar Raghubir Singh could not ensure to the benefit of the other plaintiffs. On the merits of the case, the High Court found that the plaintiffs had established their possession for the statutory period of 60 years. The High Court held that the plaintiffs had acquired the right of Raiyat Sarkar and that the order of the State Government refusing to correct the revenue record was illegal. On these findings the High Court modified the judgment of the trial court to the extent that there was a declaration in favour of the plaintiffs that they were entitled to 1/5th share of the property in dispute and the claim regarding the 4/5th share was dismissed. The order of the State Government dated 28th May, 1953 refusing to recognise the possession of the plaintiffs was held to be wrong and illegal. The first question to be considered in these appeals is whether the High Court was right in holding that the notice given under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code by the first plaintiff was effective only with regard to Raghubir Singh and the notice was ineffective with regard to the other plaintiffs and therefore Raghubir Singh alone was entitled to a declaration as regards the 1/5th share of the dispute plot. On behalf of defendant No. 1 it was contended by Mr. Shroff that at the time of giving notice the plaintiffs and the second defendant were joint and plaintiff No. 1 Raghubir Singh was karta of the joint family. The notice was given on 11th January, 1954 and the suit was instituted on 20th July, 1954. It was admitted that between these two dates there was a disruption of the joint family of which Raghubir Singh was a karta. It was argued that the right of the first plaintiff to represent the family had come to an end before the institution of the suit, and hence plaintiffs 2, 3 and 4 had to comply individually with the provisions of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code before appearing as plaintiffs in the suit. In our opinion, there is no justification for this argument. We consider that there is substantial identity between the person giving the notice and the persons filing the suit in the present case. At the time of giving notice the first plaintiff Beohar Raghubir Singh was admittedly the eldest member of the joint family and being a karta he was entitled to represent the joint family in all its affairs. The cause of action had accrued at the time of giving of the notice and it was not necessary to give a second notice merely because there was a severance of the joint family, before 20th July, 1954 when the suit was actually instituted. It is obvious that the notice was given by Beohar Raghubir Singh as a representative of the joint family and in view of the subsequent partition the suit had to be instituted by all the divided members of the joint family. We are of the opinion that the notice given by Beohar Raghubir Singh on 11th January, 1954 was sufficient in law to sustain a suit brought by all the divided coparceners who must be deemed to be as much the authors of the notice as the karta who was the actual signatory of the notice. There is substantial identity between the person giving the notice and the persons bringing the suit in the present case and the argument of defendant No. 1 on this point must be rejected. The object of the notice under section 80, Civil Procedure Code is to give to the Government or the public servant concerned an opportunity to reconsider its or his legal position and if that course is justified to make amends or settle the claim out of court. The section is no doubt imperative; failure to serve notice complying with the requirements of the statute will entail dismissal of the suit. But the notice must be reasonably construed. Any unimportant error or defect cannot be permitted to be treated as an excuse for defeating a just claim. In considering whether the provisions of the statute are complied with, the Court must take into account the following matters in each case (1) whether the name, description and residence of the plaintiff are given so as to enable the authorities to identify the person serving the notice; (2) whether the cause of action and the relief which the plaintiff claims are set out with sufficient particularity; (3) whether a notice in writing has been delivered to or left at the office of the appropriate authority mentioned in the section; and (4) whether the suit is instituted after the expiration of two months next after notice has been served, and the plaint contains a statement that such a notice has been so delivered or left. In construing the notice the Court cannot ignore the object of the legislature, viz., to give to the Government or the public servant concerned an opportunity to reconsider its or his legal position. If on a reasonable reading of the notice the plaintiff is shown to have given the information which the statute requires him to give, any incidental defects or irregularities should be ignored. In the present case, the notice was served on 11th January, 1954 by Beohar Raghubir Singh. The notice stated the cause of action arising in favour of the joint family. The requirements as to cause of action, the name, description and residence of the plaintiff were complied with and the reliefs which the plaintiff claimed were duly set out in the notice. It is true that Beohar Raghubir Singh did not expressly describe himself as the karta. But reading the contents of the notice exhibit P-8 in a reasonable manner it appears to us that the claim of Beohar Raghubir Singh was made on behalf of the joint family. It is true that the term of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code must be strictly complied but that does not mean that the terms of the notice should be scrutinised in an artificial or pedantic manner. In Dhian Singh Sobha Singh & Anr. vs The Union of India & Anr. Bhagwati, J. observed in the course of his judgment: 'We are constrained to observe that the approach of the High Court to this question was not well founded. The Privy Council no doubt laid down in Bhagchand Dagadusa vs Secretary of State that the terms of this section should be strictly complied with. That does not however mean that the terms of the notice should be scrutinised in a pedantic manner or in a manner completely divorced from common sense. As was stated by Pollock C.B. in Jones vs Nicholls We must import a little common sense into notices of this kind'. Beaumont, C.J., also observed in Chandu Lal Vadilal vs Government of Bombay 'One must construe section 80 with some regard to common sense and to the object with which it appears to have been passed..' As already pointed out, the suit was instituted in the present case by the divided members of Hindu joint family on 20th July, 1954. The notice had been given on 11th January, 1954 by Beohar Raghubir Singh who was the karta of the undivided joint family. In our opinion there was identity between the person giving a notice and the persons filing the suit because it must be deemed in law that each of the plaintiffs had given the notice under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code through the karta Beohar Raghubir Singh. It is not disputed that the cause of action set out in the notice remained unchanged in the suit. It is also not said that the relief set out in the plaint is different from the relief set out in the notice. We are accordingly of the opinion that the notice given by the karta was sufficient to sustain the suit brought by the divided coparceners and the decision of the High Court on this point must be over ruled. The view that we have expressed is borne out by the judgment of this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh vs Gundugola Venkata Suryanarayan Garu. In that case, the Government of Madras applied the provisions of the Madras Estates Rent Reduction Act, 1947 to the lands in the village Mallindhapuram on the ground that the grant was of the whole village and hence an estate within the meaning of section 3(2)(d) of the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908. The respondent and another person served a notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure upon the Government of the State of Madras in which they challenged the above mentioned notification and asked the Government not to act upon it. Out of the two persons who gave the notice, the respondent alone filed the suit. The trial court held that the original grant was not of the entire village and was not so confirmed or recognised by the Government of Madras and as it was not an 'Estate' within the meaning of section 3(2)(d) of the Madras Estates Land Act, the Madras Rent Reduction Act, 1947 did not apply to it. But the suit was dismissed on the ground that although two persons had given notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only one person had filed the suit. The High Court agreed with the trial court that the grant was not of an entire village but it also held that the notice was not defective and the suit was maintainable as it was a representative suit and the permission of the Court under O.1, r. 8 had been obtained in this case. The High Court granted the respondent the relief prayed for by him. Against the order of the High Court the appellant appealed to this Court which dismissed the appeal holding that in the circumstances of the case there was no illegality even though the notice was given by two persons and the suit was filed by only one. If the Court grants permission to one person to institute a representative suit and if the person had served the notice under section 80, the circumstance that another person had joined him in serving the notice but did not join him in the suit, was not a sufficient ground for regarding the suit as defective. At page 953 of the Report Shah, J. observed as follows: 'The notice in the present suit was served by the plaintiff and Yegneswara Sastri. They raised a grievance about the notification issued by the Government of Madras on May 16, 1950; it was not an individual grievance of the two persons who served the notice but of all the Inamdars or agrahamdars. The relief for which the suit was intended to be filed was also not restricted to their personal claim. The notice stated the cause of action arising in favour of all the Inamdars, and it is not disputed that the notice set out the relief which would be claimable by all the Inamdars or on their behalf in default of compliance with the requisition. The plaintiff it is true alone filed the suit, but he was permitted to sue for and on behalf of all the Inamdars by an order of the Court under O. 1, r. 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The requirements as to the cause of action, the name, description and place of residence of the plaintiff was therefore complied with and the relief which the plaintiff claimed was duly set out in the notice. The only departure from the notice was that two persons served a notice under section 80 informing the Government that proceedings would be started, in default of compliance with the requisition, for violation of the rights of the Inamdars, and one person only out of the two instituted the suit. That in our judgment is not a defect which brings the case within the terms of section 80'. On behalf of respondent No. 1 reference was made to the two decisions of the Judicial Committee in Vellayan Chettiar & Ors. vs Government of the Province of Madras and Anr. and Government of the Province of Bombay vs Pestonji Ardeshir Wadia & Ors. But the principle of these decisions has no bearing on the question presented for determination in the present case. In Vellayan Chettiar's case a notice was given by one plaintiff stating the cause of action, his name, description and place of his residence and the relief which he claimed although the suit was instituted by him and another. It was observed by the Judicial Committee: 'The section according to its plain meaning requires that there should be in the language of the High Court of Madras identity of the person who issues the notice with the person who brings the suit': See Venkata Rangiah Appa Rao vs Secretary of State and on appeal Venkata Rangiah Appa Rao vs Secretary of State. To hold otherwise would be to admit an implication or exception for which there is no jurisdiction.' Two persons had sued for a declaration that certain lands belonged to them, and for an order setting aside the decision of the Appellate Survey Officer in regard to those lands. It was found that one alone out of the two persons had served the notice. The relief claimed by the two persons was personal to them and the right thereto arose out of their title to the land claimed by them. It was held by the Judicial Committee that without a proper notice under section 80 the suit could not be instituted for to hold otherwise would be to admit an implication or exception for which there was no justification. In the other case, in Pestonji Ardeshir Wadia's case two trustees of a trust served a notice in October, 1933 upon the Government of Bombay under section 80 intimating that the trustees intended to institute a suit against the Government on the cause of action and for the relief set out therein. One of the trustees died before the plaint was lodged in court, and two more trustees were appointed in the place of the deceased trustee. Thereafter the two new trustees and the surviving trustee filed the suit out of which the appeal arose which was decided by the Judicial Committee. No notice was served on the Government on behalf of the two new trustees. The Judicial Committee accepted the view of the High Court that where there were three plaintiffs, the names and addresses of all of them must be given in the notice. Their Lordships observed that: 'the provisions of section 80 of the Code are imperative and should be strictly complied with before it can be said that a notice valid in law has been served on the Government. In the present case it is not contended that any notice on behalf of plaintiffs 2 and 3 was served on the Government before the filing of the suit'. It is clear that the principle of these two decisions of the Judicial Committee has no application in the present case because the material facts are different. We proceed to consider the next question arising in these appeals viz., whether the High Court was right in holding that the plaintiffs had established their title as raiyat sarkar with regard to 1/5th share in nazul plots Nos. 34/3, 33 and 171/1 mentioned in the Deputy Commissioner's order dated 7th May, 1948 in Revenue Case No. 9/45-46. It was argued on behalf of defendant No. 1 that there was no evidence to show that the plaintiffs were in possession of the land from 1909 to 1932, and the plaintiffs had not established their title by prescription for the statutory period of 60 years. It was contended that the High Court had no justification for holding that the plaintiffs had established the title of 'Raiyat Sarkar' and the finding of the High Court was not based upon any evidence. In our opinion, the argument put forward on behalf of defendant No. 1 is well-founded and must be accepted as correct. In the settlement of 1863 the names of Amansingh and Thakurprasad were noted in the remarks column. But the column regarding tenancy right is definitely blank. The owner is shown in the Khasra as the State 'Milkiat Sarkar'. In the settlement of 1890-91 Amansingh Narpatsingh is again shown in the remarks column of the khata. But the column regarding any kind of tenancy right is again blank. It is clear that in the settlements of 1863 and 1890-91 the ownership of the land is recorded as that of the Government. The possession of the plaintiffs or of their ancestors could not be attributed to ownership or tenancy right of the property. In the settlement of 1909-10, exhibit P-3 there is no entry in the remarks column showing the possession of the ancestors of the plaintiffs. It was said on behalf of the plaintiffs that no notice was given to them of the proceedings of the settlement of 1909-10. Even assuming that this allegation is correct, the entries of the khasra P-3 cannot be treated to be a nullity and of no effect. In any event, it was open to the plaintiffs to adduce other reliable evidence to prove their possession between the years 1909 to 1932. But the plaintiffs have failed to produce any such evidence. In the nazul settlement of 1922-23 the tank was given new plot numbers 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 171 and its area was recorded as 5.24 acres. In this settlement about 2 acres of land was found to be occupied by the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur. The land so found to be occupied was recorded in the possession of the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur and the remaining land was again recorded as 'Milkiat Sarkar'. There is no entry as regards the remaining land recording anybody's possession in the remarks column. Actually proclamations were made during this settlement and objections were invited as per exhibit ID-14. A date was fixed up to 31-8-1924 but no one came forward. The proclamation clearly recited that the vacant sites which were not in possession of anybody were not recognised as belonging to any person. It is impossible to believe that the plaintiffs or their ancestors were unaware of such a proclamation. Had they been in possession they would not have failed to make a claim. For the period after 1933-34 the plaintiffs produced account books to show that they exercised certain rights. Certain receipts were also proved but they also relate to a period after 1939. We have gone through the oral evidence produced by the plaintiffs and it appears to be unreliable. The result is that for the period 1891 till 1932 there is no reliable oral or documentary evidence to prove that the plaintiffs or their ancestors had any possession over the disputed land. On the contrary the disputed land i.e. Phoota Tal was always recognised as Milkiat Sarkar and the State Government was justified in holding that the order of the Deputy Commissioner dated 7th May, 1948 should be set aside. In the course of the argument reference was made by Mr. Gupte to the following passage in the Central Provinces Settlement Instructions (Reprint of 1953) page 213 'In dealing with proposed method of the settlement of titles it will be convenient in order to remove all causes for misapprehension among residents, to lay emphasis on the policy of Government in making these settlements. That policy was defined in the Chief Commissioner's Resolution No. 502-B-X dated the 19th October, 1917, in the Revenue & Scarcity Department, but its main principles will bear repetition. As it is not the intention of Government in making the settlement to disturb long possession, but only to obtain an accurate record of the lands which are its property and to secure its right to any land revenue to which it may be entitled, long possession even without clear proof of a definite grant from Government will be recognised as entitled the holder to possession. In deciding what constitutes long possession in any individual town, regard will be had to the special circumstances of the place, and while this point will be dealt with more particularly in the Deputy Commissioner's report, the following general principles will ordinarily be observed: (1) all occupants who are able to prove possession to any land prior to 1891 or such later date as may be fixed for each town, either by themselves or by a valid title from a previous holder, and all occupants who can prove a definite grant or lease from Government will be recorded as entitled to hold such land as against Government (paragraph 6 of the Resolution)' On the basis of this passage it was argued that it was the duty of the settlement officer to treat the plaintiffs as having established their title because they were shown to be in possession in the settlement of the year 1890-91. We are unable to accept this argument as correct. The passage quoted above only applies to a case where the ownership of the land was unknown i.e. where possession is proved for a long time, but its original title could not be traced, and not to a case where the land is recorded as Government land. For the reasons expressed, we hold that the suit brought by the plaintiffs being Civil Suit No. 10-A of 1954 should be dismissed. Civil Appeal 386 of 1966 is accordingly dismissed and Civil Appeal 387 of 1966 is allowed with costs in favour of defendant No. 1 i.e. State of Madhya Pradesh. There will be one hearing fee. R.K.P.S. Civil Appeal 386/66 dismissed. Civil Appeal 387/66 allowed.",

            "judgement": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 56 of 1956. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated February 4, 1954, of the U. P. Board of Revenue in Appeal No. 96 of 1948-49. Dewan Charanjit Lal, for the appellants. S. P. Sinha, J. B. Dadachanji, S. N. Andley and Rameshwar Nath, for the respondents. 1957. November 21. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AIYAR J.-The facts material for purposes of this appeal have been stated by us in our order dated February 6, 1957, and may be briefly recapitulated. The suit property is agricultural land of the extent of 10 Bighas, 13 Biswas. On July 8, 1930, the then owners of the land, Ram Prashad and Udairaj, executed a usufructuary mortgage over it and certain other properties, with which we are not concerned in this litigation, in favour of Dwaraka Prashad, Naubat Singh and Munshilal. The lands were originally held in Sir by the mortgagors, but as part of their bargain with the mortgagees, they applied to have their names removed from the Sir, and that was done by an order dated June 18, 1930, the lands being thereafter entered as Khudkasht in the names of the mortgagees. In 1941, Ram Prashad, the surviving mortgagor, filed Suit No. 132 of 1941 for redemption of the mortgage. The suit was contested, but it was eventually decreed, the amount due to the mortgagees being fixed at Rs. 1,860. Subsequent to the decree, Ram Prashad died leaving him surviving, the appellants herein, as his legal representatives. On September 6,1945, the amount due under the mortgage was paid by them and the mortgage was redeemed. When they sought to take possession of the suit properties, they were obstructed by Govind Sahai and Bhagwan Sahai, who claimed to have been admitted as tenants by the mortgagees. Thereafter, the appellants filed the suit, out of which the present appeal arises, under s. 180 of the U. P. Tenancy Act No. XVII of 1939, hereinafter referred to as the Act, to eject them, treating them as trespassers. The defendants resisted the suit on various grounds, of which only one is now material. They claimed that they were not trespassers but hereditary tenants under the Act, and could not therefore be ejected, and Issue 2 was raised with reference to this plea. The Revenue Officer, Meerut, who tried the suit held on this Issue that as the lands had been held by the mortgagors as Sir, and that as the mortgagees had been themselves cultivating them as Khudkasht, the defendants could not be held to be hereditary tenants, and passed accordingly a decree in ejectment in favour of the appellants, and this decree was confirmed on appeal by the Commissioner, Meerut Division. The defendants took the matter in appeal to the Board of Revenue (Second Appeal No. 96 of 1948). By its judgment and decree dated February 4, 1954, the Board held that the defendants had been put in possession by the mortgagees under a Kabuliat dated May 26, 1936, that the rent fixed under the Kabuliat, Rs. 112 per annum, was a reasonable rate of rent as the circle rate was Rs. 76-6-0, and that, therefore, the settlement was binding on the mortgagors, as it was for 'prudent and economic rent'. On this finding, it allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. Against this judgment, the plaintiffs have preferred this appeal by special leave. At the original hearing before us, the main contention pressed by the appellants was that the Kabuliat dated May 26, 1936, was not referred to in the written statement, and had not been exhibited at the trial, and that, therefore, no relief should have been granted on the basis of that document in second appeal. We, however, came to the conclusion that as the point had been raised, though not clearly in the written statement, it ought to be tried on the merits, and we accordingly remanded the case to the Board of Revenue for trial on the following two Issues: (1) Whether the lease deed dated May 26, 1936, by the mortgagees in favour of the respondents is true and legally valid; and (2) Whether the said lease is binding on the appellants. At the re-hearing which we directed, the parties have adduced fresh evidence on both the Issues, and the Board of Revenue has submitted its findings thereon. On the first Issue, it has held that no lease deed had been executed by the mortgagees in favour of the lessees, but that the latter had executed a Kabuliat in favour of the mortgagees on May 26, 1936, and that its truth had not been questioned. On the second Issue, its finding is as follows: 'Whether the Qabuliat was binding or not depended on the question whether mortgagees had a right to settle the land and whether such settlement was binding on the mortgagors. There was nothing in the mortgage deed which would prevent the mortgagees from settling the land, even though the land was, khud-kasht or even if the period of settlement was beyond the period of mortgage. The mortgagees acted in the prudent management of the property settling the land on an economic rent. The action of the mortgagees was, therefore, binding on the mortgagors. Hence the Qabuliat was binding on the appellants.' The appellants attack both these findings as incorrect. As regards the first Issue, their contention is that in view of the finding that the mortgagees had not executed any lease deed, Govind Sahai and Bhagwan Sahai could not claim the status of tenants solely on the strength of the Kabuliat executed by them on May 26, 1936, as that was merely a unilateral undertaking by them to cultivate. But the mortgagees have given evidence that they accepted the Kabuliat and received rent as provided therein. There is, therefore, no substance in this objection, which must be overruled. The main controversy in this appeal relates to the finding on the second Issue. The appellants complain that the Board has merely repeated its previous finding on the point without reference either to the requirements of s. 76(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, or to the evidence that had been adduced by the parties at the remand. We are constrained to observe that this complaint is well-founded. The law undoubtedly is that no person can transfer property so as to confer on the transferee a title better than what he possesses. Therefore, any transfer of the property mortgaged, by the mortgagee must cease, when the mortgage is redeemed. Now, s. 76(a) provides that a mortgagee in possession 'must manage the property as a person of ordinary prudence would manage it if it were his own.' Though on the language of the statute, this is an obligation cast on the mortgagee, the authorities have held that an agricultural lease created by him would be binding on the mortgagor even though the mortgage has been redeemed, provided it is of such a character that a prudent owner of property would enter into it in the usual course of management. This being in the nature of an exception, it is for the person who claims the benefit thereof, to strictly establish it. Now, the question is whether the respondents have proved that the lease of which the Kabuliat dated May 26, 1936, is a counter-part, is one which a prudent owner would create in the management of his properties. The Board has answered the question in favour of the respondents on two grounds. One is that the mortgage deed dated July 8, 1930, contains no prohibition against letting of the lands by the mortgagees. If there is such a prohibition, there is the authority of this Court in Mahabir Gope and others v. Harbans Narain Singh and others (1) that the lease will not be binding on the mortgagors. But where there is no such prohibition, the only consequence is that the parties will be thrown back on their rights under the Transfer of Property Act, and the lessees must still establish that the lease is binding on the mortgagors under s. 76(a) of that Act. The second ground on which the Board has based its conclusion that the lease is binding on the appellants is that the rent fixed in the Kabuliat, Rs. 112 is higher than the circle rate of Rs. 76-6-0. But this is not decisive of the matter, as what has to be decided is not whether the rent fixed compares favourably with the circle rate, but whether it is reasonable and fair, having regard to the income which a prudent owner could have got from the lands, and that will depend on proof of the net yield from the land and the ruling price of the produce at that time. The lessees have given no evidence on this point. One of the mortgagees stated that he and his brothers were themselves cultivating the lands till 1936, and that they then gave them on lease, because they were losing Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 per annum over the transaction. But he gave no particulars as to what the gross yield from the lands was, what the expenses of cultivation were, and what the price of the produce was. It is very difficult to believe that the tenants would have agreed to take over lands on the terms contained in the Kabuliat if, in fact, it was a losing concern. It is admitted by the mortgagee that the lessees made no complaint that they were working at a loss. His evidence on this point is vague and unconvincing, and we are not impressed by it. On the other hand, we have evidence which clinches the matter in favour of the appellants. It has been already stated that the Revenue Officer, Meerut granted a decree in favour of the appellants for ejectment. In execution of this decree, the appellants obtained possession of the suit properties. On February 4, 1954, the Board set aside the decrees of the Courts below, and dismissed the suit of the appellants. Thereupon, the respondents in execution of the decree got back possession of the properties. Then, they applied under s. 144, Code of Civil Procedure for recovery of mesne profits by way of restitution, and obtained a decree for Rs. 7,500 at the rate of Rs. 1,000 per annum. If this figure is any guide for the determination of what income could be got from the properties by a prudent owner, then it is clear beyond doubt that the rent of Rs. 112 fixed in the Kabuliat is unduly low, and it cannot be binding on the mortgagors. It is true that the decree relates to a period much later than the date of the Kabuliat, and that prices had greatly risen during that period. But making all allowance for the rise, we think that the transaction is not one which a prudent owner would enter into in respect of his properties. It was argued by Mr. Sinha for the respondents that the decree passed in restitution proceedings is under appeal before the Commissioner of Meerut, and should not, therefore, be taken into account in determining whether the rent fixed in the Kabuliat was fair and such, as would be binding on the mortgagors. But this decree was passed on the application of the respondents claiming mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 1,000 per annum, assuming that they did not ask for more, and its importance lies not so much in its being an adjudication by the Court as in its evidencing an admission by them as to the net profits which could be realised from the lands. It would be material in this connection to refer to the character of the lands over which the lease was created. They were held in Sir by the mortgagors and after the execution of the mortgage, entered as Khudkasht in the names of the mortgagees. They were home-farm lands under the direct cultivation of the proprietors, as distinguished from lands which were under cultivation by tenants, and having regard to the special rights which the tenancy laws all over India have recognised in the owner in respect of such lands, an act of the mortgagee which puts those rights in peril cannot, as held in Mahabir Gope and others v. Harbans Narain Singh and others (supra), be regarded as that of a prudent owner, and it requires exceptional grounds to justify it. Of that, there is no evidence. On the other hand, the uncontradicted evidence on the side of the appellants is that the lands have got facilities of canal irrigation, and are very fertile, and that it would not be economic to lease them to tenants. It also appears that the mortgagees created on the eve of redemption another lease, and that has been set aside on the ground that it was entered into with a view to defeat the mortgagors. Their action in leasing the lands to tenants on the terms set out in the Kabuliat is neither prudent nor bona fide, and on a consideration of the entire evidence, we are of opinion, differing from the Board, that the lease evidenced by the Kabuliat is not binding on the mortgagors. It was next contended by Mr. Sinha that even if the Kabuliat was not binding on the mortgagors, the respondents would, nevertheless, be hereditary tenants under the provisions of the U. P. Tenancy Act, 1939, and that the appellants would have no right to eject them, and he referred us to the provisions of the Act bearing on the question. Section 29(a) of the Act provides that every person who was at the commencement of the Act a tenant of land shall be entitled to all the rights of hereditary tenants under the Act. Some classes of tenants are excepted from the operation of this provision, and one of them is tenants of Sir lands. Section 30(6) enacts that, 'Notwithstanding anything in section 29, hereditary rights shall not accrue in land transferred by a mortgage to which the provisions of the second paragraph of sub-section (5) of section 15 of the Agra Tenancy Act, 1926 apply during the period specified in that paragraph.' The provision in the Agra Tenancy Act, 1926, referred to above, runs as follows: 'Notwithstanding anything in this section, where the property transferred by means of a mortgage of the kind specified in sub-section (5) of section 14 consists wholly of a specified area or sir, the mortgagor may by simultaneous agreement in writing waive his exproprietary rights, and in that case the mortgaged land shall, if the mortgagor regains within twelve years of the date of the transfer possession thereof on redemption of the mortgage, resume the character of sir. In such land, statutory rights shall not accrue for twelve years from the date of transfer.' One other provision to which reference was made is the second proviso to s. 11 of the U. P. Tenancy Act, 1939, which is as follows: 'Provided further that if on redemption of a mortgage the mortgagor regains possession of.positions of the U. P. Tenancy Act, 1939, and the Agra Tenancy Act, 1926, to argue that the respondents were hereditary tenants?",

            "judgement": "CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 149 of 1954. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated October 20, 1953, of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 349 of 1953. S. A. Desai and I. N. Shroff, for the-appellant. Porus A. Mehta and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent. 1957. February 19. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-This appeal with special leave under Art. 136 of the Constitution is directed against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay setting aside the acquittal of the appellant by the Court of the Presidency Magistrate, 19th Court, Bombay and ordering his re-trial by the Court of the Special Judge, Greater Bombay in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (Act XLVI of 1952). The appellant was accused No. 3 in the Court of the learned Presidency Magistrate. Accused No. 1 was the Mehta in the employ of a firm called Messrs. M. M. Baxabhoy & Co., accused No. 2 was the manager of the said firm. The appellant and accused Nos. 4 and 5 were Receivers of the firm in litigation in regard to it. They were all charged with offences under s. 161 read with s. 116 and further read either with s. 109 or s. 114 of the Indian Penal Code for offering to one Jibhai Chhotalal Barot, a sub-inspector of police attached to the Anti-Corruption Branch of the C. I. D. the sum of Rs. 1,25,000 as illegal gratification other than legal remuneration as' a motive or reward for his showing favour to the accused and to the firm M/s. M. M. Baxabhoy & Co., in the exercise of his official functions. The offence was alleged to have been committed on July 28, 1950, and the accused were charge-sheeted on June 16, 1951; the trial commenced on July 14, 1951 and charges were framed on September 27, 1951. 40 witnesses were examined and 226 documents were exhibited in the course of the trial, and the prosecution closed its case on July 15, 1952. During the course of the trial the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (XLVI of 1952) hereinafter called the impugned Act was enacted by Parliament on July 28, 1952, being an Act further to amend the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and to provide for a more speedy trial of certain offences, viz., offences punishable under s. 161,s.165 or s. 165A of the Indian Penal Code or sub-s. 2 of s. 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (ActII of 1947) and any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of any of the offences specified above. The learned Presidency Magistrate proceeded with the trial and after the examination of the appellant under s. 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the appellant filed his written statement on August 14, 1952. The addresses commenced thereafter. The prosecution commenced its address on August 26, 1952, ending it on September 5, 1952. The defence thereafter addressed the learned Magistrate. In the meantime on September 23, 1952, the Government of Bombay by a notification appointed a Special Judge to try offences specified above and this -appointment was notified in the Official Gazette on September 26, 1952. The defence concluded its address on September 26, 1952 and the learned Presidency Magistrate delivered his judgment on September 29, 1952, whereby he convicted the Accused Nos. 1 and 2 of the offences with which they were charged and sentenced them each to nine months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000 in default 6 months' rigorous imprisonment. He however acquitted the appellant and the accused Nos. 4 and 5 of these offences. The accused No. 2 carried an appeal before the High Court of Bombay being Criminal Appeal No. 1304 of 1952. The State of Bombay also thereupon filed an appeal against the acquittal of the appellant and accused Nos. 4 and 5 being Criminal Appeal No. 349 of 1953. In the memorandum of appeal in Criminal Appeal No. 349 of 1953 a point was taken that the learned Presidency Magistrate had no jurisdiction to continue the trial and acquit the appellant and accused Nos. 4 and 5 as the same was ousted by the impugned Act. It was contended that since the date the said Act came into force the Special Judge alone had jurisdiction to try the accused for the offence under s. 161 read with s. 116 of the Indian Penal Code, that the duty of the learned Presidency Magistrate was to transfer this case to the Court of the Special Judge for Greater Bombay, specially appointed to try such offences by the impugned Act and that the order of acquittal of the appellant and accused Nos. 4 and 5 was therefore erroneous in law being without jurisdiction. Both these Criminal Appeals came up for hearing before a Bench of the Bombay High Court consisting of Bavadekar & Vyas JJ. These appeals were heard only on the preliminary point as to the jurisdiction of the learned Presidency Magistrate to try and decide the case. In reply to the point as to jurisdiction which had been taken by the State of Bombay, the appellant and the accused Nos. 4 and 5 urged that the provisions of the impugned Act were violative of the principle of equal protection of laws contained in Art. 14 of the Constitution and therefore the impugned Act was ultra vires the Constitution. If that was so, it was contended, the learned Presidency Magistrate had jurisdiction to continue the trial in spite of the commencement of the impugned Act and the order of acquittal of the appellant and accused Nos. 4 and 5 recorded by him was correct. The learned judges of the High Court rejected this contention of the appellant and held that the impugned Act was intra vires and that the learned Presidency Magistrate had no jurisdiction to try the case after the commencement of the impugned Act. The learned Magistrate's order convicting the accused No. 2 and acquitting the appellant and the accused Nos. 4 and 5 complained of by the State of Bombay was accordingly set aside. The High Court ordered a re-trial of the appellant and the other accused by the Court of the Special Judge, Greater Bombay, and remanded the case for disposal according to law. The appellant applied to the High Court for a certificate under Art. 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution which was however refused. The appellant thereafter applied for and obtained from this Court special leave to appeal against the judgment and order passed by the High Court. This is how the appeal has come up for hearing and final disposal before us. It will be convenient at this stage to set out the relevant provisions of the impugned Act. As already noted the preamble to the Act stated that it was an Act further to amend the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, and to provide for a more speedy trial of certain offences. Section 5 of the Act inserted sub-s. (2- B) in s. 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and provided that in every case where the offence is punishable under s. 161 or s. 165 or s. 165-A of the Indian Penal Code or sub-s. (2) of section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, .......................................... then notwithstanding anything contained in sub-s. (2-A), the Magistrate shall, without making any further enquiry, send the case for trial to the Court of the Special Judge appointed under the impugned Act. This amendment was to remain in force for a period of two years from the commence- ment of the impugned Act, but was subsequently incorporated in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, as s. 337 (2-B) by s. 59 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Act, 1955 (Act XXVI of 1955). Section 6 of the Act provided for the appointment of Special Judges and empowered the State Governments by notification in the Official Gazette to appoint as many Special Judges as may be necessary for such area or areas as may be specified in the notification to try the following offences, namely: (a) an offence punishable under s. 161, s. 165 or s. 165-A of the Indian Penal Code or sub-s. (2) of s. 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947; and (b) any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of the offences specified in cl. (a) above. Section 6 (2) laid down the qualifications for the appointment of a Special Judge and provided that: a person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Special Judge under this Act unless he was or had been a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Section 7 of the Act is important and provided that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 or any other law the offences specified in sub-s. (1) of s. 6 shall be triable by special judges only. Section 7(2) further provided that when trying any case, a Special Judge may also try any offence other than an offence specified in s. 6 with which the accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 be charged at the same trial. The procedure and powers of special judges were laid down in s. 6 of the Act. A Special Judge was empowered to take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial, and in trying the accused persons, he was to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates. A Special Judge was also empowered to tender a pardon to any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in, or privy to, an offence on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned, whether as a principal or abetter, in the commission thereof. Save as above the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 were so far as they were not inconsistent with the Act made applicable to the proceedings before a Special Judge, and for the purposes of the said provisions, the Court of the Special Judge was deemed to be a Court of Sessions trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors. A Special Judge was empowered to pass upon any person convicted by him any sentence authorised by law for the punishment of the offences of which such person was convicted. Section 9 of the Act provided for appeal and revision and the High Court was to exercise as far as applicable all the powers conferred by Chapters XXXI and XXXII -of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 on the High Court, as if the Court of the Special Judge were a Court of Sessions trying cases without a jury within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court. Section 10 is also important and provided for the transfer of certain cases pending before magistrates. It was laid down that all cases triable by a Special Judge under s. 7, which immediately before the commencement of the Act, were pending before any Magistrate shall, on such commencement, be forwarded for trial to the Special Judge having jurisdiction over such cases. It is clear from the provisions of the impugned Act set out hereinabove that the intention of the legislature in enacting the same was to amend the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 with a view to provide for a more speedy trial of offences punishable under ss. 161, 165 or 165-A, of the Indian Penal Code or sub-s. (2) of s. 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. Special Judges of the status of a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge were to be appointed for the purpose of trying these offences and these offences were made triable only by these Special Judges. Not only were the special judges invested with the exclusive jurisdiction to try these offences but they were also empowered while trying any case involving these offences to try any offence other than those offences with which the accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 be charged at the same trial. Committal proceedings were also done away with and the special judges were empowered to take cognizance of these offences without the accused being committed to them for trial and were empowered to try the accused persons of the same by following the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates. The courts of the Special Judges were deemed to be courts of Sessions trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and were also empowered to pass upon the persons convicted by them of any offence any sentence authorised by law for the punishment of such offences. The powers of appeal and revision vested in the High Court were to be exercised as if the courts of Special Judges were the courts of sessions trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court. The procedure for trial before the Special Judges was thus assimilated to that obtaining in the case of trial of the accused by the courts of sessions. Having thus provided for the trial by Special Judges of these offences which would be triable by them after the commencement of the impugned Act, the Act further provided for a transfer of cases falling within that category but pending before the magistrates. It may be noted that the other provisions of the Act were prospective in operation and could not affect pending cases as such. Provision had therefore to be made for divesting the magistrates who had already taken cognizance of these cases, of jurisdiction to try the same any further and for the transfer of such pending cases to the special judges who were appointed under the Act. The cases which were pending before the courts of sessions did not require to be so transferred because they would be tried by the procedure obtaining in the courts of sessions and nothing further required to be done. The cases which were pending before the Magistrates however required to be transferred to the Special Judges because otherwise the Magistrates would continue to try the same and would have to commit them to the courts of sessions, they themselves being unable to mete out the enhanced punishment which could be meted out to the accused on conviction. The Committal proceedings were sought to be eliminated by the impugned Act and the Special Judges were empowered to try these cases as if they were courts of sessions trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors. It was therefore provided that cases falling under this category which were pending before the magistrates should on the commencement of the impugned Act be forwarded for trial to the special judges having jurisdiction over such cases. This provision was made when these cases triable by the Special Judges under s. 7 of the Act were pending before the magistrates and the magistrates trying the same were ipso facto divested of the jurisdiction to try the same any further, the Special Judges appointed Under the Act having been invested with exclusive jurisdiction to try the same after the commencement of the Act. If this was the position under the impugned Act it followed without anything more that the instant case which was pending before the learned Presidency Magistrate on July 28, 1952, which was the date of the commencement of the Act, could not proceed any further before him. By the operation of s. 7 of the impugned Act, the learned Presidency Magistrate was divested of jurisdiction to try it and whatever proceedings were continued before him after July 28, 1952, were without jurisdiction and void. The examination of the appellant under s. 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the further proceedings by way of filing of the written statement and the arguments addressed by the prosecution as well as the defence were all without jurisdiction and so were the orders of conviction of the accused Nos. 1 and 2 and the acquittal of the appellant and the accused Nos. 4 and 5. It was however contended by the learned counsel for the appellant before us that the provisions of the impugned Act were violative of the fundamental right enshrined in Art. 14 of the Constitution and were therefore ultra vires. The respondents on the other hand urged that there was no classification at all and even if there was one, it was based on intelligible differentia and had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved. The provisions of the impugned Act in substance amended the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 pro tanto making the speci. fied offences triable by special judges and all persons who committed these offences became punishable by higher sentences and were subjected to, procedure for trial of warrant cases, the courts of the special judges being deemed to be courts of sessions trying cases without a jury or without the aid of asessors. It can therefore be legitimately urged that there was no classification at all, the provisions thus enacted being equally applicable to all citizens alike without any discrimination whatever. The matter was however argued before the High Court and also before us on the basis that the offenders who committed these specified offences formed a group or category by themselves and were classified as distinct from the offenders who committed the other offences under the Indian Penal Code. We do not want to express any opinion as to whether there is any classification discernible within the provisions of the impugned Act, but will proceed to deal with this aspect of the question on the assumption that there was such a classification intended to be made by the Legislature while enacting the impugned Act. The principles underlying Art. 14 of the Constitution have been completely thrashed out in the several decisions of this Court ere this. The earliest pronouncement of this Court on the meaning and scope of Art. 14 was made in the case of Chiranjit Lal Chowdhury v. The Union of India(1). The principles enunciated in that case were summarized by Fazl Ali J. as follows in The State of Bombay v. F. N. Balsara (2) : (1) The presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment, since it must be assumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discriminations are based on adequate grounds. (2) The presumption may be rebutted in certain cases by showing that on the face of the statute, there is no classification at all and no difference peculiar to any individual or class and not applicable to any other individual or class, and yet the law hits only a particular individual or class. (3) The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or circumstances in the same position, and the varying needs of different classes of persons often require separate treatment. (4) The principle does not take away from the State the power of classifying persons for legitimate purposes. (1) [1950] S.C.R. p. 869.-normalsize (2) [1951] S.C.R. 682, at P. 708. (5) Every classification is in some degree likely to produce some inequality, and mere production of inequality is not enough. (6) If a law deals equally with members of a well defined class, it is not obnoxious and it is not open to the charge of denial of equal protection on the ground that it has no application to other persons. (7) While reasonable classification is permissible, such classification must be based upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the object sought to be attained, and the classification cannot be made arbitrarily and without any substantial basis.' The latest pronouncement on this topic is to be found in the judgment of this Court in the case of Budhan Choudhry and Others v. The State of Bihar (1) where it was observed as follows: ' The provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution have come up for discussion before this Court in a number of cases, namely, Chiranjit Lal Chowdhury v. The Union of India (supra), The State of Bombay v. F. N. Balsara (supra), The State of West-Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar (2 Kathi Raning Rawat v. The State of Saurashtra(3), Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja v. The State of Bombay (4) Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad(5) and Habeeb Mohamad v. The State of Hyderabad(6) It is, therefore, not necessary to enter upon any length discussion as to the meaning, scope and effect of- the article in question. It is now well-established that while article 14 forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved (1) [1955] I S.C.R. I045 at p. 1048.(4) [1952] S.C.R. 710. (2) [1052] S.C.R. 284.(5) [1953] S.C.R. 589. (3) [1952] S.C.R. 435.(6) [1953] S.C.R. 661. by the statute in question. The classification may be founded on a different base namely, geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like. What is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act under consideration. It is also well-established by the decisions of this Court that article 14 condemns discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure We have to scrutinize the provisions of the impugned Act in the light of the principles enunciated above. The first question which we have to address to ourselves is whether there is in the impugned Act a reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. It we look to the provisions of the impugned Act closely it would appear that the legislature classified the offences punishable under ss. 161, 165 or 165-A of the Indian Penal Code or sub-s. 2 of s. 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 in one group or category. They were offences relating to bribery or corruption by public servants and were thus appropriately classified in one group or category. The classification was founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguished the offenders thus grouped together from those left out of the group. The persons who committed these offences of bribery or corruption would form a class by themselves quite distinct from those offenders who could be dealt with by the normal provisions contained in the Indian Penal Code or the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and if the offenders falling within this group or category were thus singled out for special treatment, there would be no question of any discriminatory treatment being meted out to, them as compared with other offenders who did not fall within the same group or category and who continued to be treated under the normal procedure. The next question to consider is whether this differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned Act. The preamble of the Act showed that it was enacted for providing a more speedy trial of certain offences. An argument was however addressed before us based on certain observations of Mahajan J. (as he then was) at page 314, and Mukherjea J. (as he then was) at p. 328 in Anwar Ali Sarkar's Case(1) quoted at page 43 by Patanjali Sastri C.J. in the case of Kedar Nath Bajoria V. The State of West Bengal (2) that the speedier trial of offences could not afford a reasonable basis for such classification. Standing by themselves these passages might lend support to the contention urged before us by the learned counsel for the appellant. It must be noted, however, that this ratio was not held to be conclusive by this Court in Kedar Nath Bajoria's Case(2) where this Court held: ' (1) That when a law like the present one is impugned on the ground that it contravenes art. 14 of the Constitution the real issue to be decided is whether, having regard to the underlying purpose and policy of the Act as disclosed by its title, preamble and provisions, the classification of the offences for the trial of which the Special Court is set up and a special procedure is laid down can be said to be unreasonable or arbitrary and therefore violative of the equal protection clause; (2) having regard to the fact that the types of offences specified in the Schedule to the Act were very common and widely prevalent during the post war period and has to be checked effectively and speedily tried, the legislation in question must be regarded as having been based on a perfectly intelligent principle of classification, having a clear and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved, and it did not in any way contravene art. 14 of the Constitution.' In the instant case, bribery and corruption having been rampant and the need for weeding them out having been urgently felt, it was necessary to enact measures for the purpose of 'eliminating all possible delay in bringing the offenders to book. It was with that end in view that provisions were enacted in the impugned Act for speedier trial of the said offences by the appointment of special judges who were invested with exclusive jurisdiction to try the same and were also empowered to take cognizance thereof without the accused being committed to them for trial, and follow ,the procedure prescribed for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates. The proceedings before the Special Judges were thus assimilated to those before the courts of sessions for trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the powers of appeal and revision invested in the High Court were also similarly circumscribed. All these provisions had the necessary effect of bringing about a speedier trial of these offences and it cannot be denied that this intelligible differentia had rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned Act. Both these conditions were thus fulfilled and it could not be urged that the provisions of the impugned Act were in any manner violative of art.'14 of the Constitution. It was next contended that even if the impugned Act was intra vires, the learned Presidency Magistrate trying the case of the appellant was not divested of jurisdiction to try the same after the commencement of the impugned Act and the acquittal of the appellant recorded by him could not be set aside. Reliance was placed upon s. 10 of the impugned Act in support of this contention. It was urged that even though the case related to the offence mentioned in s. 6(1) of the Act and was thus triable exclusively by the Special Judge, no Special Judge was appointed by the State Govern- ment by notification in the Official Gazette until September 26,1952, that the arguments were concluded and the trial came to an end also on September 26, 1952 and the only thing which remained to be done thereafter was the pronouncement of the judgment by the learned Presidency Magistrate and that therefore even though the case may be deemed to have been pending before the learned Magistrate there was no occasion for forwarding the same for trial to the Special Judge appointed by the State Government on September 26, 1952. We do not accept this contention. It cannot be denied that on July 28,1952, the date of the commencement of the impugned Act the case of the appellant was pending before the learned Presidency Magistrate. On that day the prosecution had closed its case and S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 693 the appellant had not yet been called upon to enter upon his defence. The examination of the appellant under s. 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure took place after that date. The appellant filed his written statement on August 14, 1952 and the addresses by the prosecution as well as the defence continued right up to September 26, 1952. The word ' pending ' is thus defined in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 3rd Edition, Vol. III, p. 2141: PENDING:-(1) A legal proceeding is 'pending' as soon as commenced and until it is concluded, i.e., so long as the Court having original cognizance of it can make an order on the matters in issue, or to be dealt with, therein. Similar are the observations of Jessel, M. R. In re Clagett's Estate, Fordham v. Clagett (1): ' What is the meaning of the word ' pending ' ? In my opinion, it includes every insolvency in which any proceeding can by any possibility be taken. That I think is the meaning of the word ' pending........... ....................................... A cause is said to be pending in a Court of justice when any proceeding can be taken in it. That is the test.' There is no doubt therefore that the case of the appellant was not concluded and was pending before the learned Presidency Magistrate at the date of the commencement of the impugned Act. We were however told that as many as 40 witnesses had been examined and 226 documents exhibited in the course of the trial before the learned Presidency Magistrate and it could not have been intended by the Legislature when enacting s. 10 of the impugned Act that a case where everything had been finished except the addresses and the pronouncement of the judgment should be forwarded for trial before the Special Judge appointed under the Act. The fallacy underlying this argument is that on July 28, 1952, when the impugned Act. came into, operation the trial even in the restricted sense of the term had not been concluded. The prosecution had closed its case but the appellant had yet to enter upon his defence and lead evidence, if-any, in reply to the case set up by the prosecution. The same was the position even on September 26, 1952, when by a notification in the Official Gazette the Special Judge was appointed having jurisdiction over such cases. The notification came into operation from the commencement of September 26, 1952, which was immediately after the mid- night of September 25, 1952 and the defence address had not concluded by this time but was continued when the learned Presidency Magistrate's Court assembled at 11 a. m. on September 26, 1952 and was concluded thereafter. The word ' trial ' is also defined in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 3rd Edition, Vol. IV, at page 3092: TRIAL: (1) A 'trial' is the conclusion, by a competent tribunal, of questions in issue in legal proceedings whether civil or criminal. (2) The ' trial ' (Criminal Justice Act, 1948 (11 & 12 Geo. 6. C. 58) s. 23 (1) is not complete until sentence has been passed or the offender has been ordered to be discharged (R. v. Grant (1951) 1 K. B. 500). The trial of the appellant therefore could not be said to have been concluded on July 28, 1952 and even on the September 26, 1952, assuming for the sake of argument that the effective commencement of the impugned Act could not be said to have come about until the Special Judge was appointed by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette. This contention of the appellant therefore is in any event devoid of substance. We are aware that in cases like the present one, the provisions contained in S. 10 of the impugned Act would work to the prejudice of the appellant in that he would be subjected to a re-trial before the Special Judge having jurisdiction over the case involving a re-hearing of the whole case with 40 witnesses to be examined and 226 documents to be exhibited. The time which would have to be spent, the anxiety which the appellant would have to undergo, the expenses which he would have to make in the matter of his defence by competent counsel and the possibility which he would have to face of the Special Judge trying the same coming to a conclusion different from the one which was reached by the learned Presidency Magistrate are all considerations which would have made us consider his case very sympathetically and try to find out ways and means whereby he would be saved these troubles and tribulations. The words of s. 10 of the impugned Act however are very clear and categorical and are not capable of being construed in any other manner except that all cases triable by the Special Judges which were pending immediately before the commencement of the impugned Act before any magistrate must be forwarded for trial to the Special Judge having jurisdiction over such cases, the magistrates having cognizance of the same and trying them being divested of jurisdiction to proceed further with the trial thereof immediately after the commencement of the Act. The only persons who were invested with jurisdiction to try these cases after the commencement of the impugned Act were the Special Judges having jurisdiction over the same and whatever was done by the magistrates thereafter was without jurisdiction and void. The case of the appellant is unfortunate. For ought we know the Special Judge trying him would acquit him of the offence with which he has been charged in the same manner as the learned Presidency Magistrate himself did, but there is no escape from the fact that he will have to face a re-trial and undergo the expenses and anxiety in defending himself over again. We have therefore come to the conclusion that the order for re-trial of the appellant made by the High Court was correct and the appeal must be dismissed. We hope and trust that the re-trial before the Special Judge will be conducted with all possible dispatch and the trial will be concluded as early as possible. The appeal will accordingly stand dismissed. Appeal dismissed.",

          "judgement": "DIPANKAR DATTA, J. Leave granted. 2. Based on a complaint lodged by the second respondent, Thanesar city Police Station FIR No.658 dated 2nd August, 2020 was registered under sections 406, 420, 506 and 120B, Indian Penal Code (“IPC”, hereafter) against 7 (seven) accused which, inter alia, included the petitioner. 3. Investigation of the FIR culminated in submission of a police report dated 14th February, 2022 in terms of section 173(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“Cr. PC”, hereafter) under sections 420, 406, 506, 379, 120B and 180 of the IPC, inter alia, against the petitioner. 4. Perusal of the charge-sheet, however, does not reveal any role of the petitioner in respect of the offence under section 379 of the IPC which was added in the FIR, on the complaint of the second respondent, as far back as on 4th August, 2020. 5. To put it briefly, the FIR stems from allegations levelled by the second respondent of she being allured by the principal accused (who happens to be the sister of the petitioner) to part with Rs. 45 lakh in all (paid partly in cash and partly by RTGS) for the purpose of establishment of a pharma company which would be engaged in the manufacture of Ayurvedic medicines. Mainly, allegations of cheating and of fraud practiced on her have been levelled by the second respondent against the principal accused, her husband and various other co-accused. It was also alleged that all the accused including the petitioner had assured the second respondent, with the objective of carrying out the criminal conspiracy, that the principal accused was a very hard working and business savvy woman. Insofar as the role of the petitioner is concerned, the second respondent alleged that the petitioner was introduced to her by the principal accused and that she is a member of the gang which cheated and defrauded her. Apart from the above, the FIR contains no other allegation against the petitioner; otherwise, it is replete with allegations levelled against the principal accused, her husband and the other co-accused. 6. We have noticed that the charge-sheet that came to be submitted before the criminal court does not also specify with clarity the role of the petitioner in either cheating or defrauding the second respondent but refers to her, at best, as a conspirator. What is also highlighted in the charge-sheet is that after securing anticipatory bail, the petitioner had joined the investigation on 30th July, 2021 and in course thereof she had made a confessional statement which, ultimately, she declined to sign; hence, she was also charged for having committed an offence punishable under section 180 of the IPC. 7. Upon the charge-sheet being received, the criminal court took cognizance of the offence and thereafter charges were framed against the accused by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kurukshetra (“CJM”, hereafter) by an order dated 18th July, 2022. Such order was challenged by the petitioner under section 397, Cr. PC. The Additional Sessions Judge, Kurukshetra, (“ASJ”, hereafter), by an order dated 27th September, 2022, dismissed the revision as lacking in merit. 8. At this stage, the High Court’s jurisdiction under section 482, Cr. PC was invoked by the petitioner subjecting the charge-sheet dated 14th February, 2022, the order of the CJM framing charges dated 18th July, 2022 and the revisional order of the ASJ 27th September, 2022 to challenge. The High Court referred to various judicial precedents outlining the contours of exercise of jurisdiction by the high courts while they are approached for quashing an FIR / a complaint and / or criminal proceedings. Relying on such precedents and based on formation of opinion that there was sufficient material found against the petitioner in course of investigation, the High Court by its impugned judgment and order dated 11th November, 2022 spurned the challenge and declined interference resulting in dismissal of the proceedings initiated by the petitioner. 9. Aggrieved thereby, the unsuccessful petitioner before the High Court is in appeal before us. 10. We have heard the parties as well as perused the charge-sheet and the other materials on record. 11. The charge-sheet sets out the contents of the FIR and refers to the materials that were collected in course of investigation. The Investigating Officer obtained the Call Details Record (CDR) and Customer Acquisition Form (CAF) of the cell phones of the second respondent and the petitioner and had also attempted to obtain certificate under section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act by approaching the relevant service providers but failed in his attempt. He was informed that the conversations were quite old, hence, the requisite certificate could not be issued. The charge-sheet also recorded that the principal accused and the co-accused were yet to be arrested and after their arrest, separate supplementary challan would be prepared and presented before the court; nevertheless, sufficient evidence on the file to prepare challan against the petitioner was available. 12. In the course of hearing of this appeal, the petitioner sought for and was granted permission to file additional documents. Soon thereafter, the first respondent / State filed a reply affidavit dated 24th April, 2023. 13. The application for additional documents contains several documents. The first purports to be the translated copy of an agreement dated 23rd June, 2020 entered into by and between the principal accused and the second respondent in the presence of two witnesses, whereby the principal accused undertook responsibility of the entire amount (Rs. 45 lakh) received by her from the second respondent and also promised to refund to the second respondent the entire amount if, for any reason, the work to set up the proposed company did not materialize. The second document is purportedly a statement of even date (23rd June, 2020) made by the principal accused undertaking to pay Rs. 47 lakh, which she had received for business purpose from the second respondent, to the latter within a year from date. The third document also purports to be the true translation of a statement of the principal accused admitting that there were discussions with the second respondent to promote and set up an ayurvedic factory for which the parties met several times and that the principal accused received such amount of money as indicated therein. 14. All these documents which the petitioner seeks to rely on, if genuine, could be helpful for her defence at the trial but the same are not material at the stage of deciding whether quashing as prayed by her before the High Court was warranted or not. We, therefore, see no reason to place any reliance on these three documents. 15. The fourth document which has been brought on record in support of the petitioner’s claim for quashing of the proceedings against her is the statement of the second respondent under section 161 of the Cr. PC. Therein, inter alia, it was stated by the second respondent that Rs. 9.50 lakh was paid in cash by her to the principal accused at a particular house (House No. 620 in Sector-4, Kurukshetra) where the principal accused, the petitioner and their mother were present and that on receipt of such sum of money in cash, “those” (meaning thereby the principal accused, the petitioner and their mother) … “counted the money” which was ultimately kept with the principal accused. This, the second respondent said, happened in the presence of her sister-in-law, Indu. It was also said by the second respondent in such statement that the principal accused, her husband, the petitioner and the other accused together have cheated her in a sum of Rs. 45 lakh in the manner described therein. 16. The charge-sheet contains a list of 27 (twenty-seven) witnesses who are proposed to be examined by the prosecution in support of the charges framed against several accused including the petitioner. Apart from the second respondent and others, this particular list includes Indu, the sister-in-law of the second respondent, who is said to have been present at House No. 620 when allegedly the money changed hands. 17. This is a case where the charges have been framed and the accused are awaiting trial. Having regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances, noticed above, we are of the considered opinion that the investigation and the follow-up steps are not so patently and unobtrusively defective or erroneous (except to the extent we propose to mention before concluding our judgment) that allowing the trial to progress might cause a miscarriage of justice. This is also not an appropriate stage to delve deep into the records. It is no part of the business of any of the courts to ascertain what the outcome of the trial could be, ~ conviction or acquittal of the accused. The small window that the law, through judicial precedents, provides is to look at the allegations in the FIR and the materials collected in course of investigation, without a rebuttal thereof by the accused, and to form an opinion upon consideration thereof that an offence is indeed not disclosed from it. Unless the prosecution is shown to be illegitimate so as to result in an abuse of the process of law, it would not be proper to scuttle it. The principles to be borne in mind with regard to quashing of a charge / proceedings either in exercise of jurisdiction under section 397, Cr. PC or section 482, Cr. PC or together, as the case may be, has engaged the attention of this Court many a time. Reference to each and every precedent is unnecessary. However, we may profitably refer to only one decision of this Court where upon a survey of almost all the precedents on the point, the principles have been summarized by this Court succinctly. In Amit Kapoor vs. Ramesh Chandra, this Court laid down the following guiding principles: “27.1. Though there are no limits of the powers of the Court under Section 482 of the Code but the more the power, the more due care and caution is to be exercised in invoking these powers. The power of quashing criminal proceedings, particularly, the charge framed in terms of Section 228 of the Code should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases. 27.2. The Court should apply the test as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made from the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith prima facie establish the offence or not. If the allegations are so patently absurd and inherently improbable that no prudent person can ever reach such a conclusion and where the basic ingredients of a criminal offence are not satisfied then the Court may interfere. 27.3. The High Court should not unduly interfere. No meticulous examination of the evidence is needed for considering whether the case would end in conviction or not at the stage of framing of charge or quashing of charge. 27.4. Where the exercise of such power is absolutely essential to prevent patent miscarriage of justice and for correcting some grave error that might be committed by the subordinate courts even in such cases, the High Court should be loath to interfere, at the threshold, to throttle the prosecution in exercise of its inherent powers. 1 (2012) 9 SCC 460 27.5. Where there is an express legal bar enacted in any of the provisions of the Code or any specific law in force to the very initiation or institution and continuance of such criminal proceedings, such a bar is intended to provide specific protection to an accused. 27.6. The Court has a duty to balance the freedom of a person and the right of the complainant or prosecution to investigate and prosecute the offender. 27.7. The process of the court cannot be permitted to be used for an oblique or ultimate/ulterior purpose. 27.8. Where the allegations made and as they appeared from the record and documents annexed therewith to predominantly give rise and constitute a ‘civil wrong’ with no ‘element of criminality’ and does not satisfy the basic ingredients of a criminal offence, the court may be justified in quashing the charge. Even in such cases, the court would not embark upon the critical analysis of the evidence. 27.9. Another very significant caution that the courts have to observe is that it cannot examine the facts, evidence and materials on record to determine whether there is sufficient material on the basis of which the case would end in a conviction; the court is concerned primarily with the allegations taken as a whole whether they will constitute an offence and, if so, is it an abuse of the process of court leading to injustice. 27.10. It is neither necessary nor is the court called upon to hold a full-fledged enquiry or to appreciate evidence collected by the investigating agencies to find out whether it is a case of acquittal or conviction. 27.11. Where allegations give rise to a civil claim and also amount to an offence, merely because a civil claim is maintainable, does not mean that a criminal complaint cannot be maintained. 27.12. In exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 228 and/or under Section 482, the Court cannot take into consideration external materials given by an accused for reaching the conclusion that no offence was disclosed or that there was possibility of his acquittal. The Court has to consider the record and documents annexed therewith by the prosecution. 27.13. Quashing of a charge is an exception to the rule of continuous prosecution. Where the offence is even broadly satisfied, the Court should be more inclined to permit continuation of prosecution rather than its quashing at that initial stage. The Court is not expected to marshal the records with a view to decide admissibility and reliability of the documents or records but is an opinion formed prima facie. 27.14. Where the charge-sheet, report under Section 173(2) of the Code, suffers from fundamental legal defects, the Court may be well within its jurisdiction to frame a charge. 27.15. Coupled with any or all of the above, where the Court finds that it would amount to abuse of process of the Code or that the interest of justice favours, otherwise it may quash the charge. The power is to be exercised ex debito justitiae i.e. to do real and substantial justice for administration of which alone, the courts exist. *** 27.16. These are the principles which individually and preferably cumulatively (one or more) be taken into consideration as precepts to exercise of extraordinary and wide plenitude and jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code by the High Court. Where the factual foundation for an offence has been laid down, the courts should be reluctant and should not hasten to quash the proceedings even on the premise that one or two ingredients have not been stated or do not appear to be satisfied if there is substantial compliance with the requirements of the offence.” 18. Applying the broad principles as enunciated by this Court, we hold that it is not one of those rare cases where the uncontroverted allegations appearing from the materials on record notwithstanding, it can successfully be contended that even no prima facie opinion can be formed pointing to commission of any offence by the petitioner. It is trite that the conspiracy to commit an offence is by itself distinct from the offence to do which the conspiracy is entered into and that such an offence, if actually committed, would be the subject-matter of a separate charge. The allegations that the petitioner was found counting the cash received by the principal accused from the second respondent in the presence of a listed witness and that she conspired with her sister, the principal accused, to cheat and defraud the second respondent, persuade us to record that involvement of the petitioner, howsoever limited, cannot be ruled out at this stage and, therefore, the trial ought to be permitted to proceed and she obliged to stand trial. 19. For the reasons aforesaid, we uphold the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dismissing the petition under section 482, Cr. PC. The trial court may proceed with the trial uninfluenced by any observation made in this judgment and order which is for the purpose of a decision on the appeal. 20. Before parting, we consider it necessary to advert to one aspect which though not referred to by the parties to us has been noticed from the reply affidavit of the first respondent / State. 21. The deponent of such reply affidavit happens to be holding the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police (“DSP”, hereafter). He has, in paragraph 5 thereof, audaciously averred as follows: “It is further submitted that present petitioner recorded her confession statement dated 30.07.2021 in which she admitted to the fact that she had met the complainant along with other accused persons and received a sum of Rs. 9 Lakhs from the complainant, which was later handed over to her sister & co-accused Priyanka Mittal. She further admitted that she received a sum of Rs. 2 Lakhs as her share which she had spent on personal expenses. It is pertinent to mention that after getting her statement dated 30.07.2021 recorded, petitioner refused to sign her statement for which she was also charge sheeted for commission of an offence under section 180 IPC.” 22. We are aghast to note that an officer of the rank of DSP could be so irresponsible while swearing an affidavit which is proposed to be filed before this Court. An officer, who is a DSP, ought to know that in terms of section 162, Cr. PC, no statement made by a person to a police officer in the course of any investigation under Chapter XII of the Cr. PC, which is reduced to writing, is required to be signed by the person making the statement and that section 180 of the IPC gets attracted only if a statement is refused to be signed which a public servant is legally competent to require the person making the statement to sign. That is not the case here. Since the deponent has not been heard by us, we do not propose to take the issue further but warn him to be cautious in future. 23. It does not appear from the order dated 18th July, 2022 of the CJM that any charge has been framed against the petitioner under section 180 of the IPC; however, if any charge thereunder by any separate order has been framed against the petitioner, she will be at liberty to pursue her remedy in accordance with law. 24. Except to the extent mentioned above, the appeal stands dismissed without any order for costs. 25. A copy of this judgment shall be forwarded by the Registry to the Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh not for the purpose of initiating any action adverse to the interest of the deponent of the reply affidavit but for the purpose of ensuring that police officers at all levels are made aware of the legal provisions and the impact that ignorance of legal provisions could have on pending criminal proceedings adversely affecting the rights of accused, so that there is no recurrence of similar such incident. …………………………………J (S.

          "judgement": "CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 205 of 1956. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 30th November, 1955, of the Punjab High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 282 of 1955, arising out of the judgment and order dated the 15th February, 1955, of the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge at Amritsar in Sessions Case No. R. L. Anand, and S. N. Anand, for the appellant. Kartar Singh Chawla, Assistant Advocate-General, for the State of Punjab and T. M. Sen, for the respondent. 1957. September 17. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-This is an appeal against the judgment and order of the Punjab High Court reversing an order of acquittal by the Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar. The appellant Bakshish Singh and his brother Gurbakshi Singh were tried for an offence under ss. 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code but were acquitted. Against this judgment the State took an appeal to the High Court. As Gurbaksh Singh was said to be absconding the appeal against the appellant alone was heard and decided by the High Court. On August 1, 1954, sometime between 7 and 8 p.m Bachhinder Singh son of Bhagwan Singh of village Kairon was shot in the lane in front of their house and as a result of bullet injuries he died the next day in the hospital at Amritsar. He was at the time of shooting accompanied by his younger brother Narvel Singh, a boy of 13, and after getting injured Bachhinder Singh and his brother returned to the house. Bhagwan Singh states that he was informed of the identity of the assailants by Bachhinder Singh who was, at his own request, carried from the house to the hospital at Kairon but as the injuries were serious the doctor at Kairon rendered 'first aid' and advised the father to take his son to V. J. Hospital at Amritsar. Bhagwan Singh then took Bachhinder Singh to the Railway Station but before the arrival of the train he went to the Police Post at Kairon which is at a distance of about 100 yds. from the Railway Station in order to make a report. As the Assistant Sub Inspector was away at Sarhali, he returned to the Railway Station and took his son to the Amritsar hospital by the train leaving Kairon at 9-47 p.m. Bhagwan Singh was accompanied at that time by his younger son, Narvel Singh, P.W. 12, and by Shamir Singh, Inder Singh and Narinjan Singh. Soon after their arrival at the Amritsar hospital Bachhinder Singh was examined by Dr. Kanwal Kishore, P.W. 2, at 11-45 p.m. and finding the injury to be of a serious nature the doctor sent information to the Police as a result of which Head Constable Maya Ram Sharma, P.W. 4, arrived at the hospital sometime after midnight and, in the presence of Dr. Mahavir Sud, P.W. 17, recorded the dying declaration of Bachhinder Singh, Exhibit P-H, after getting a certificate from the doctor that the injured person was in a fit state to make a statement. This statement is the basis of the First Information Report, Exhibit P-H. 1, which is a copy of Exhibit P-H. This report was recorded on August 2, 1954, at 7-50 a.m. at Police Station Sarhali which, we were told, is about 20 miles or so away from Amritsar. In the early hours of the morning Dr. K. C. Saronwala P.W. I performed an operation on Bachhinder Singh and extracted a bullet from the left abdominal wall which was handed over to the Police. But Bachhinder Singh died at 1-35 p.m. on August 2, 1954. An inquest report Exhibit P-K was prepared at 2-30 p.m. by Head Constable Maya Ram, P.W. 4. The case for the prosecution rests on the dying declaration of Bachhinder Singh, Ex. P-H, and on the statement of Narvel Singh, P.W. 12, who was an eye witness to the occurrence and on the statement made by the deceased to his father as to his assailant as soon as he (Bachhinder Singh) was brought to the house after receiving the injuries. The prosecution also relied on an extra-judicial confession made to Teja Singh, P.W. 13, but both the courts below have rejected this piece of evidence and it is unnecessary to consider it any further. The learned Additional Sessions Judge rejected the dying declaration made by Bachhinder Singh on two grounds; that at the time of recording the dying declaration not only Bhagwan Singh, the father, and Narvel Singh, the brother of Bachhinder Singh, were present but the police officer had actually made enquiries from them about the occurrence before he proceeded to record the dying declaration of Bachhinder Singh deceased. Head Constable Maya Ram, P.W. 4, has admitted in cross-examination that Bachhinder Singh gave his statement in Punjabi but the form and the detailed account given in the statement, Exhibit P-H, would show that it was not the product of Bachhinder Singh's creation alone but it was a 'touched up' declaration of the deceased. It is laid down in 1954 Lahore 805 that a dying declaration which records the very words of the dying man unassisted by interested persons is most valuable evidence but the value of a dying declaration altogether disappears when parts of it had obviously been supplied to the dead man by other persons whether interested or Police Officer. As the dying declaration, Exhibit P-H, in this case cannot be regarded as the creation of Bachhinder Singh deceased, no reliance whatsoever can be placed on it and it could not form the basis for the conviction of any of the accused. The learned Judges of the High Court did not agree with this criticism. Birhan Narain J., who delivered the main judgment, said: 'This criticism appears to me to be without any substance. The statement was recorded by Head Constable Maya Ram who was posted in Amritsar and was not posted in village Kairon and therefore had no knowledge of the parties nor had any interest in them Thus there was no reason why he should record the statement falsely or irregularly. Throughout the time that the statement was recorded Dr. Mahavir Sud of the Amritsar hospital was present. He has appeared as P.W. 17 in the present case. He is a respectable and disinterested person and he is positive in his testimony before the court that the statement was made by the deceased voluntarily and that there was nobody present to prompt him. He has further stated that he did not allow any person to be present at that time. There is absolutely no reason for doubting the correctness of this statement................. Coming to the other objection of the Additional Sessions Judge, it is difficult to understand the significance attached by him to the fact that the deceased spoke in Punjabi while the statement was recorded by Maya Ram in Urdu. The court language is Urdu and the Police generally records statements in Urdu even if they are made in the Punjabi language. I have no doubt in my mind that the dying declaration recorded in the present case is a voluntary one and was made without any prompting from anybody.' The High Court in our opinion correctly appreciated the evidence and was right in accepting the authenticity of the dying declaration. The statement of Maya Ram, P. W. 4, does not support the criticism of the learned trial judge. And he had read more in the statement of Narvel Singh, P. W. 12, made before the Committing Magistrate, than it really contains. It is unfortunate that the criticism has proceeded on the English record of the Magistrate's Court which does not appear to have been correctly recorded as the Urdu record is in many parts materially different. The fact that the statement contained in Exhibit P-H was made without any prompting is also supported by the testimony of a wholly disinterested witness, Dr. Mahavir Sud, whose statement made before the Committing Magistrate was transferred at the trial stage under s. 33 of the Evidence Act. He stated: 'The statement of Bachhinder Singh was voluntary and there was none to prompt it. I did not allow any attendant on Bachhinder Singh then.' In cross-examination he made it clearer that there was no relation or friend of the deceased person when the statement was recorded. Some criticism was levelled against the dying declaration based on a sentence in the statement of Dr. Mahavir Sud P. W. 17 that the Head Constable put certain questions to clarify the ambiguities and these questions and answers do not find place in Exhibit P-H, the record of the dying declaration. No such question was put to the Head Constable who recorded the statement. The Head Constable stated that the dying declaration was written at the declarant's own dictation without any addition or omission. In cross-examination nothing was asked as to any questions having been put to the deceased by this witness. Therein the witness also stated: 'It is not correct that I first made the inquiry from the father of the deceased and other persons before I proceeded to record his statement.' He also made it clear that before he allowed the statement to be made he satisfied himself that Bachhinder Singh was in a fit state to make the statement. We are of the opinion that the High Court rightly held the dying declaration to be a statement made by the deceased unaided by any outside agency and without prompting by anybody. The declarant was free from any outside influence in making his statement. Another reason given by the Additional Sessions Judge for rejecting the dying declaration was that the deceased gave the narrative of events in Punjabi and the statement was taken down in Urdu. In the Punjab that is how the dying declarations are taken down and that has been so ever since the courts were established and judicial authority has never held that to be an infirmity in dying declarations making them inefficacious. As a matter of fact in the Punjab the language used in the subordinate courts and that employed by the Police for recording of statements has always been Urdu and the recording of the dying declaration in Urdu cannot be a ground for saying that the statement does not correctly reproduce what was stated by the declarant. This, in our opinion, was a wholly inadequate reason for rejecting the dying declaration. Exhibit P-H, the dying declaration, is a long document and is a narrative of a large number of incidents which happened before the actual assault. Such long statements which are more in the nature of First Information Reports than recital of the cause of death or circumstances resulting in it are likely to give the impression of their being not genuine or not having been made unaided and without prompting. The dying declaration is the statement made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death and such details which fall outside the ambit of this are not strictly within the permissible limits laid down by s. 32 (1) of the Evidence Act and unless absolutely necessary to make a statement coherent or complete should not be included in the statement. We are informed that, in the Punjab, no rules have been made in regard to the recording of dying declarations which, we are told, has been done in several other States. We think it would be desirable if some such rules were framed and included in the Rules and Orders made by the High Court for the guidance of persons recording dying declarations. Of course the authenticity of the dying declaration has to be judged in accordance with the circumstances of each case depending upon many factors which would vary with each case but those recording such statements would be well advised to keep in view the fact that the object of a dying declaration is to get from the person making the statement the cause of death or the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in death. The admissibility of the statement of Dr. Mahavir Sud was assailed by counsel for the appellant on the ground that the conditions laid down for the admissibility of statements under s. 33 had not been complied with and several decided cases were relied upon. This question does not seem to have been raised at any previous stage of the proceedings, neither before the Additional Sessions Judge nor before the High Court, and this criticism seems to be without much substance. At the trial the prosecution produced Foot Constable Kartar Singh, P. W. 14, who deposed that he took the summons for this witness to the hospital where he was previously employed and the Superintendent of the hospital made a report that he was no longer in service and it was not known where he was. This witness also stated that 'from the inquiries made by me, I learnt that his whereabouts are not known.' In cross-examination he again stated that he made inquiries but he could not discover the whereabouts of this witness. After the statement of Kartar Singh, P. W. 14, the Public Prosecutor made a statement that Dr. Mahavir Sud's whereabouts were not known and prayed that his statement be transferred under s. 33 of the Evidence Act on the ground that there was no likelihood of the witness being available without unreasonable delay and expense and no objection is shown to have been taken by the defence at that stage. Thereupon the learned trial judge ordered the statement to be transferred under s. 33 of the Evidence Act. He might have been well advised to give fuller reasons for making the order transferring the statement. It appears to us that the learned judge transferred it on the ground of unreasonable delay and expense and we do not find any infirmity in this order of transfer. Counsel then contended that for the efficacy of the dying declaration, corroboration was essential. In the present case there is the statement of Narvel Singh, P. W. 12, who is an eye witness to the occurrence which is relied upon by the prosecution as corroboration of the dying declaration. The learned Additional Sessions Judge rejected the testimony of this witness on the ground that there were discrepancies between his statement made in the commitment proceedings and at the trial. We have already pointed out that the cross-examination of this witness was based on somewhat inaccurate English record of his statement in the Committing Court, the statement in Urdu record puts a different complexion on it. But even if this were not so the High Court, in our opinion, has taken a correct view of the testimony of this witness and has accepted it for cogent reasons. Besides Narvel Singh there is the statement of Bhagwan Singh, the father, who stated that as soon as Bachhinder Singh came into the house he mentioned the names of his assailants to him. The incident took place just outside the house of Bhagwan Singh and it was never disputed that he was present in the house when the incident took place. It is only natural that as soon as the injured son came into the house he would be asked as to who had injured him or would himself state who had caused him the injury. He was in his senses at that time and no reason has been suggested why the son would not disclose to his father the names of his assailants. There is no adequate reason for rejecting this portion of the testimony of Bhagwan Singh and merely because the dying declaration does not mention it, is hardly a reason for not accepting it. The non-production of Sucha Singh who is stated in the dying declaration and in the statement of Narvel Singh, P.W. 12, to have witnessed the occurrence was commented upon by counsel as a very serious omission. The Public Prosecutor stated at the trial that he was giving up Sucha Singh as he had been won over. Therefore, if produced, Sucha Singh would have been no better than a suborned witness. He was not a witness 'essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution was based' and if examined the result would have been confusion, because the prosecution would have automatically proceeded to discredit him by cross-examination. No oblique reason for his non-production was alleged, least of all proved. There was, therefore, no obligation on the part of the prosecution to examine this witness: See Abdul Mohammad v. Attorney General of Palestine (1); Stephen Servaratne v. The King (1); Habeeb Mohammad v. The State of Hyderabad (3). In the circumstances the court would not interfere with the discretion of the prosecutor as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution and no adverse inference under s. 114 of the Evidence Act can be drawn against the State. The High Court, in our opinion, have kept in view correct principles governing appeals against acquittals and have rightly applied them to the circumstances of this case. The erroneous view that the learned Sessions Judge took of the dying declaration and of the oral evidence were compelling enough reasons for the reversal of that judgment. We therefore dismiss this appeal. Appeal dismissed.",
