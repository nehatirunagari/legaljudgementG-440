Jha for the Appellants.\nS.N. Kacker and L.R. Singh for the Respondents.\nVijay Hansaria for Respondent in C.A. No. 2248/85.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by KHALID, J.\nIn these appeals, by special leave, the short question that falls for decision is as to how Explanation to Section 2(P)(i) inserted by the Bihar Agricultural Produce Markets (Amendment) Act, 1982, should be read with the Explanation to Section 27 also inserted by the same Act.\nBefore the High Court, the vires of Explanation to Section 2(P)(i) was challenged on the ground that it encroached upon Entry 42 of list I of the Seventh Schedule.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court after considering the various au thorities dealing with the concept of sale, refrained from declaring the Explanation bad but read it down and held that it should be read in harmony with the Explanation to Section 27 and directed the marketing committee concerned to make assessment of fees after giving the petitioners an opportu nity as provided in the Explanation to Section 27.\nIn this Judgment, we do not propose to go into the question whether sale as explained in the Explanation to Section 2(P)(i)) would include interstate trade etc.\nand on that reasoning strike down the Explanation.\nWe propose to consider the scope of the two Explanations to see whether they can co exist.\nThe Original Act was called the Bihar Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1960, (for short the Act).\nThis Act was enacted to regulate the buying and selling of crops by providing suitable and regulated markets, to eliminate middlemen and to help the cultivators and the buyers in the disposal of the commodities.\nThe Act enabled the marketing committee to levy a fee for transactions talking place in the market area.\nTo get at persons who manage to escape the levy of market fee by ingenious transactions, the Act was amended by inserting a new definition Section 2(P)(i) along with an Explanation and also adding an Explanation to Sec tion 27.\nWhat we have to decide in this case is as to how these two Explanations have to be construed.\nIn other words whether one Explanation excludes the other or whether one is the compliment of the other.\n213 It is necessary first to quote the two provisions under consideration.\nSection 2(P)(i) along with the Explanation reads as follows: \"2(P)(i) 'Sale ' means any transfer of proper ty in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration and shall include transfer or acquisition of goods on hire purchase or under any other system in which payment of valuable consideration is made by installment notwithstanding the fact that the seller retains title in goods as valuable security of payment of consideration or for any other person.\nExplanation Notwithstanding any thing contained in any law for the time being in force sale shall be deemed to have taken place for the purpose of this Act within a market area when the goods are transferred from the Principal to his selling agent or to the Arhatia within the market area or outside the market area.\"\nSection 27 is the charging section.\nIt reads as follows along with the Explanation: \"Section 27 Power to levy fees (1) The market committee shall levy and collect market fees on the agricultural produce brought or sold in the market area, at the rate of rupee one per Rs. 100 worth of agricultural produce.\nExplanation: All notified agricultural produce leaving a market area, shall unless the con trary is proved be presumed to have been bought or sold in such area.\"\nIn fiscal laws due importance has to be given to the phraseology used in the charging section.\nSection 27 gives to the market committee the power to levy and collect market fees on the agricultural produce bought or sold in the market area at the rate given therein.\nThe Explanation raises a presumption and that is that all notified agricul tural produce leaving a market area shall be presumed to have been bought or sold in such an area.\nBut this presump tion is rebuttable because the Explanation gives the affect ed party an opportunity to satisfy the assessing authorities that there was neither buying nor selling in a given case.\nThis Section with its Explanation thus creates no difficul ty.\nIt is 214 when we come to the definition section, extracted above, that the difficulty arises. 'Sale ' is defined in Section 2(P)(i).\nIf the definition had stopped there, there would have been no difficulty in construing Section 27 and its Explanation.\nIn all transactions the parties get an opportu nity to satisfy the assessing authorities whether such transactions are sales or not.\nBut the Explanation to Sec tion 2(P)(i) introduces complications.\nThis Explanation states by a deeming fiction, that when goods are transferred from the principal to his selling agent or Arhatia within a market area or outside the market area a sale takes place.\nThis Explanation encompasses within its sweep, sales of all kinds within the market area or outside or within the State or outside.\nThat is the reason why its validity was chal lenged by the respondents before the High Court.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants contended that the Explanation to Section 2(P)(i) could stand independent of the Explanation to Section 27 since they have different fields of operation.\nAccording to him, if this Explanation is made subject to the Explanation to Section 27, this Explanation would be rendered redundant and futile.\nThe learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand pleaded that since both the Explanations were brought on the Statute Book by the same amendment, they must be read harmo niously and the Explanation to the definition section should be read subject to the Explanation to the charging section.\nWe have considered the rival contentions carefully.\nWe feel that the Explanation to Section 2(P)(i) has not been well worded nor properly placed.\nWe are steering clear of the contention that the Explanation is in excess of the powers of the State Legislature since we feel that the dispute can be resolved better by allowing the two Explana tions to co exist by reading them harmoniously.\nIn doing so, it is necessary to read down the Explanation to Section 2(P)(i) and give full effect to the Explanation to the charging section.\nThe Explanation to Section 27 gives an opportunity to the affected persons to satisfy the assessing authorities that the transaction in question is not a sale.\nThis Explanation should be deemed to take in all sales including those mentioned in the Explanation to Section 2(P)(i).\nIn other words, even transactions coming within the ambit of Explanation to Section 2(P)(i) have to be governed by the Explanation to Section 27.\nIn construing the two Explanations we have give preference to the Explanation to the charging section over the Explanations to the definition section consistent with the rules of interpretation of such provisions.\nIf that be so, the Judgment of the High Court has to be upheld and these 215 appeals have to be dismissed.\nWe do so.\nAs directed by the High Court the marketing committee concerned can make as sessment of fees only after giving the respondents an oppor tunity to show cause as laid down in the Explanation to Section 27.\nIf the Government wants a stricter control over the transactions in the market area it is for them to suit ably amend the Explanation in question by excluding its operation from the Explanation to Section 27.\nIn the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.\nM.L.A.

                        "judgement": "ition Nos.\r\n829\/79, 1104, 200 2655 of 1980.\r\n(Under article 32 of the Constitution of India).\r\nG. N. Dikshit, section Markendeya, P. Sinha, M. M. Temai, J. K Nayyar and section K Bisaria with him for the Petitioners.\r\nsection R Gambhir for the Respondent.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA REDDY, J.\r\nThe petitioners are nomad graziers of Gujarat and Rajasthan, who wander from place to place with their sheep, goats and cattle in search of pasture and foliage.\r\nBoundaries of States present no barriers to them.\r\nAfter all, to them and to their livestock, it is a question of survival.\r\nIn their wanderings they often pass through the State of Madhya Pradesh en route some times to Uttar Pradesh and some times to Maharashtra.\r\nThis happens particularly in times of drought in Gujarat and Rajasthan The powers that be in the State of Madhya Pradesh became apprehensive that uninhibited passage of large herds of these animals through Madhya Pradesh may lead to large scale devastation of their forest wealth.\r\nSo they hit upon a plan to prevent foreign cattle ' from browsing in Madhya Pradesh forests.\r\nFor the moment, it was forgotten that India is one country and no Indian is a foreigner in any of the constituent States of India.\r\nThe plan was this: The enabled the State Government to make rules to regulate the cutting of grass and pasturing of cattle in protected forests (Sec.\r\n32(i) and, generally, to carry out the provisions of the Act (Sec. 76).\r\nWe may note here 'cattle ' as defined by section 2(i) includes buffaloes, sheep, goats and many other specie of browsing animals.\r\nWe may also note that we are concerned in this case with protected forests only and not reserved forests.\r\nRules had been made earlier by the Madhya Pradesh Government in 1974 called the Madhya 126 Pradesh Grazing Rates Rules, 1974 by which provision was made A for grazing licences, transit grazing licences, grazing rates and other subjects.\r\nRule 4 prohibited grazing in closed coupes, plantation area and such other areas as were declared as closed for grazing by the Divisional Forest officer.\r\nRule 3 provided for the issuance of licences for grazing in particular grazing units, each forest range being treated as a grazing unit till the constitution of such grazing units.\r\nRule S provided for the issuance of transit licences for transit of cattle through Government forests in the State of Madhya Pradesh, so that cattle in transit may not graze continuously for more than a month in a particular grazing unit.\r\nRule 6 prescribed grazing rates, commercial and transit.\r\nFor buffaloes it was Rs. 6 per head per year while for goats and sheep, it was Re. 1 per head per year whether it was for commercial or transit purposes.\r\nRule 7 prescribed grazing rates for 'foreign cattle of adjoining States '.\r\nWhether the cattle grazed in the forest or passed through the forest, Grazing was permitted at the rate of Rs. 10 per head per year in the case of buffaloes and Rs. 2 per head per year in the case of goats and sheep.\r\nIn 1979, the rules made in 1974 were superseded and fresh rules were made.\r\nThey are the rules now in force.\r\nRule 2(5) bans grazing in reserved forests.\r\nRule 3 provides for the issue of grazing licences in grazing units so constituted.\r\nUntil grazing units are constituted, each forest range is to be treated as a separate grazing unit.\r\nRule 3(2) provides for the levy of grazing charges at rates to be notified from time to time.\r\nRule 4 prohibits grazing in closed coupes, plantation areas and other areas which are declared as closed for grazing by the Divisional Forest officer.\r\nRule 5 provides for transit grazing licences, on payment of grazing charges, for the transit of cattle through Government forests where the owners of the cattle are residents of Madhya Pradesh.\r\nCattle in transit, however, are not allowed to graze continuously in the same grazing unit for more than 30 days.\r\nRule 6 enables the Government to notify from time to time the rates of grazing charges and transit grazing charges payable by residents of Madhya Pradesh.\r\nRule 7 provides for the levy of grazing rates for 'foreign cattle of adjoining States '.\r\nThe rule enables the State Government to prohibit, restrict, or in their discretion to grant owners of cattle residing outside the State of Madhya Pradesh grazing or transit grazing facilities for their cattle on payment of charges to be notified from time to time.\r\nRule 7(2) further empowers the Government to specify the specific grazing areas, the points of entry and exit of the route to be followed by the cattle, 127 the period during which grazing or transit grazing should be completed, etc.\r\nOn June 28, 1979, two notifications one, under rule 6 and the other, under rule 7 were issued notifying the rates of charges for the issue of grazing and transit grazing licences.\r\nIn respect of cattle belonging to residents of Madhya Pradesh, the grazing rate is Re. 1 per year for each animal in the case of goats and sheep.\r\nNothing is to be charged in the case of buffaloes.\r\nThe notification issued under rule 7 prescribes the routes to be followed by the cattle of Rajasthan and Gujarat while in transit through the State of Madhya Pradesh.\r\nIt also stipulates that the owners of cattle must take the cattle through the State of Madhya Pradesh within a period of 45 days after the issue of licences.\r\nThe prescribed grazing rates are Rs. 10 per animal in the case of buffaloes and Rs. 5 per animal in the case of sheep and goats.\r\nApparently the Government of Madhya Pradesh wants to inhibit the influx of cattle of other States (described in the rules as 'foreign cattle ') by the method of charging higher grazing rates in their case than in the case of cattle belonging to the residents of Madhya Pradesh, This levy of higher rates, the prescription of the route to be followed by foreign cattle while in transit through Madhya Pradesh and the stipulation that the cattle must leave Madhya Pradesh in 45 days are questioned in these writ petitions.\r\nIt is contended that the petitioner 's Fundamental Rights under article 14 and article 19 (e) (f ) and (g) and the right under article 301 are contravened.\r\nOn the other hand, it is contended on behalf of State of Madhya Pradesh that the rules prescribing grazing rates for 'foreign cattle; the route to be followed by 'foreign cattle ' while in transit through Madhya Pradesh and the period for which 'foreign cattle ' may remain within the boundaries of the State of Madhya Pradesh are made to regulate the influx and passage of 'foreign cattle ' into and through Madhya Pradesh with a view to prevent devastation and to protect the forest wealth of State.\r\nWe are unable to see any rational basis for the distinction made between owners of cattle belonging to Madhya Pradesh and owners of cattle belonging to other States (described as owners of 'foreign cattle ') and the levy of prohibited grazing rates on owners of the so called 'foreign cattle '.\r\nForests of Madhya Pradesh are not grazing grounds reserved for cattle belonging to residents of Madhya Pradesh only even as the towns and villages of Madhya Pradesh cannot be reserved for the residents of the original residents 128 of Madhya Pradesh only.\r\nAccidents of birth and geography cannot A furnish the credentials for such discrimination and authorise prejudicial treatment in matters of this nature.\r\nWe do not say that geographical classification is never permissible.\r\nFor example, a preference given by a State to its residents ill the matter of admission to educational institutions maintained by the State from its revenues may be well justified.\r\nBut we are unable to see any such justification for the levy of virtually penal grazing charges in the case of owners of cattle belonging to other States.\r\nThe only attempt at justification is that the influx of 'foreign cattle ' is resulting in the destruction of the forest wealth of the State.\r\nIt is difficult to understand this justification.\r\nIf cattle belonging to residents of Madhya Pradesh are allowed to graze, will it not lead to the same damage as by the cattle belonging to persons of other States ? Surely, it cannot be that the Madhya Pradesh cattle are less destructive than the cattle belonging to persons of other States.\r\nFurther if the object was to prevent all cattle from grazing in protected forests, such grazing could have been banned as in the case of reserved forests.\r\nEven in the case of the so called foreign cattle, cattle belonging to owners who are rich, may yet have their cattle graze in the Madhya Pradesh forests but not cattle belonging to poorer graziers.\r\nFurther, subject to reasonable restrictions which may be imposed in the interests of the general public, a citizen has the right under our Constitution to move freely throughout the territory of India, to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India and to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation trade or business.\r\nGraziers, be they of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat or Rajashthan, therefore, have the right to pass and repass through the State of Madhya Pradesh with their cattle in the pursuit of their occupation.\r\nThe right is, of course, subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public.\r\nWe are enable to discover any reasonable basis for classifying graziers into those belonging to Madhya Pradesh and those belonging to other States; nor are we able to discover any acceptable reason behind the restriction imposed on graziers of other States by the heavier charge made on them.\r\nWe are convinced that their is no justification whatsoever for charging higher grazing rates for cattle belonging to persons of other States.\r\nIn regard to the prescription of the route along which the cattle have to be taken while in transit, however we find nothing wrong with it, since the object is obviously to prevent cattle straying and causing indiscriminate damage to forests.\r\nWe are, however, unable to justify the ceiling of 45 days in which cattle must pass through the State of Madhya Pradesh.\r\nIn the case of 129 cattle belonging to residents of Madhya Pradesh, the grazing rate is levied for a period of one year.\r\nThere is no reason why the charge A should be levied for 45 days in the case of persons belonging to other States.\r\nThe apprehension that cattle, if allowed to graze in the same place for a long time, may destroy the pasture and foliage altogether is taken care of by the other rules which prescribe that the cattle may not graze in the same grazing unit for more than a month.\r\nIn the circumstances, we quash the levy of higher grazing rates in the case of cattle belonging to persons of States other than Madhya Pradesh and direct the respondents to levy the same rates as they do in the case of cattle belonging to residents of Madhya Pradesh.\r\nThe limit of stay of 45 days is also declared unconstitutional.\r\nThe writ petitions are allowed accordingly.\r\nThe petitioners will get their costs.",

Chitale, Ms. M. Ray and H.K. Dutt for the Appel lant.\r\nV.C. Mahajan, (N.P.), P. Parmeshwaran and R.P. Srivasta va for the Respondents.\r\nK .R. Nambiar for the Intervener.\r\n372 The Order of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN J.\r\nThe appellant assessee manufactures goods known in the market as cushion repair compound, tread repair compound and cover.\r\ncompound.\r\nThese materials, ac cording to the assessee, are used to mend injured and defec tive sections of tyres and are not meant to be used either in the resoling or in retreading of tyres.\r\nUnder the Cen tral Excise & Salt Act, 1944, ( 'the Act '), the above goods were normally dutiable under tariff item No. 15A (2).\r\nHowev er, the assessee claimed exemption from duty under notifica tion No. 71 of 1968 dated 1.4.1968.\r\nBy this notification under section 8 of the Act, the Central Government exempted \"all rubber products, in the form of plates, sheets and strips unhardened, whether vulcanised or not, and whether combined with any textile material or otherwise (other than the products which are made either wholly or partly of rubber and which are used for the resoling or retreading of tyres, including the products commonly known as tread rub ber, camel back, cushion compound, cushion gum, tread gum and tread packing strips) falling under sub item (2) of this item, from the whole of the duty of excise leviable thereon\".\r\nThe Superintendant of Central Excise having re jected the claim for exemption and charged the goods in question to duty at 20% (basic) under the tariff item above mentioned, the assessee preferred an appeal to the Collector of Central Excise, West Bengal.\r\nThe Collector also rejected the claim observing that there was no evidence that the goods in question could not be used for the resoling or retreading of tyres.\r\nThe assessee thereupon preferred a revision to the Central Government under section 36 of the Act as it then stood.\r\nIn the revision petition, it was pointed out that tread repair compound and cushion repair compound were primarily meant for and also used as repair material only with reference to the treads and cushions of tyres and that since they were designed to serve the limited purpose of mending small sections of tyres it would be grossly erroneous to hold that these repair materials could be used in place of tread rubber or camel back which only have the necessary physical dimensions and technical proper ties to serve as retreading and resoling material.\r\nSimilarly cover compound, it was said, was material which was used only for repairing conveyor belting and was also marketed by the assessee solely for the purpose of repairing damaged sections of the conveyor belting.\r\nIt was not meant for use in retreading and resoling of tyres since their sole intend ed use was to repair conveyor belts.\r\nThe Central Government, however, dismissed the revision petition by its order dated 21.5.1974.\r\nThe Government referred to the fact that the 373 notification of exemption specifically excluded cushion compound, cushion gum and tread gum and observed that, in view of this, cushion repair compound and tread repair compound would also be assessable to duty under item No. 16A. So far as cover compound was concerned, it was observed that its composition was such that its use for repair of conveyor belts was indistinguishable from the other use of resoling of tyres.\r\nThe present appeal has been preferred from the order of the Central Government.\r\nOn behalf of the appellant it is pointed out that the whole purpose of the exemption notification was to exclude products which were used for the resoling and retreading of tyres.\r\nThe Government has overlooked that while tread rub ber, cushion compound and tread gum are all items used for resoling or retreading of tyres, that was not the use to which the articles manufactured by the assessee were put.\r\nThe statement of the assessee that the goods manufactured by it were employed only for repairing tyres and conveyor belts has not been disbelieved.\r\nIt is therefore submitted that the Government erred in holding that the goods produced by the assessee are not eligible for the exemption in question.\r\nIn support of his contention, learned counsel for the appellant relied on two important circumstances.\r\nOne is that by a notification No. 27 of 1973 dated 1.3.1973, notifica tion No. 71 of 1968 was amended and the words \"used for resoling, retreading or repairing of tyres\" was substituted for the words \"used for the resoling or retread~ ing of tyres\".\r\nThis amendment was not effective for the period with which we are concerned and it is therefore argued that the compounds used for repairing as against resoling or retread ing will not be covered by the exclusion in the exemption notification.\r\nThe second circumstances relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant is this.\r\nEarlier, there was a notification No. 31 of 1964 under which the duty leviable in respect of latex foam sponge as well as products commonly known as tread rubber or camel back including cushion compound, cushion gum, tread gum, and tread packing strips were subjected to a concessional rate of duty while other rubber products falling under item 16A were granted an exemption from the levy of duty.\r\nIn the context of that notification, a question arose as to whether rubber products which are capable of being used for retreading or resoling of tyres but are only used for repairs would attract duty or not.\r\nThe position was clarified by the Central Board of Excise and Customs in its circular No. Rubber 1\/66 dated 7.2.1966.\r\nThe relevant part of the circular reads as fol lows: 374 \"2.\r\nThose rubber products which are not 'latex foam sponge ' may be excisable under the said tariff item No. 16A but would not attract Central Excise duty unless commonly known as per description given in Column 2 against section No. 2 of the table to the above cited notifi cation.\r\nWhile the scope of the levy on the rubber products thus gets very much restrict ed, it may so happen that different brand names are given by different manufactures to the same or similar product giving rise to the question whether or not a particular product can be deemed to be commonly known as 'tread rubber ', 'camel back ', 'cushion compound ', 'cushion gum ' etc., so as to attract duty.\r\nDoubts of the above nature should not in fact arise in view of para 6 to the 1962 Budget instructions.\r\nIt was made quite explic it therein that 'item is . fairly comprehen sive as to wording but the intention . is to subject only 'latex foam sponge ' and the rubber products popularly known as 'tread rubber ' or camel back ' used for the resoling or retreading of tyres to duty.\r\nThat being the intention a rubber product which is neither 'latex foam sponge ' nor used for the resoling or retreading of tyres is classifiable as 'all other products ' and therefore exempt from whole of the duty leviable thereon under section No. 3 of the Table to the above cited notifi cation.\r\nIt is possible that some of the rubber products are capable of being used for re treading or resoling of tyres.\r\nMere capacity does not, however, attract duty in the absence of normal usage in that manner being estab lished it would not be appropriate to hold that the products are dutiable.\r\nRubber products used for repair of tubes or tyres also, in view of what has been stated above, does not attract duty.\r\nPending cases regarding assessment of rubber products may be finalised accordingly\".\r\nLearned counsel submits that the above interpretation is equally applicable in the context of notification No. 71 of 1968.\r\n375 We are of opinion that the appellant 's contention is well founded.\r\nThe notification of 1978 only reproduces with some modifications the notification of 1964; however, the broad purport of both the notifications is to exempt rubber products other than those which are commonly sold under certain descriptions and are used for the resoling or re treading of tyres.\r\nThe circular of 1966, which can be con sidered as a contemporaneous exposition of the understanding of the Government while issuing the exemption notification of 1964, makes it clear that, at that time, it was not intended to deny exemption to rubber products used merely for repair purposes.\r\nThe notification of 1973 was one in which various amendments were carried out to a series of notifications relating to various items and does not contain anything to suggest that it was only a clarification that was intended to be given and not a prospspective amendment of the previous notification.\r\nAs already mentioned, the fact that the appellant is using or marketing the products for use, only for repairing tyres and conveyor belts is not controverted.\r\nIn these circumstances, we are of opinion that the appellant assessee was entitled to exemption under the notification.\r\nIn one sense, any rubber compound has a compo sition which theoretically permits it to be used either for repair purposes or for resoling or retreading of tyres.\r\nBut the assessee 's contention is that the product marketed by it ' has not the physical dimensions or technical properties to be capable of use for retreading or resoling.\r\nAlso, the notification talks of products \"used for\" resoling and retreading of tyres and that is not the case here.\r\nThe notification thus imports a limitation on the exclusion from the exemption specified in the paranthetical clause of the notification.\r\nThat exclusion is only in respect of compound used for resoling or retreading.\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above we allow this appeal and set aside the order of the Central Government under section 36 of the Central Excise Act as well as the orders of the subordinate authorities and hold that the assessee is enti tled to the exemption prayed for.\r\nThe concerned assessment will be modified accordingly.\r\nWe however make no order as to costs.\r\nG.N. Appeal allowed.",

N. Mukherjee for the Appellants.\r\nMahabir Singh for the Respondents.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATH MISRA, J.\r\nSpecial leave granted.\r\nThe short question which falls for decision in this appeal is whether gratuity payable to a workman employed under the Calcutta Dock Labour Board (hereinafter referred to as 'Board ') is attachable for satisfaction of a decree of the Court.\r\nMd. Safiur Rehman was a dock worker and gratuity was payable to him under one of the three prevailing schemes of the Board.\r\nRespondent l filed a suit before the Court of Small Causes at Calcutta asking for recovery of a sum of money against the widow and son of the said Md. Safiur Rehman after his death and prayed for attachment of the gratuity payable to the said workman.\r\nThe Court made an order and called upon the 828 Board to withhold payment of the amount whereupon the Board pointed out to the Court that gratuity was not liable to attachment On receipt of such intimation, the Court, made an order requiring the Board to show cause as to why it may not be proceeded against for disobedience of the Court 's direction.\r\nThe Chief Judge of the Court of small Causes examined the objection against attachment and overruled the same.\r\nAgainst the rejection of the Objection the appellants moved the High Court at Calcutta and contended that the gratuity payable to the workman was not liable to attachment.\r\nA Division Bench of the High Court examined the tenability of the contention and came to the following conclusion: \"On a careful consideration of the legal position we, however, find that the learned Chief Judge is right in his conclusion.\r\nPlaintiff has a legal right to attach any debt payable to his debtor or legal representative.\r\nThis right, however, is always subject to exceptions made by any statutory provision.\r\nSection 13 of the no doubt bars attachment but that only is in respect of gratuity payable under that Act.\r\nThe gratuity now under attachment is payable not under the Act.\r\nSection 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended may bar attachment of gratuity as now under consideration.\r\nBut that section as it now stands had not been made applicable to Presidency Small Causes Court.\r\nUnder Section 8 of the Code, the High Court adopted certain provisions of the Code including section 60 as amended upto 1965 and made them applicable to Presidency Small Causes Court.\r\nSection 6, clause (g) so adopted reads as follows ' T (g).\r\nStipends and gratuities allowed to pensioners of the Government or payable out of any service, family pension fund notified in Official Gazette by the Central Government or the State Government in this behalf and political pensioners.\r\nThis clause does not cover the gratuity payable by the Board to a registered dock worker and the subsequent amendment of this clause not having been adopted and made applicable by the High Court to Presidency Small Causes Court, the learned Chief Judge is right in his conclusion.\r\n829 T Next reliance is placed on Rule 9 of the Gratuity A Rules which no doubt purports to exempt gratuity from attachment.\r\nBut these rules not having been made by the Central Government on powers delegated by the Parliament under the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment) Act, but by the Board on sub delegation of powers under the scheme.\r\nthe same in our view cannot override the legal right of the plaintiff.\r\n\" Mr. Mukherjee appearing for the appellants maintained that the view taken both by the Chief Judge of the Small Causes Court as also the Division Bench of the High Court is contrary to law and, therefore, cannot be sustained.\r\nThe respondents had filed an appearance through counsel but no one participated in the hearing.\r\nSection I (3) of the (39 of 1972) ( 'Act ' for short), provides that the Act shall extend to ports. 'Port ' has been defined in section 2 (n) of the Act.\r\nThere can be no dispute that the Calcutta Port is covered by the .\r\nIt is true that under one of the three schemes framed by the Calcutta Dock Labour Board gratuity was payable to Md. Safiur Rehman, but such gratuity must be taken to be covered by section 4 of the Act, in the absence of any notification contemplated under section 5.\r\nSection S authorises the appropriate Government by notification and subject to such conditions as may be specified in that notification to exempt, inter alia any port to which the Act applies, from the operation of the provisions of the Act, if in the opinion of the appropriate Government tile employees in the port are in receipt of gratuity or pensionary benefit not less favourable than the benefits conferred under the Act.\r\nNeither the Chief Judge nor the High Court has found that there has been a notification as contemplated under section 5 of the Act in this case.\r\nIt had also not been contended at any stage by the respondents that such a notification had been made.\r\nReference may now be made to sections 13 and 14 of the Act which ale very relevant.\r\nProtection of gratuity : No gratuity payable under this Act shall be liable to attachment in execution of any decree or order of any civil, revenue or criminal court.\r\n\" 830 14.\r\nAct to override other enactments.\r\netc.: The provisions of this Act or any rule made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent there with contained in any having effect by virtue of any enactment other than this Act.\r\n\" We may point out that by Central Act No. 25 of 1984 section 13 has been amended with effect from July 1, 1984, and the amended section reads thus: \"No gratuity payable under this Act and no gratuity payable to an employee employed in any establishment, factory, mine, oilfield, plantation, port, railway company or shop exempted under section 5 shall be liable to attachment in execution of any decree or order of any civil, revenue, or criminal court.\r\n\" In the absence of any notification within the meaning of section 5 of the Act the amendment is not relevant for consideration Section 14 has overriding effect and section 13 gives total immunity to gratuity from attachment.\r\nThe preamble of the Act clearly indicates the legislative intention that the Act sought to provide a scheme for payment of gratuity to all employees engaged in, inter alia, ports and under this Act gratuity was payable to workers like Md Safiur Rehman.\r\nThe gratuity which was payable to him squarely came within the purview of the Act and, therefore, become entitled to immunity under section 13 thereof.\r\nIn section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure provision for exemption from attachment has been made and a detailed list has been provided in sub section\r\n(1) thereof in clauses (a) to (p).\r\nClause (g) there of exempts stipends and gratuities allowed to pensioners of the Government or of a local authority or of any other employer from attachment.\r\nIt may be pointed out that the words \"local authority\" or \"other employer\" were inserted into the statute by the amending Act of 1976 with effect from February 1, 1977.\r\nThe Chief Judge as also the High Court relying on the provisions of section 8 of Code took the view that unless extended by the High Court of Calcutta, the protection of section 60 was not available in regard to proceedings before the Presidency Small Causes Court at Calcutta.\r\nIt appears that the Calcutta High Court in exercise of power under section 8 of 831 the Code had extended the provisions of the section 60 of the Code but the High Court seems to have wrongly taken the view that the effect of section 97 of the Amending Act of 1976 was that the notification of the High Court was no more effective unless re made.\r\nIt is wholly unnecessary for the disposal of this appeal to examine that aspect as in our view the immunity under section 13 of the Act is adequate to accept the appeal and find against the respondent.\r\nWe, therefore.\r\nallow the appeal and hold that the Chief Judge as also the High Court were in error in taking the view that gratuity payable to Md. Safiur Rehman was liable to attachment.\r\nParties are directed to bear their own costs.\r\nsection R. Appeal allowed.",

N. Lekhi, M.K. Garg and V. K. Jain for the Appellants.\r\nA. P. section Chauhan and C.K. Ratnaparkhi for the Respondents.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR, J.\r\nThese appeals by certificate granted by the Allahabad High Court raise the following substantial question of law of general importance which needs to be decided by this Court: \"Whether the view taken by the Full Bench in Smt.\r\nMaya vs Raja Dulaji and others (1) that the lessor\/landlord should not only be disabled person on the relevant dates, but that he should continue to live on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting, within the meaning of clauses (h) of section 21 (1) of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, represents a correct construction of clause (h) of section 21(1) of the Act ?\" The facts giving rise to the aforesaid question may be stated.\r\nOne Smt Ram Kali, widow of Tikam Singh, was the land holder of the plots (agricultural land) in dispute situated in villages Agaota 371 and Khaiya Khera in District Bulandshahr (U.P.).\r\nOn June 14, 1945 Smt.\r\nRam Kali who was a Sirdar and a 'disabled person ' falling within section 157 (1) of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (hereinafter called \"the Act\") executed a registered deed of lease for a period of S years in favour of Uttam Singh (the predecessors in title of the respondents) but before the expiry of the period of S years she died in August, 1945 and Dan Sahai (her husband 's real brother and predecessors in title of the appellants) inherited her interest.\r\nDan Sahai was also a 'disabled person ' within the meaning of section 157(1) of the Act.\r\nIt seems that after the expiry of the period of the registered lease Uttam Singh and Murli Singh continued to hold the land as tenants from year to year under Dan Sahai.\r\nIn consolidation proceedings a question arose whether Uttam Singh and Murli Singh, who were lessees under Smt.\r\nRam Kali and Dan Sahai acquired the status of Sirdars or they remained Asamis of the plots in dispute.\r\nThe case of Dan Sahai was that they were Asamis and not adhivasis entitled to be treated as Sirdars under section 240 of the Act and that depended upon whether as tenants or occupants of the plots in dispute their case fell within the provisions of section 21(1) (h) of the Act.\r\nThe contention of Dan Sahai was that since Smt.\r\nRam Kali was a disabled person on the date of letting and since he who succeeded her was also a disabled person on April 2, 1946, the lease in favour of Uttam Singh and Murli Singh would fall within section 21(1) (h) and as such Uttam Singh and Murli Singh shall be deemed to be Asamis.\r\nOn the other hand the contention on behalf of Uttam Singh and Murli Singh was that the land holder should not only be a disabled person on both the dates mentioned in sub cl.\r\n(a) of cl.\r\n(h) of section 21(1? (being the date of letting as also April 9, 1946) but the same landlord should continue to live on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting (which is 1 7 1952 under the Act) and since in the instant case the same landlord who had let out the plots and who was disabled person on the date of letting had not continued to live on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting section 21(1) (b) was totally inapplicable and, therefore, they were entitled to be treated as Sirdars.\r\nThe Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeals Nos.\r\n424 425 of 1971 accepted the contention raised by counsel on behalf of Uttam Singh and Murli Singh (the respondents ' predecessors) relying on the view taken by the Full Bench in Smt.\r\nMaya vs Raja Dulaji and others (1) and decided the appeals in their favour by holding that they were not Asamis but had become Sirdars.\r\n372 At the outset it may be stated that it was not disputed either in the lower courts or before us that both Smt.\r\nRam Kali as well as Shri Dan Sahai who succeeded to her interest in the plots after her death were disabled persons under section 157((1) of the Act.\r\nIn fact it was accepted by both the sides that on the date of letting (being 14th June, 1945) Smt.\r\nRam Kali, the then land holder was a disabled person and on 9th April, 1946 (being the other relevant date under sub clause (a) of clause (h) of section 21(1) Dan Sahai, the then land holder, was a disabled person who continued to be the land holder upto the date of vesting, and the question is whether in such 8 case the occupation of the plots by Uttam Singh and Murli Singh under the lease from both of them would fall within the provisions of section 21(1) (h) of the Act.\r\nThe relevant provision runs thus: \"21(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, every person who, on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting, occupied or held land as . . (h) a tenant of sir of land referred to in sub clause (a) of clause (i) of the explanation under section 16, a sub tenant referred to in sub clause (ii) of clause (a) of section 20 or an occupant referred to in sub clause (i) of the said section where the land holder or if there are more than one land holders, all of them were person or persons belonging (a) if the land was let out or occupied prior to the ninth day of April, 1946, both on the date of letting or occupation, as the case may be, and on the ninth day of April, 1946, and (b) if the land was let out or occupied on or after the ninth day of April, 1946, on the date of letting or occupation, to any one or more of the classes mentioned in sub section (I) of Section 157.\r\nshall be deemed to be an asami thereof \" 373 In other words, section 21 (1) (h) provides that every person occupying or A holding land in any one of the capacities mentioned in cl.\r\n(h) on the date immediately preceding 1 7 1952 shall be deemed to be an Asami thereof notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, if the landholder or if there are more than one all of them were disabled persons within the meaning of section 157(1), both on the date of letting as well as on April 9, 1946 where the letting has taken place prior to April, 9, 1946, or were disabled persons on the date of letting if the letting has occurred after April 9, 1946.\r\nIn the instant case it is not disputed that Uttam Singh and Murli Singh were on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting holding or occupying the plots in question in one or the other capacity mentioned in cl.\r\n(h); secondly, since the letting was prior to April 9, 1946 sub cl.\r\n(a) of cl.\r\n(h) is attracted and it is also not disputed that on the date of letting the then land holder (Smt.\r\nRam Kali) was a disabled person and on April 9, 1946 the then land holder Dan Sahai, who succeeded her, was also a disabled person under section 157(1) of the Act.\r\nIncidentally Dan Sahai continued to be the land holder on the date immediately preceding 1.7 1952.\r\nOn these facts it seems to us clear that all the requirements of section 21(1) (h) could be said to have been satisfied but the Division Bench relying upon the Full Bench decision in Smt.\r\nMaya vs Raja Dulaji and others (supra) held that Uttam Singh and Murli Singh were not Asamis and had become Sirdars because section 21(1) (h) was not attracted inasmuch as in their view it was a requirement of that provision that not merely should the land holder be a disabled person on both the dates mentioned in sub cl.\r\n(a) of cl.\r\n(h) but the same land holder should continue to be landholder on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting (i.e. the identity of the disabled land holder or landholders on both the dates and the land holder or land holders seeking the benefit or protection of the provision on the date immediately preceding 1.7.1952 must, remain unchanged) and this requirement was not satisfied in this case.\r\nThe question is whether on true construction of the provision such a requirement can be read into the said provision ? In Smt.\r\nMaya vs Raja Dulaji and others (supra) the facts were that the disputed plots belonged to one Bijain and were inherited on his death by his widow Smt.\r\nLakshmi and when Smt.\r\nLakshmi died her minor unmarried daughter Kumari Maya became the land holder.\r\nHer elder sister Saheb Kunwar acting as her guardian executed a registered lease of the plots in favour of the plaintiffs (Ram Charan and others) on 15.10.1947 for a period of five years (a case falling under sub cl.\r\n(b) of cl.\r\nLater on Maya was also married to her 374 sister 's husband Thakurdas who was admitted to the holding as co tenant with Maya, with the consent of the Zamindar in the year 1948.\r\nThus on the date of vesting (1.7.1952) both Maya (who was still minor and disabled person) as well as her husband Thakurdas were the land holders of the plots in question.\r\nThe lessee plaintiffs filed a suit in the year 1954 for a declaration that they had become Adhivasis of the land on the coming into force of the U.P.Z.A. and L.R. Act and had subsequently acquired Sirdari rights on the passing of the U.P. Act XX of 1954 The suit was decreed by both the Courts below and hence Maya defendant preferred a second appeal to the High Court.\r\nThe question raised for determination was whether for the purposes of section 21 ( 1) (h) the disability of the landholders who were in existence on the date of vesting was material or the disability of the land holders who let out the land was a deciding factor? The Court noticed that section 21(1) (h) had been introduced in the Act for the first time by U.P. Act XVI of 1953 with retrospective effect from July 1, 1952 and was later on amended by U.P. Act XX of 1954 and has thereafter continued in its present form.\r\nSection 21(1) (h), as originally enacted, in express terms required that \"the land holder or if there are more than one landholder all of them were person or persons belonging, both on the date of letting and on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting, to any one or more of the classes mentioned in sub section\r\n(2) of section 10 or cl.\r\n(viii) of sub section\r\n(I) of section 157\".\r\nAs a result of the amendment made by Act XX of 1954 the words \"both on the date of letting and on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting\" were omitted.\r\nIn other words, by the amendment the requirement that disability of the land holder should subsist on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting was deleted.\r\nThe Full Bench accepted the position that for purposes of section 21(1) (h), in its present form, the disability of the land holder need not continue or subsist on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting and might cease on or before the date of vesting but took the view that in the case before it there were two land holders on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting, namely, Smt.\r\nMaya and her husband Thakurdas, that a new body of 'land holders ' had come into existence subsequent to the date of letting and that all of them were not land holders who had let out the land as disabled person and, therefore, the plaintiffs became Adhivasis and the defendants were not entitled to the benefit of section 21(1) (h) of the Act.\r\nIn other words, the Full Bench has been of the view that for purposes of section 21(1) (h) it is necessary that the land holders on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting must be the same persons as those who let out the 375 land and suffered from disability on the date of letting, and also on A April 9, 1946 in case the letting was before that date.\r\nIn other words, the identity of the land holder or land holders must remain unchanged up to the date of vesting.\r\nFor reading such a requirement into the provision the Full Bench has given two reasons: (a) that such a requirement arises on construction of certain words used in cl.\r\n(h) (vide: para 17 of the Judgment) and (b) that the protection given to a disabled landholder was intended to be a personal protection granted to the very individual who let out the land as a disabled person and this was warranted by a historical survey of parallel provisions contained in the preceding Tenancy Laws in U.P. (vide: Para 19).\r\nAccording to the Full Bench the crucial words used in cl.\r\n(h) are \"where the landholder or if there are more than one land holder all of them were person or persons belonging\" to any one or more of the classes of disabled persons under section 157(1) and the Full Bench has reasoned \"the word 'are ' and the word 'them ' together with the word 'were ' in the aforementioned phrase clearly show that the intention of the Legislature was that on the date of vesting the 'land holder ' should be the very person who was the land holder on the relevant dates, to earn the benefit of cl.\r\n(h) of section 21(1)\".\r\nThe Court observed that section 21(1) (b) could bear the interpretation suggested by counsel for Smt.\r\nMaya only if the words 'or their predecessor in interest ' were added before the words \"all of them\".\r\nThe Court has further stated that historical survey of the parallel provisions contained in the preceding Tenancy Laws showed that the protection given to a disabled person had always been in the nature of a personal protection granted to the very individual who let out the land as a disabled land holder and the protection ceased to be available when the identity or personality of that land holder is changed and in that behalf reliance was placed on certain provisions of the Agra Tenancy Act, 1926 and U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939.\r\nIn our view neither reason holds good for sustaining the literal construction placed upon the provision by the Full Bench.\r\nIt is true that cl.\r\n(h) contains the phrase \"where the land holder or if there are more than one landholder, all of them were persons belonging\" to any one or more of the classes mentioned in section 157(1), but for arriving at the correct interpretation of this crucial phrase it is necessary to have regard to the definition of 'landholder ' and the provisions of section 157 of the Act with which section 21(1) (h) is inter connected.\r\n376 Under section 3(26) of the Act, the definition of 'landholder ' as given in the U.P. Tenancy Act 1939 has been adopted since the expression is not defined in the Act.\r\nThat expression has been defined in section 3(11) of the U.P. Tenancy Act 1939 thus: \"Landholder\" means the person to whom rent is or, but for a contract express or implied would be, payable.\r\n\" This definition must be read in light of section 3(1) of that Act which runs thus: \"All words and expressions used to denote the possessor of any right, title or interest in land, whether the same be proprietary or otherwise, shall be deemed to include the predecessors and successors in right, title or interest of such Person.\" In other words, the expression 'landholder ' who obviously is a possessor of interest in land under section 3(11) means a person to whom rent is payable, and under section 3(1) by legal fiction it shall include his predecessor in interest as also successor in interest to whom the rent was or is payable.\r\nIt is such definition that will have to be read in the U.P.Z.A. and L.R. Act wherever that expression occurs.\r\nIt is thus obvious that the expression 'landholder ' occurring in section 21(1) (h) must mean a person to whom rent is payable and by fiction would include his predecessor in interest.\r\nRead in this light there would be no question of adding the word predecessor in interest of the land holder in section 21(1) (h) as that would be implicit in the term 'landholder ' on account of the deeming provision of section 3(1) read with section 3(11) of the Tenancy Act, 1939.\r\nIt does appear that this aspect of the matter was not brought to the notice of the Full Bench when it construed the concerned crucial phrase.\r\nMoreover after the amendment effected by Act XX of 1954 the thrust of cl.\r\n(h) is on the landholder or landholders being disabled persons on the material dates only.\r\nFurther section 157(1) permits leases by disabled persons and says that a Bhumidhar or an Asami holding land in lieu of maintenance allowance under section 11, who is a disabled person falling under any of the clauses (a) to (g), may let the whole or any part of his holding; and the proviso thereto is very important which runs thus: \"Provided that in the case of a holding held jointly by more persons than one, but one or more of them but not 377 all are subject to the disabilities mentioned in clause (a) to (g), the person or persons may let out his or their share in the holding.\" And sub section\r\n(2) provides that where any share of a holding has been let out under the aforesaid proviso the Court may on an application of the Asami or the tenure holder determine the share of the lessor in the holding and partition the same.\r\nHaving regard to the aforesaid proviso under which even in the case of a joint holding a lease of his share by a disabled land holder is permissible and the same is liable to be separated by a partition it is obvious that the expression \"all of them\" must refer to all such land holders who were disabled land holders on the material dates.\r\nWhen under the proviso to s 157(1) a lease of his share by a disabled land holder in joint holding (held alongwith a non disabled person) is expressly permitted and under section 157(2) the Court has to determine such share of the disabled lessor and partition the same on an application being made in that behalf, it is difficult to accept that the Legislature intended to deprive the protection of section 21(1) (h) to such disabled land holder simply because on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting such land holder comes to hold the land jointly with some other non disabled land holder.\r\nIn other words on the facts found in the Full Bench case when on the date of letting the entire holding belonged to Smt.\r\nMaya who was a disabled person and on the date of vesting she alongwith her husband Thakurdas (a non disabled person) became joint holder, could Smt.\r\nMaya at any rate to the extent of her share in the joint holding be denied the benefit of section 21(1) (h) notwithstanding the proviso to section 157(1) and section 157(2) being in the Statute ? The answer is obviously in the negative.\r\nIn fact in view of the fact that on the material date (being the date of letting) the entire holding belonged to Smt Maya the disabled person, and having regard to the deeming provision which has to be read in the definition of 'landholder ' and having regard to the thrust of amended cl.\r\n(h) which does not require that the successor in interest be a disabled person on the date of vesting, the benefit of section 21 (1) (h) should have been extended or made available in respect of the entire holding.\r\nIn other words, on true construction of the crucial phrase occurring in cl.\r\n(h) it is not possible to read into the provision the additional requirement, namely, that the identity of the land holder or land holders must remain unchanged up to the date of vesting.\r\n378 Coming to the second reason the Full Bench has observed that a historical survey of parallel provisions of the Agra Tenancy Act 1926 and U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939 supported the conclusion that protection was granted only to the very individual who let out the land as a disabled land holder and the protection ceased when the identity of the personality of that land holder changed and in that behalf reference was made to section 29(6) and (7) of the former Act and section 41 (2) of the latter Act.\r\nNow apart from the fact that the scheme of the U.P.Z.A. and L.R. Act is different from these two earlier enactments, a careful analysis of the two provisions in the earlier enactments will clearly show that in each of the provisions express words had been used conferring personal rights on the individuals concerned which is not the case with section 21(1) (h) of the Act.\r\nHaving regard to the above discussion we are of the opinion that the view taken by the Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in Smt.\r\nMaya vs Raja Dulaji and others (supra) does not represent the correct construction of section 21(1) (h) of the Act.\r\nOn true construction of the said provision in our view, the benefit thereof would be available to the land holder on the date of vesting, if the same landholder or his predecessor existing on the material dates was a person or persons belonging to one or more of the classes mentioned in section 157(1) of the Act.\r\nSince in the instant case, which falls under sub cl.\r\n(a) of cl.\r\n(h), on the date of actual letting Smt.\r\nRam Kali was disabled person and since on the next material date, namely, April, 9 1946 Dan Sahai (successor in interest of Smt.\r\nRam Kali) was also a disabled person, the land holder on the date of vesting, who incidentally happened to be Dan Sahai, would be entitled to the benefit of section 21(1) (h) and the respondents (successors of Uttam Singh and Murli Singh) would remain Asamis and cannot be said to have become Sirdars.\r\nWe might mention that after the arguments in these appeals were concluded and our Judgment was ready for pronouncement we were informed that in a later case Dwarika Singh vs Dy.\r\nDirector of Consolidation (l) a larger Bench of S Judges of the Allahabad High Court has, by majority, overruled the view taken in Smt.\r\nMaya 's case.\r\n379 In the result the appeals are allowed, the orders of the Division Bench in Special Appeals Nos.\r\n424 425 of 1971 are set aside and for reasons given by us above, the decision of the learned Single Judge dated May 10, 1971 is restored.\r\nWe direct that each party will bear its own costs.\r\nsection R.

Gokhale, B.P. Maheshwari and N.M. Shetye, for the appellant (in C.A. No. 660 of 1966) and respondent No. 1 (in C.A. No. 811 of 1966).\r\nD.L. Sen Gupta, Janardan Sharma and S.K. Nandy, for the appellants in (C.A. No. 811 of 1966) and respondent No. 1 (in C.A. No. 660 of 1966).\r\nA. S.R. Chari and D.N. Mukherjee, for respondent No. 2 (in both the appeals).\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by Vaidialingam, J.\r\nIn these two appeals, by special leave, the company and the workmen 's Union attack the award of the Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal, dated January 14, 1965, in so far as it is against each of them.\r\nThe Government of West Bengal, by its order dated November 5, 1963, referred for adjudication six issues, viz.: \"1. Revision of dearness allowance.\r\nRevision of the scheme of gratuity.\r\nAge of superannuation.\r\nLeave and holidays.\r\nCanteen facilities; and 6.\r\nShift allowance for supervisors.\r\nIn both these appeals we are concerned only with issues nos.\r\n1 to 3.\r\nWith regard to dearness allowance, the Tribunal had directed that it should stand revised from November 1963.\r\nIt provided a sliding scale for an increase or decrease of Re. 1\/ for rise or fall of five points in the cost of living index, with retrospective operation from November 1963.\r\nIt further directed that the dearness allowance payable for each month from November 1963 shall be recalculated on that basis and additional amounts due to workmen should be paid in two monthly instalments after the date of publication of the award.\r\nThere was a further direction to the effect that the dearness allowance for any particular month shall be calculated on the basis of average cost of living index for three immediately preceding months.\r\nRegarding gratuity, the Tribunal effected certain modifications to the then existing scheme of gratuity, under rules 1, 2 and 3.\r\nThe Tribunal increased the maximum gratuity payable to 15 months 116 salary, but deleted the provision contained in the scheme that the maximum should not exceed Rs. 4,000\/ .\r\nIn rule 2, it further directed the deletion of the qualifying period of 10 years continuous and approved service.\r\nIt also modified the provisions of r. 3 by providing for payment of gratuity less any financial loss that has been caused to the employer as a result of misconduct which necessitated the termination of service.\r\nIt further provided that in case of a workman leaving service without notice or terminating his employment without the permission of the company, in order to enable him to get gratuity he should have put in service of ten completed years or more.\r\nThe Tribunal increased the existing age of superannuation from 55 years to 58 years.\r\nThe Union, in its appeal C.A. No. 811 of 1966, attacks the award in respect of all the above matters; but so, far as the company 's appeal C.A. No. 660 of 1966 is concerned, though it has challenged the award, again, in respect of all the above matters to the extent to which they are against it, this Court has granted special leave, by its order dated April 28, 1965, only on the question of dearness allowance.\r\nBefore we proceed to deal with the contentions of the parties regarding the award in question, we can straight away dispose of two applications filed by the company.\r\nC.M.P. No. 329 of 1967 has been filed by the company for leave to.\r\nurge additional grounds in the appeal.\r\nBy this application the appellant seeks permission to raise contentions regarding certain modifications effected by the Tribunal in the gratuity scheme.\r\nThat is, substantially, the company attempts to reopen the limited leave given by this Court on April 28, 1965.\r\nThe company has also filed C.M.P. 2860 of 1968 referring therein to certain subsequent proceedings and requesting this Court to take them into consideration in considering the question of dearness allowance.\r\nBoth these applications are opposed by the Union and we see no reason to grant the requests contained in each of them.\r\nThese two applications are accordingly dismissed.\r\nWe shall first take up the question of dearness allowance.\r\nWhile, on the one hand, the appellant wants a substantial reduction in the dearness allowance granted by the Tribunal, the Union, in its appeal, seeks a substantial increase in the dearness allowance granted by the award.\r\nWe have already indicated the decision of the Tribunal in this regard.\r\nBefore we actually deal with the contentions of Mr. Gokhale, learned counsel for the company, and Mr. Chari and Mr. Sen Gupta, who followed him, for the Union, it is necessary to refer to certain previous awards, as well as agreements, with reference 117 to dearness allowance.\r\nThough there have been certain awards prior to 1954, it is enough if we state the history, beginning from the agreement between the company and the Union, entered into on September 15, 1954.\r\nUnder clause 11 of this agreement it was provided that the then existing rate of dearness allowance would prevail, unless there was a substantial change in the working class cost of living index, in which case the rate would be suitably adjusted.\r\nThere is no controversy that the rate of dearness allowance, which was continued under this agreement, was Rs. 30\/ .per month.\r\nThe issue relating to dearness allowance was referred, by the State of West Bengal, to Shri G. Palit, the Fifth Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal.\r\nIt is necessary to refer in some detail to the award of Shri Palit, dated August 26, 1957, because the Industrial Tribunal, in the present case, has not chosen to go behind the said award.\r\nShri Palit found that after the agreement of September 15, 1954, there had been a substantial increase in the cost of living index justifying the grant of an increased dearness allowance, as contemplated under cl. 11 of the agreement.\r\nAccording to him, in August 1954 the working class cost of living index stood at 344.1 and in August 1955 it came down to 338.4; it again went up to 391.4 in August 1956.\r\nShri Palit has also stated that in May 1957 the cost of living index reached 400.6 points.\r\nAccordingly he has noted that there has been a rise of 56 points, from 344.1 in August 1954 to 400.6 in May 1957 and that the said increase justifies a revision of the original rate of dearness allowance.\r\nIn considering the quantum of increase in dearness allowance that should be awarded, Shri Palit has again taken note of the fact that at 344 points in September 1954, at the time when the agreement was entered into, the dearness allowance was Rs. 30 per month, and that there is no dearness allowance up to 180 points of the cost of living index.\r\nAccording to him, the dearness allowance of Rs. 30 per month, in September 1954, represented the dearness allowance for the points in excess of 180 points, viz., for 164 points and that this roughly worked out at Re. 1\/ dearness allowance for every 51\/2 points.\r\nOn this basis Shri Palit held that to cover 56 points ' rise (400 minus 344), the dearness allowance, which could be legitimately claimed by the Union, would be Rs. 10\/ odd, as it in fact appears to have been claimed.\r\nBut, as normally only 75% neutralisation is granted and in view of the fact that the company, which was a chemical industry, was also in a tight corner, he held that full neutralisation should not be granted.\r\nOn this reasoning Shri Palit allowed Rs. 7\/ as increase in dearness allowance on the pay scale up to Rs. 50\/ and increased dearness allowance of Rs. 5\/ , thereafter, for the next Rs. 50\/in the pay scale.\r\nIn view of the fact that the company had 118 already allowed an increase of dearness allowance of Rs. 2\/ , Shri Palit directed that the increase of dearness allowance, as ordered by him, should be adjusted against the amount already paid by the company.\r\nBoth the company and the Union appealed to this Court against this award of Shri Palit.\r\nThe decision of this Court is reported as Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works Ltd., Calcutta vs Their Workmen(1).\r\nReferring to the agreement dated September 15, 1954, this Court.\r\nobserved that the rate of dearness allowance., continued under that agreement, was accepted by the parties as reasonable on the date of the agreement till there was a substantial change in the working class cost of living index.\r\nThis Court further stated that the findings given by Shri Palit were on facts and no permissible ground had been shown for interference with it in an appeal by special leave.\r\nThe award of Shri Palit was confirmed by this Court and the company 's appeal was dismissed with costs.\r\nThe Union did not press its appeal and that too.\r\nwas dismissed with costs.\r\nOn January 6, 1962 there was again a memorandum of settlement between the company and the Union, and under cl. 6 it was provided that the then existing slab of dearness allowance in relation to.\r\nthe basic pay of the employees would be increased by Rs. 3\/ and that the increase was to have effect from November 1, 1961.\r\nThe Union made a demand, on May 21, 1962, for revision of the dearness allowance, scheme of gratuity and the age of superannuation.\r\nIt also.\r\npresented its demands, on September 3, 1962, to the Assistant Labour Commissioner, West Bengal.\r\nWith reference to the revision of dearness allowance, the.\r\ndemand of the Union was that there should be hundred percent neutralisation.\r\nAs conciliation failed, a reference was made, by the State Government, on November 5, 1963.\r\nWe have already indicated the nature of the directions given in the award, in respect of dearness allowance.\r\nThe Tribunal, in the award in question, has, after elaborately referring to the agreement of September 15, 1954 as well as the award of Shri Palit and the settlement dated January 6, 1962, rejected the contention of the company that no, case had been made out for a revision of the dearness allowance.\r\nIn this connection the: Tribunal referred to.\r\nthe chart, filed by the Union, regarding the cost of living index during the years 1961 to 1964 and has noted that the correctness of the chart had not been disputed by the company.\r\nIt is of opinion that in January 1962, when the settlement was arrived at on January 6, 1962, the index number was 402 and, after referring to the index numbers in the various months between 1962 and 1964, it concluded that there (1) [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 136. 119 had been a substantial increase in the cost of living index and hence a revision of the dearness allowance was necessary.\r\nThe Tribunal no doubt took the view that the financial ability of the company to bear the additional burden, did not come in for consideration because by cl. 10 of the settlement dated January 6, 1962, the company had agreed to.\r\na modification of the dearness allowance if there was a substantial change in the working class cost of living index.\r\nRegarding the rate of variation that had to.\r\nbe fixed, the company appears to have pressed for the acceptance of the principle laid down by this.\r\nCourt in The Hindustan Times Ltd., New Delhi vs Their Workmen(1) providing for the linking of the dearness allowance with the cost of living index.\r\nIt also appears to have urged that the provision made in the said decision regarding dearness allowance that it should be increased or decreased by Re. 1\/ for a rise or fall in the cost of living index by 10 points should be adopted; that is, the appellant pressed that the variation should be linked to a variation of 10 points.\r\nOn the other hand, the Union appears to.\r\nhave pressed for the acceptance of the method adopted by this Court in a case from West Bengal in Workmen of Hindusthan Motors vs Hindusthan Motors(\") viz. o.f providing a sliding scale of an increase or decrease of Re. 1\/ for a rise or fall of every five points in the cost of living index.\r\nThe Tribunal has, after holding that it cannot go behind the award of Shri PaIit as the said award had been confirmed by this Court, accepted the Union 's contention that there should be an increase or decrease of dearness allowance by Re. 1\/ for an increase or decrease of every 5 points in the cost of living index.\r\nIt has also held that the cost of living index at the time when the agreement of January 6, 1962 was entered into was 402 and the dearness allowance of Rs. 3\/ fixed under the said settlement could be referred only to the said figure of 402.\r\nThe Tribunal then considered the question as to from what date the revision of dearness allowance should be given effect to.\r\nThough the company contended that the award should become operative only from the date when it was given and the Union, on the.\r\nother hand, contended that it should be given effect to from the date when the demand for revision was made by it, the Tribunal ultimately held that the increased dearness allowance granted by it should take effect from the month when the reference was made by Government, viz., November 1963.\r\nMr. Gokhale, learned counsel for the company, has urged that the linking of dearness allowance at the rate provided in the [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234.\r\n(2) [1962] II L.L.J. 352.\r\n120 award is not justified as it departs from the past practice evidenced by the various awards, as well as the agreements and settlements, entered into by the parties.\r\nThe Tribunal, counsel urges, has given no special reason to depart from the method adopted on previous occasions According to the learned counsel, the dearness allowance, if any, should have been given on an adhoc or lump sum basis as had been done on prior occasions.\r\nMr. Gokhale also urges that the financial position, or capacity to bear the additional burden, that will be cast on the company by the grant of increased dearness allowance, which has been held by decisions of this Court to be a relevant factor to.\r\nbe taken into account, has not been considered at all by the Tribunal.\r\nIn the alternative, counsel urges that even assuming that the method of linking, adopted by the Tribunal, was correct, a very serious mistake has been committed by the Tribunal when it has proceeded on the basis that the increase should be granted on the basis that there has been a rise over the cost of living index of 402.\r\nAccording to Mr. Gokhale, the evidence clearly shows that on the date of the settlement, viz. January 6, 1962, the cost of living index for January 1962 could not have been available and the parties had before them only the cost of living index for the month of November 1961, which was 421 points and it is on that basis that an increase of Rs. 3\/ was fixed in the settlement of January 6, 1962.\r\nTherefore any dearness allowance that is granted must have reference to a rise of the cost of living index above 421 points.\r\nCounsel also attacks the direction regarding effect being given to the award from November 1963.\r\nWhile contesting the appeal of the company, Mr. Chaff, and Mr. Sen Gupta, learned counsel for the Unions concerned, have urged that at no stage has the dearness allowance been fixed, in this ,company, on any scientific basis.\r\nAccording to the learned counsel, the agreement, entered into between the parties, should not be taken as indicative of the fact that complete neutralisation has been effected in the matter of fixing dearness allowance.\r\nAccording to them, Shri Palit has committed a fundamental error in assuming that in the 1954 agreement full neutralisation has been given.\r\nCounsel also point out that the extent or degree of neutralisation to be granted is not rigid and that though hundred per cent neutralisation is not normally given, nevertheless in the case of the lowest paid employees such neutralisation is permissible.\r\nCounsel also urged that the Tribunal has committed a mistake in not accepting the claim of the Union that the question of dearness allowance will have to be considered entirely on the materials placed before it.\r\nwithout in any manner being influenced by the award of Shri Palit.\r\nIt is also, pointed out that even the appellant wanted a sliding scale to be attached to the dearness allowance and provision made for the rate of dear 121 ness allowance being liable to be increased or decreased by Re. 1\/ for a rise or fall in the cost of living index by every 10 points, as will be seen from the fact that it pressed for the acceptance of the 'principle laid down by this Court in the Hindustan Times Case(1).\r\nIt is further urged that the Tribunal was justified in granting dearness allowance for an increase over the cost of living index of 402, as that was the price .index in the month of January 1962 when the settlement between the parties was effected.\r\nIn the appeal, by the Union, regarding dearness allowance, Mr. Sen Gupta, learned counsel, urges that there should have been cent per cent neutralisation in the award of dearness allowance and that there should have been a complete de novo examination of the claim made by the Union for revision of dearness allowance, without being influenced by the award of Shri Palit.\r\nIn this connection counsel refers to the decision of this Court in Remington Rand of India vs Its Workmen(2) where it has been held that when a rise.\r\nin the cost of living index has been established, the claim for a revision of dearness allowance cannot be rejected without examining its merits solely on the ground that because a provision has been made for adjustment from time to time, by agreement of parties in a scheme, that scheme ought to remain in force for all time and cannot be reopened or re examined.\r\nCounsel further urges that in any event, the Tribunal should have given effect to its award from May 1962, when the Union had made the.\r\ndemand for revision of dearness allowance.\r\nBefore we deal with the contentions of the learned counsel, it will be desirable to refer to a few decisions of this Court laying down the principles that have to be borne in mind when a claim for dearness allowance or revision of dearness allowance is considered.\r\nIn Clerks of Calcutta Tramways vs Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd.(3) it is observed: \" 'We can now take it as settled that in matters of the grant of dearness allowance except to the very lowest class of manual labourers whose income is just sufficient to keep body and soul together, it is impolitic and unwise to neutralise the entire rise in the cost of living by dearness allowance.\r\nMore so in the case of the middle classes.\r\n\" (1) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234.\r\n(2) [1962] 1 L.L.J. 287.\r\n(3) ; , 779.\r\nC.I.\/69 9 122 In the Hindustan Times Case(1) it is stated at p. 247: \"As was pointed out in Workmen of Hindusthan Motors vs Hindusthan Motors (2), the whole purpose of dearness allowance being to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living, it should ordinarily be on a sliding scale and provide for an increase on rise in the cost of living and a decrease on a fall in the cost of living.\" In Greaves Cotton & Co. vs Their Workmen(a), after referring to the Hindusthan Motors Case(2) and French Motor Car Co. 's Case(4), this Court laid down that the basis of fixation of wages and dearness allowance is industry cum region and observed, at p. 368: \"The principle therefore which emerges from these two decisions is that in applying the industry cum region formula for fixing wage scales the Tribunal should lay stress on the industry part of the formula if there are a large number of concerns in the same region carrying on the same industry; in such a case in order that production cost may not be unequal and there may be equal competition, wages should generally be fixed on the basis of the comparable industries, namely, industries of the same kind.\r\nBut where the number of industries of the same kind in a particular region iS small it is the region part of the industry cum region formula which assumes importance particularly in the case of clerical and subordinate staff, for, as pointed out in the French Motor Car Co 's Case(4), there is not much difference in the work of this class of employees in different industries. ' ' Again, at p. 374, it is stated: \"Time has now come when employees getting same wages should get the same dearness allowance irrespective of whether they are working as clerks, or members of subordinate staff or factory workmen.\r\n\" In Ahmedabad Mill owners Association vs The Textile Labour Association(5) it has been emphasised that in trying to recognize and give effect to the demand for a fair wage, including the payment of dearness allowance to provide for adequate neutralisation, industrial adjudication must always take into account the problem of the additional burden which such wage structure would impose upon the employer and ask itself whether the employer can reasonably be called upon to bear such burden.\r\n(1) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234.\r\n(2) [1962] II L.L.J. 352.\r\n(3) ; (4) [1963] Supp.\r\n(5) [1966] I S.C.R. 382.\r\n123 In Kamani Metals & Alloys Ltd. vs 'Their Workmen(1) it has been noted that one hundred per cent neutralisation is not advisable as it will lead to inflation and therefore dearness allowance is often a little less than one hundred per cent neutralisation.\r\nThe following principles broadly emerge from the above decisions: 1.\r\nFull neutralisation .is not normally given, except to the very lowest class of employees.\r\nThe purpose of dearness allowance being to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living, it should ordinarily be on a sliding scale and provide for an increase on the rise in the cost of living and a decrease on a fall in the cost of living.\r\nThe basis of fixation of wages and dearness allowance is industry cum region. ' 4.\r\nEmployees getting the same wages should get the same dearness allowance, irrespective of whether they are working as clerks or members of subordinate staff or factory workman.\r\nThe additional financial burden which a revision of the wage structure or dearness allowance would impose upon an employer, and his ability to bear such burden, are very material and relevant factors to be taken into account.\r\nHaving due regard to the above principles, we are satisfied, in the instant case, that the Tribunal has made substantially a correct approach in considering the claim for revision of dearness allowance.\r\nWe are not impressed with the contention of either the company or the Union that the Tribunal has committed an error in the matter of revising the dearness allowance.\r\nThe company appears to have been more intent upon pressing that there has been no substantial increase in the cost of living since the settlement, dated January 6, 1962 and that, m any event, the Union, n view of cl. 10 of the settlement, was not entitled to ask for a division of dearness allowance before the expiry of three years.\r\nThe Tribunal has referred to the rise in the cost of living index after the date of the settlement of January 6, 1962, and it has also, in our opinion, quite rightly held that cl.\r\n10 of the settlement is no bar for entertaining the claim; therefore, its decision hat a revision of the dearness allowance should be made iS perfectly correct.\r\n(1) ; 124 The Tribunal is also.\r\njustified in rejecting the contention of the Union that the revision of the dearness allowance must be made de novo, ignoring the previous award of Shri Palit.\r\nThough, normally, when a claim for revision of dearness allowance is made and a rise in the cost of living index has been established, such a claim has to be considered on its merits, as held by this Court in the Remington Rand Case(1), it cannot be lost sight of, in this case, that the decision of Shri Palit was affirmed by this Court and the appeals, filed by the company and the Union, were dismissed on the ground that the agreement of 1954 was reasonable ,and the findings of Shri Palit were all on facts.\r\nIn view of this, the Tribunal, in our view, was perfectly justified in proceeding on the basis that the award of Shri Palit should form the basis for considering the nature of the revision of dearness allowance that would be permissible.\r\nWe have already referred to the various matters, adverted to by Shri Palit in his award.\r\nIf really the case of the Union was, as is now sought to be put before us, that the dearness allowance on prior occasions had not been fixed on any scientific basis and that Shri Palit erred in proceeding on such an assumption with reference to previous agreements, the proper stage when these questions should have been canvassed was in the Union 's appeal, before this Court, against the award of Shri Palit.\r\nHaving allowed that appeal to be dismissed as not pressed, it is no longer open to the Union to raise those contentions now.\r\nWe are therefore satisfied that the Tribunal 's view that Shri Palit 's award should form the basis for further reconsideration of the claim for revision of dearness allowance is correct.\r\nThe Tribunal has no doubt stated that the financial ability of the company does not come in for consideration, as the company agreed, by the settlement of January 6, 1962, to pay increased dearness allowance if there was a substantial change in the cost of living index.\r\nIt is true that the additional financial burden that will be thrown on the company by reason of the revision of dearness allowance is a very material and relevant factor to be taken into account in such circumstances; but, in this case, we do.\r\nnot find in the written statement, filed by the company, am plea taken that if the claim of the Union, as made in its charte of demands in respect of dearness allowance is accepted, it will cast a very.\r\nheavy financial burden on the resources.\r\nof the corn pany.\r\nIn the absence of any such plea having been taken, w consider it unnecessary to pursue this contention of the appellan any further.\r\nThere is the additional circumstance of the provision for modification, as contained in the settlement of January 1962 (1) [1962] II.L.J. 287.\r\n125 The appellant, so far as we can see, has not placed any material before the Tribunal regarding the comparable industries in the region.\r\nAs pointed out by the Union, the company seems to have pressed for the grant of dearness allowance being liable to be increased or decreased by Re. 1\/ , as was done by this.\r\nCourt in the Hindusthan Times Case ( 1 ).\r\nThe Union appears to have pressed for an increase or decrease of Re. 1\/ in dearness allowance with a rise or fall of every 5 points in the cost of living index.\r\nIt is therefore obvious that the appellant also wanted linking of Re. 1\/ for every 10 points.\r\nIt must also be borne in mind that the alternative way, propounded by the Union, for grant of dearness 'allowance has been rejected by the Tribunal.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it cannot be stated that the Tribunal has committed any error in accepting the claim of the Union, supported as it was by the decision of this Court in the Hindusthan Motors Case(2).\r\nMr. Gokhale next urged that the view of the Tribunal that the increase of Rs. 3\/ as.\r\ndearness allowance, given in the settlement dated January 6, 1962, must have been on the basis that the index number was 402, was erroneous.\r\nThe settlement was made on January 6, 1962, on which date the index number for January 1962 could not have been available to the parties.\r\nThe last month for which the index number was available was for the month of November 1961 and it was 421.\r\nThe index number at the time when the award was given by Shri Palit was about 400 and it was really for an increase of 21 points that Rs. 3\/ as increment was provided in the settlement.\r\nThough when the Tribunal gave the present award the index number for January 1962 was already available, that figure could not have formed the basis of the settlement, and it is inconceivable that for a rise of only 2 points, i.e., from 400 in 1957 to 402 in 1962, a rise of Rs. 3\/ in the dearness allowance would have been provided for.\r\nTherefore the increase or decrease provided for by the Tribunal must really relate to the cost of living index of 421 points, and not to 402 points.\r\nMr. Sen Gupta, learned counsel for the Union, found considerable difficulty in supporting that reasoning in the award on this matter.\r\nWe are in agreement with the contentions of Mr. Gokhale in this regard.\r\nChart, Exhibit 4, furnished by the Union, clearly shows that the index number in November 1961 was 421 points.\r\nIt also shows that the index for January 1962 was 402 points, but the index for that month was not available till the end of January 1962 and it could not have been before the parties when the settlement was made on January 6, 1962.\r\nTherefore, the index number of 421 must have been taken into (1) [1964] I S.C.R. 234.\r\n(2) [1962] II I.L.J. 352.\r\n126 account on the date of the settlement and it must have been really for the increase of 21 points, after the date of Shri Palit 'section award, that the additional sum of Rs. 3\/ was fixed as dearness allowance.\r\nIf on the other hand, the Tribunal 's view is correct, there would have been only an 'increase of 2 points, from 400 to 402, and for that increase of 2 points, the sum, of Rs. 3\/ was fixed, as dearness allowance.\r\nIn our opinion, that reasoning of the Tribunal cannot be accepted.\r\nTherefore the award of the Tribunal will have to be modified, in this regard, by directing that the sliding scale providing for an increase or decrease of Re. l\/for a rise or fall of every 5 points, must be related to the cost of living index of the base of 421 (that being the cost of living index for November 1961 ) and not of the base of 402, as.\r\ndirected by the Tribunal.\r\nThe last contention of Mr. Gokhale, bearing upon dearness allowance, is that the direction that the award will have retrospective effect from November 1963 is erroneous.\r\nIn this connection: Mr. Gokhale referred us to el.\r\n10 of the settlement of January 6, 1962 stating that the settlement was to remain operative for three years.\r\nAccording to learned counsel, any rise in dearness allowance should have effect only after the expiry of three years from January 6, 1962, or, at any rate, from the expiry of three years from November 1, 1961, the date on which the increase in the settlement had been given effect to.\r\nMr. Sen Gupta, in the Unions appeal, pressed for the award being given effect to from May 1962 when the Union had made a demand on the company for revision of dearness allowance, especially when the Tribunal had itself found that there had been a substantial rise in the price index after the date of the settlemeat.\r\nIt will be seen that both the parties have a grievance regarding the date from which the revision of dearness allowance should be given effect to, We are not impressed with the contentions of both the parties, in this regard.\r\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the rise in the cost of living index, as well as the demand having been made by the workmen, as early as May 21,.\r\nIt has also adverted to the fact that the reference, by the State Government, was made on November 5, 1963.\r\nIt has further adverted to.\r\nthe fact that though ' the cost of living index had increased considerably, the company did not choose to adjust the dearness allowance suitably.\r\nIt was, after having regard to all the circumstances that the Tribunal felt that the workmen should get dearness allowance commensurate with the cost of living index, at least from the month of reference, viz., November 1963.\r\nAs laid down by this Court in the Hindusthan Times Case(1), no general formula can be laid down as to the date from which a (1) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234. 127 Tribunal should make its award effective and that that question has to be decided by the Tribunal On a consideration of the circumstances of each case.\r\nIn the said decision this Court declined to interfere with the Tribunal 's direction that reliefs given by it would become effective from the date of reference.\r\nIn Kamani Metals Ltd. Case(1) the workmen had made demands on July 1, 1961.\r\nThe Conciliation Board was moved on September 8, 1962 and, when conciliation failed, a reference was made on December 14, 1962.\r\nThe Tribunal made an award, retrospective from October 1, 1962, a date between the reference to conciliation and the reference to the Tribunal.\r\nThat decision of the Tribunal was accepted by this Court.\r\nRecently, in Hydro (Engineers) Pvt. Ltd. vs The Workmen(2) this Court declined to interfere with the direction given by a Tribunal that its award should take effect from the date of demand made by the workmen.\r\nIt has also been pointed out, in the said decision, that it is a matter of discretion for the Tribunal to decide, from the circumstances of each case, from which date its award should come into operation, and no general rule can be laid down as to the date from ' which a Tribunal should bring its award into force.\r\nTherefore it will be seen that when a Tribunal gives a direction regarding the date from which it has to become effective, no question of principle, as such, is involved.\r\nFrom the above decisions of this Court, it will also be seen that this Court has declined to interfere with an award having effect from either the date of demand, or the date.\r\nof reference, or even a date earlier than the date of reference but after the date of demand.\r\nIn fact, the direction given by the Tribunal, in the case before us, giving effect to its award from the date of reference, squarely comes within the decision of this Court in the Hindusthan Times Case(3) and, as such, that direction is correct.\r\nTo conclude, on this aspect of dearness allowance, excepting for the direction that the rate of increase or decrease awarded by the Tribunal should be related to the cost of living index of 421 and not 402 (as directed by the Tribunal), in all other respects the decision of the Tribunal on this point will stand.\r\nThis closes ' the discussion on the appeal of the company and the appeal of the Union, in so far as they relate to dearness allowance.\r\nThere are two further points, taken by the Union, in its appeal, one relating to the modifications effected to the gratuity scheme, and the other relating to the age of superannuation.\r\nThe provisions in the gratuity scheme, which came up for consideration before the Tribunal, were as follows: (1) ; (2) [1969] 1 S C.R. 156.\r\n(3) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234. 128 \"1.\r\nOn the death of an employee while in the service of the company, one month 's salary for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of 12 months salary not exceeding Rs. 4,000 on the average of the last three years salary to be paid to his heirs or dependants as the Board may in their discretion decide.\r\nOn voluntary retirement due to illness or termination of service by the company after 10 years continuous and approved service one month 's pay for each year of service subject to a maximum of 12 months pay not exceeding Rs. 4,000.\r\nNo employee shall be entitled to claim any gratuity if he is dismissed for dishonesty or misconduct or if he will have left service without notice or terminated his employment without the permission of the Company.\r\n\" The Tribunal has effected certain modifications.\r\nto r. 3 which, in our opinion, are quite consistent with the decision of this Court in Management of Wenger & Co. vs Workmen(1).\r\nTherefore the Union cannot have any grievance regarding the Tribunal 's directions, in this 'regard.\r\nSo far as rr. 1 and 2 are concerned, the Tribunal modified them by increasing the ceiling from 12 months ' salary to 15 months ' salary and deleted the pecuniary limit of Rs. 4,000.\r\nIn r. 2, the Tribunal further directed the deletion of 10 years ' continuous and approved service, to enable a workman to get gratuity in the circumstances mentioned therein.\r\nMr. Sen Gupta, learned counsel for the Union, urged that the Tribunal committed an error in prescribing the ceiling of 15 months ' basic wages and that the Tribunal should have modified r. 1 by providing that the average last one year 's salary should be taken into account for the purpose of calculating gratuity, instead of the three years ' period provided in the rule.\r\nMr. Gokhale, learned counsel for the company, pointed out that his client has been prejudiced by the modifications effected by the Tribunal, but the company had now been precluded from raising these objections because of the limited leave given by this Court.\r\nNevertheless, the counsel pointed out, inasmuch as the Tribunal was increasing the ceiling from 12 months to.\r\n15 months and deleting the further pecuniary limit of Rs. 4,000\/ , as well as the qualifying period to enable a worker to earn gratuity, the Tribunal must have felt that no further modifications were necessary.\r\nIn our opinion no case has been made out by the Union for interfering with the directions given by the Tribunal and we are also satisfied that there has been no improper exercise of discretion by the Tribunal in this regard.\r\nIt has effected certain modifications in favour of the (1) [1953] supp.\r\n2 S.C.R. 862.\r\n129 workmen and obviously it did not think it necessary to make any further .modifications as pressed by the Union.\r\nTherefore, the objections to the: modifications, raised on behalf of the Union have to be rejected.\r\nThe last point that has been agitated by the Union, in its appeal, is regarding the age of.\r\nsuperannuation.\r\nThe provision regarding age of superannuation, as obtaining then in the company, was as follows : \"The age of retirement as mentioned in the Company 's Standing Orders under r. 9 will henceforth be strictly followed in case of all employees.\r\nThe employees.\r\nhenceforth shall retire at the age of 55.\r\nExtension, if any, will depend on Company 's discretion.\r\n\" The Tribunal increased the age of superannuation to 58 years from 55 years.\r\nIt has relied upon two circumstances in coming to this conclusion: (a) that this Court has raised the age of retirement from 55 to 58 years in Jessop 's Case(1) which was a case from West Bengal, with regard to clerical and subordinate staff, other than those who.\r\nwere workers under the Factories Act.\r\nThe appellant 's industry, which is of a different nature, being a chemical and pharmaceutical industry, all the workmen of such a company factory workers or non factory workers should have the same age of superannuation.\r\n(b) The fixation of the age of retirement for its employees, by the Government of West Bengal, at 58 years.\r\nMr. Sen Gupta urged that the age of superannuation should have been raised to 60 years.\r\nIt is not necessary to refer to the earlier decisions of this Court, on this point.\r\nRecently, in The Management of Messrs. Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Co. Ltd. vs Its Workmen(2), this Court, after a review of the prior decisions, held that in fixing the age of superannuation the most important factor that has to be taken into consideration is the trend in a particular area.\r\nApplying this test, we are satisfied that the Tribunal 's fixing of the age of retirement at 58 years is justified.\r\nAs already noted, it has relied upon Jessop 's Case(1) which related to West Bengal and the age of retirement fixed by the State Government.\r\nTherefore the Tribunal has taken note of the trend in the particular area, viz., West Bengal, when it increased the age of superannuation from 55 to 58 years.\r\nTherefore the Union 's claim that it should be further increased to 60 years cannot be sustained.\r\n(1) [1964] I L.L.J. 451.\r\n(2) Civil Appeal No. 44 of 1968, decided on May 1, 1968.\r\n130 In the result, excepting for the modification indicated by us with regard to the cost of living index in respect of dearness allowance, in all other respects we confirm the award.\r\nThe appeal, by the company, is therefore partly allowed to the extent of the modification noted above.\r\nThe appeal of the Union is dismissed.\r\nParties will bear their own costs.\r\nG.C. C.A. No. 660\/66 partly allowed.\r\nNo. 811 \/ 66 dismissed.",

B. Pai, J. B. Dadachanji, O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for respondents Nos. 1, 3 and 7.\r\nA.V. Viswanatha Sastri and Sardar Baliadur, for respondent No. 2.\r\n522 1963.\r\nMay 2.\r\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO J.\r\nThis is an appeal on a certificate granted by the Bombay High Court and arises out of a suit filed by the appellant as a Hindu reversioner to recover possession of properties alienated by a Hindu widow.\r\nThe property in suit was the self acquired property of one Ganpatrao jairam who died in 1894 leaving behind two widows, Annapurnabai and Sarswatibai.\r\nGanpatrao had executed a will by which property in village Dahisar was given to Annapurnabai and property in village Nagaon was given to Sarswatibai.\r\nThe will further provided that a dwelling house together with structures and open land situate at Thana would remain with his two wives who would enjoy the same.\r\nThere were other dispositions in the will with which we are however not concerned now.\r\nAnnapurnabai was also authorised to make an adoption on the advice of the executors appointed under the will; but the adopted son was to have no right or connection with the movable and immovable property devised to Annapurnabai during her life time and was to take the property devised to her only after her death.\r\nThe adopted son was also to take the immovable property bequeathed to Saraswatibai after her death.\r\nIt may be added that no son was adopted by Annapurnabai and this aspect of the matter therefore need not be considered further.\r\nAnnapurnabai died on September 17, 1915, and she had executed a will before her death.\r\nAfter Annapurnabai 's death, Saraswatibai began to manage the property.\r\nIt may be added that Sarswatibai had adopted a son, but this was saidto beagainst the provision in the will of herhusband which specifically directed that she could only adopt if Annapumabai died without making an adoption from amongst the family on the advice of the executors.\r\nThere was therefore 523 litigation in connection with the adoption between Saraswatibai and Balkrishna Waman, one of the legatees under the will of Ganpatrao, which ended in favour of Balkrishna Waman.\r\nSaraswatibai died in 1943.\r\nThe case of the appellant was that the will of Ganpatrao merely gave widow 's estate to Annapurnabai and Saraswatibai.\r\nConsequently Annapurnabai could not dispose of the property given to her by will and the bequests made by her were not binding on the appellant as the next reversioner.\r\nIt was also alleged that the will made by Annapurnabai was vitiated by the exercise of undue influence brought to bear on her by Balkrishna Waman, who was the husband of her niece.\r\nSaraswatibai also made certain alienations and the appellant contended that the sale by Saraswatibai was due to the undue influence exercised on her by Balkrishna Waman, and in any case there was no legal necessity for transfer and therefore the transfer was not binding on the appellant.\r\nThe main defendant in the suit was Ganesh, a son of Balkrishna Waman.\r\nIn addition there were twelve other defendants who were alienees in possession of the property and were joined in the suit as the appellant prayed for recovery of possession from them also.\r\nThe suit was resisted by the main defendant Ganesh for two main reasons.\r\nIt was first contended that the appellant was an undischarged insolvent at the time succession opened in 1943 and therefore whatever property might come to him as a reversioner vested in the official receiver.\r\nTherefore, the appellant had no right to bring a suit to recover possession even after his absolute discharge because the property never vested in him.\r\nSecondly, it was contended that by his will Ganpatrao had granted an absolute estate to the two widows and therefore 524 Annapurnabai had full right to make a will with respect to the property given to her and Sarswatibai had the right to make alienations if she thought fit.\r\nBesides these two main defences, it was also contended that the appellant was not the nearest reversioner and the alienations made by Sarswatibai were for legal necessity.\r\nThe same defence was raised by the other defendants.\r\nIn addition the alienees from Sarswatibai contended that they were bona fide pur chasers for value without notice of the defect in their vendor 's title and therefore the alienations made in their favour could not be set aside.\r\nThey further pleaded that they had made substantial improvements on the properties purchased by them.\r\nOn these pleadings as many as eighteen issues were framed by the trial court.\r\nTwo of these issues covered the two main defences which were raised, namely, (1) Is the plaintiff entitled to maintain the suit due to his insolvency as alleged by the defendants? (3) Had Annapurnabai no authority to will away the properties in her possession? The trial court held that the plaintiff was entitled to maintain the suit.\r\nThe third issue obviously raised the question whether the bequest to Annapurnabai was that of widow 's estate or an absolute bequest, and the trial court held in that connection that the bequest to Annapurnabai was that of widow 's estate and therefore she had no right to will away the properties in her possession.\r\nThe trial court also gave findings on the remaining issues and finally declared that the alienations made by Saraswatibai on March 29, 1930 and April 16, 1935 were not for legal necesssity and therefore were not binding on the appellant and the defendants of the suit were directed to deliver 525 possession of the suit properties to the appellant.\r\nInquiry as to mesne profits was also directed and Rd finally the trial court ordered that notice be given to the receiver in the insolvency application No. 48 of 1939 to consider if he wanted the property to be made available for distribution amongst creditors in the aforementioned application.\r\nThe defendants then went in appeal to the High Court and two separate appeals were filed one by original defendant No. 3 and the other by original defendant No. I and some others.\r\nThe two appeals were heard together by the High Court and the two principal questions which arose, according to the High Court, were as to (i) the effect of the dispositions made by Ganpatrao under his will, and (ii) the right of the plaintiff to maintain the suit when he was, at the date when the succession opened, an undischarged insolvent, These two questions, it will be seen, correspond to the two issues raised by the trial court, which we have set out above.\r\nThe High Court first considered the right of the plaintiff to maintain the suit and held that the plaintiff had no right to maintain the suit, as he was an undischarged insolvent at the time the succession opened and he could not maintain the suit even after his absolute discharge.\r\nThe High Court further held that the disposition in favour of Annapurnabai of the property in Dahisar amounted to conferment of absolute estate on her and further that the disposition in favour of Saraswatibai of the property in Nagaon amounted to conferment of absolute estate on her.\r\nOn these findings the High Court dismissed the suit.\r\nThereupon the appellant applied for a. certificate which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\r\n526 The first question that falls for consideration is whether the appellant can maintain the suit.\r\nIt is necessary in that connection to see what the facts are with respect to the insolvency of the appellant.\r\nThe appellant had filed an insolvency application in 1939 and was adjudged insolvent on March 11, 1940 and two years time was granted to him to apply for discharge.\r\nThe appellant applied for discharge on July 6, 1942 and he was granted an absolute discharge in January, 1944.\r\nThe succession to the estate of Ganpatrao had however opened on May 4, 1943 when the appellant was still an undischarged insolvent.\r\nConsequently, the case of the defendants respondents was that under section 28 (4) of the Provincial Insolvency Act, No. 5 of 1920, (hereinafter referred to as the Act), the property which devolved on the insolvent after the date of the order of adjudication and before his discharge forthwith vested in the court or receiver.\r\nIt is further urged that the property having vested in the court or receiver it must remain so vested even after the absolute discharge of the appellant for the order of absolute discharge merely absolved the insolvent from liability from payment of debts other than those mentioned in section 44 of the Act.\r\nTherefore when the suit was brought in 1947 after the discharge the appellant had no title in the property as the title still vested in the court or receiver, and consequently the appellant could not maintain the suit for ejectment against those in possession of the property as he had no title on which he could base his right to sue for ejectment.\r\nThe question therefore that arises for determination is whether an insolvent on whom property devolves when he is an undischarged insolvent can maintain a suit for the recovery of the property after his absolute discharge.\r\nThe decision of that depends on what effect the order of absolute discharge has on the insolvent 's title to the property 527 which develoved on him when he was still an undischarged insolvent.\r\nIt is to this narrow question, (namely, whether a suit brought by an insolvent after his absolute discharge with respect to property which devolved on him when he was an undischarged insolvent can be maintained by him), that we address ourselves hereafter.\r\nIn view of this narrow question it is in our opinion unnecessary to consider those cases on some of which the High Court has relied which deal with the, right of the insolvent to maintain a suit while he is still an insolvent.\r\nWhat we say hereafter will only apply to a case where the suit is brought by an insolvent after his absolute discharge, though the right to property which is in suit devolved on him when he was an undischarged insolvent.\r\nIt will be necessary in this connection to consider briefly the scheme of the Act, to decide exactly what the consequences are when an absolute discharge is granted to an insolvent.\r\nSection 6 of the Act defines what are acts of insolvency.\r\nSection 7 gives power to a debtor or a creditor to make an application for insolvency, if the debtor has committed an act of insolvency.\r\nSection 9 deals with applications made by creditors and section 10 by debtors.\r\nSection 19 provides for the procedure for hearing an insolvency petition.\r\nSections 20 and 21 provide for interim proceedings against the debtor and appointment of an interim receiver.\r\nSection 25 provides for dismissal of the petition on grounds mentioned therein Section 27 gives power to the court to make an order of adjudication and the Court also has to fix a time therein within which the debtor shall apply for his discharge.\r\nSection 28 with which we are mainly concerned lays down the effect of an order of adjudication.\r\nSub section (2) thereof provides that on the making of an order of adjudication, the whole of the property 528 of the insolvent shall vest in the court or in a receiver and shall become divisible among the creditors Under sub section\r\n(7) this vesting will relate back to and take effect from the date of the presentation of the petition on which the order of adjudication is made.\r\nSub section (4) which is also material lays down that \"all property which is acquired by or devolves on the insolvent after the date of an order of adjudication and before his discharge shall forthwith vest in the court or receiver, and the provisions of sub section\r\n(2) shall apply in respect thereof.\" This sub section undoubtedly vests in) the court or receiver any property which the insolvent acquires after the order of adjudication and before his discharge or which devolves on him in any manner, and such vesting takes place forthwith Section 33 provides for the making of a schedule of creditors after the order of adjudication and section 34 lays down what debts are provable under the Act.\r\nSection 56 provides for the appointment of a receiver and section 59 lays down the duties and powers of the receiver Scction 61 provides for priority of debts and section 62 for calculation of dividends.\r\nSection 64 lays down that when the receiver has realised all the property of the insolvent or so much thereof as can, in the opinion of the court, be realised without needlessly protracting the receivership, he shall declare a final dividend.\r\nBut before doing so, the receiver has to give notice to persons whose claims as creditors have been notified but not proved, that if they do not prove their claims within the time limited by the notice, he will proceed to make a final dividend without regard to their claims.\r\nAfter the expiration of such time, the property of the insolvent shall be divided amongst the creditors entered in the schedule without regard to the claims of any other persons.\r\nThen comes section 67 which lays down that \" 'the insol vent shall be entitled to any surplus remaining after payment in full of his creditors with interest as 529 provided by this Act, and of the expenses of the proceedings taken thereunder.\r\n\" It is clear from this scheme of the Act that the entire property of the insolvent belonging to him on the date the petition for insolvency is made vests in the receiver under section 28 (2).\r\nFurther under section 28 (4) if any property is acquired by the insolvent or devolves on him after the order of adjudication and before he is discharged, that property also vests in the court or receiver forthwith.\r\nThe receiver has to administer the property so vested in him and he has the power to sell the property and do various other acts provided in section 59 for the purpose of the administration of the property.\r\nGenerally speaking the receiver sells the property which vests in him and then distributes the money amongst the creditors who have proved their debts.\r\nBut before the receiver declares the final dividend he has to give one more opportunity under section 64 to creditors who might not have proved their debts at the earlier stage, to come and prove their debts.\r\nThis will generally happen when all the property of the insolvent has been disposed of by the receiver, though section 64 contemplates that the final dividend may be declared even if some property has not been disposed of when in the opinion of the court it will needlessly protract the receivership.\r\nSection 67 then finally provides that if any surplus is left in the hands of the receiver after payment in full to the creditors with interest and of the expenses of the proceedings under the Act, the surplus is to be paid to the insolvent.\r\nAs we have said already, the final dividend is generally declared after all the property of the insolvent is disposed of but there may be cases when a final dividend may be declared without the disposition of all the property of the insolvent if in the opinion of the court that would result in needlessly protracting the receivership.\r\nBut it is clear that under section 67 if there is 530 any surplus remaining in the hands of the receiver that surplus has to go to the insolvent.\r\nThough this is the general scheme of the Act with reference to administration of property which vests in the receiver after an order of adjudication, there are two exceptions which may be noticed.\r\nSection 35 provides that where, in the opinion of the court, a debtor ought not to have been adjudged insolvent, or where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the debts of the insolvent have been paid in full, the court shall, on the application of the debtor, or of any other person interested, by order in writing, annul the adjudication.\r\nSection 37 then provides that \"where an adjudication is annulled, all sales and dispositions of property and payments duly made, and all acts therefore done, by the court or receiver, shall be valid ; but, subject as aforesaid, the property of the debtor who was adjudged insolvent shall vest in such person as the court may appoint, or, in default 'of such appoint ment, shall revert to the debtor to the extent of his right or interest therein on such conditions (if any) as the court may, by order in writing, declare.\r\n\" Special stress has been laid on behalf of the respondents on the provision in section 37 which specifically lays down that the property of the debtor in case of annulment shall vest in such person as the court may appoint or in default of such appointment shall revert to the debtor, thus divesting the court or the receiver of the property which had vested in them under section 28 (2) or section 28 (4).\r\nThe second exception is to be found in section 38 which allows compositions and schemes of arrangement.\r\nSection 39 then provides that if the court approves the composition or the scheme of arrangement, the terms shall be embodied in the order of the court and the order of adjudication shall be annulled and the provisions of section 37 shall apply to such annulment.\r\n531 Lastly, we come to what happens where the estate of the insolvent has been administered in the usual way which we have set out already.\r\nSection 41 authorises the debtor to apply for an order of discharge.\r\nOn such an application the court has to consider the objection, if any, made by any creditor and also the report of the receiver in case a receiver has been appointed and thereafter the court may (a) grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge ; or (b) suspend the operation of the order for a specified time ; or (c) grant an order of discharge subject.to any conditions with respect to any earnings or income which may afterwards become due to the insolvent, or with respect to his after acquired property.\r\nSection 42 then lays down in what circumstances the court, shall refuse to grant an absolute order of discharge ; and we may refer to only cl.\r\n(a) of section 42 (1) in that connection which gives power to the court to refuse to grant an absolute order of discharge if it finds that the insolvent 's assets are not of a value equal to eight annas in the rupee on the amount of his unsecured liabilities, unless the in solvent satisfies the court that the fact that the assets are not of a value equal to eight annas in the rupee on the amount of his unsecured liabilities has arisen from circumstances for which he cannot justly be held responsible.\r\nSection 43 provides that if the debtor does not apply for discharge within the period fixed by the court, or does not appear on the day fixed for hearing his application for discharge, the court may annul the order of adjudication or make such other order as it may think fit, and if the adjudication is so annulled, the provisions 532 of section 37 shall apply.\r\nSection 44 then provides for the effect of the order of discharge.\r\nSub section (1) thereof mentions the debts from which the insolvent will not be released on an order of discharge.\r\nSubsection (2) then provides that \"save as otherwise provided by sub section (I.), an order of discharge shall release the insolvent from all debts provable under this Act.\r\n\" Stress is laid on behalf of the respondents on this provision and it is urged that though sub section\r\n(2) provides that the insolvent shall be released from all debts provable under the Act, it does not provide for revesting any property in the insolvent on an order of discharge.\r\nIt is thus clear from the above analysis of the provisions of the Act that if there is no annulment of the adjudication and no sanction of a composition or scheme of arrangement resulting in an order of annulment, insolvency proceedings terminate generally after the administration of the properties is complete and a discharge is granted.\r\nThe discharge may be absolute in which case the consequences mentioned in section 44 (2) apply.\r\nOn the other hand discharge may be conditional in which case also the consequences of section 44 (2) apply subject to the conditions attached to the discharge in accordance with sub section\r\n41 (2) (c).\r\nFurther in considering whether an absolute order of discharge should be granted or not.\r\nthe court has to consider whether the in solvent 's assets are of a value equal to eight annas in the rupee on the amount of his unsecured liabilities.\r\nFurther before granting a discharge the court has to consider the report of the receiver if one is appointed.\r\nIt is therefore reasonable to think that generally speaking an order of discharge will only be made after the court has considered the report of the receiver and has also considered that the assets of the insolvent ; are of a value equal to eight annas in the rupee on the amount of his unsecured liabilities.\r\nIt is also not unreasonable 533 to think in view of all the provisions that no order of discharge will generally be made till all the assets of the insolvent are realised, (see section 64), though, as we have already pointed out, it is possible to declare a final dividend even though all the property of the insolvent has not been realised if in the opinion of the court such realisation would needlessly protract the receivership.\r\nIn such a case however the court would generally pass an order protecting the interests of the creditors with respect to the property which has not been realised before the order of discharge.\r\nFinally there is section 67, which provides that if there is any surplus remaining after payment in full of his creditors with interest and of the expenses of the proceedings taken under the Act, it shall go to the insolvent.\r\nThe key to the solution of the narrow question posed before us is in our opinion to be found in section 67.\r\nIt is true that section 44 when it provides for the consequences of an order of discharge does not lay down that any property of the insolvent remaining undisposed of will revest in him and to that extent it is in contrast to section 37, which provides for the effect of an order of annulment and in effect lays down that all sales and dispositions of property made by the receiver shall be valid, but if any property remains undisposed of it shall vest in such person as the court may appoint or in default of any appointment shall revert to the debtor insolvent.\r\nThe reason why section 44 has not provided specifically for the reversion of undisposed property to the insolvent obviously is that the scheme of the Act does not contemplate where there is no annulment that any property which vested in the receiver would remain undisposed of.\r\nIt as section 74 shows the final dividend is generally declared when he receiver has realised all the property of the insolvent there would be no property left unadministered usually when an order of discharge comes to be passed.\r\nIt is however urged on behalf of the respondents 534 that there is nothing in sections 41 and 42 to suggest that a discharge can only be granted after a final dividend is declared and therefore there may be cases where administration by the receiver may still go on after discharge has been ordered.\r\nThis argument, in our opinion, is not quite correct, for cl.\r\n(a) to section 42 (1) definitely requires the court to consider whether the assets are of a value equal to eight annas in the rupee on the amount of his unsecured liabilities, and this the Court generally speaking can only find out after all the property has been realised and final dividend has been declared.\r\nBut, as we have pointed out, it is possible to declare a final dividend and thereafter to get an order of discharge even though some property may not have been disposed of where in the opinion of the court the realisation of such property would needlessly protract the receivership.\r\nTherefore it may be possible in some cases that all the property of the insolvent may not be disposed of before an order of discharge is made.\r\nBut in such a case the court will generally pass orders with respect to the property not disposed of when granting ' an order of discharge.\r\nIt is true that the Act does not contemplate that an insolvent might get an order of discharge and yet retain part of his property free from the liability to pay debts provable under the Act, in case all the debts have not been paid off But it is here that we have to look to the effect of section 67 of the Act.\r\nThat section lays down that the insolvent shall be entitled to any surplus remaining after payment in full of his creditors with interest as provided ' by the Act and of the expenses of the proceedings taken thereunder.\r\nNow, often this surplus would be in the form of money.\r\nBut take a case where an insolvent has come into property by devolution after he became insolvent and before his discharge; and suppose that the property which was devolved on him is worth a few lacs while his debts are only a few thousands.\r\nIn such a case the receiver would not proceed to sell all the property; he would only sell so much of the 535 property as would satisfy the debts in full and meet the expenses of the proceedings in insolvency; the rest of the property whether movable or immovable would not be converted into money.\r\nIt seems to us that it would not be wrong in such a case to call such property whether movable or immovable which remains after payment in full to the creditors with interest and of the expenses of the proceedings in insolvency as \"surplus\".\r\nTo this surplus the insolvent is entitled.\r\nIn such a case therefore it would be proper to hold that if any property remains undisposed of in the shape of surplus that vests back in the insolvent, just as surplus in the shape of money would.\r\nIt is true that cases may arise where what devolves on the insolvent after the order of adjudication and before his discharge may not be easily realisable or may be a matter of dispute which may lead to litigation lasting for many years.\r\nIn such a case the receiver would be entitled to declare a final dividend if the court is of opinion that the property which has de ' volved on the insolvent is subject of protracted litigation and it cannot be realised without needlessly protracting the receivership.\r\nSuch property would also in our opinion be surplus to which the insolvent would be entitled under section 67 subject to his complying in full with the provisions of that section i.e. paying his creditors in full with interest and meeting the expenses of the proceedings taken under the Act.\r\nA third class of cases may arise where the court may not come to know of the property which devolves on the insolvent and grants a discharge in ignorance of such devolution, may be because the insolvent did not bring it to the notice of the court.\r\nIn such a case also in principle we see no difficulty in holding that the property which vested in the receiver under section 28 (4) and which remained undisposed of by him before the discharge of the insolvent would still be surplus to which the insolvent would be entitled, though he may not be permitted to make full use of 536 it until he complies with the conditions in section 67, namely, until payment in full is made to his creditors and the expenses of the proceedings in insolvency are met by him out of the property so remaining undisposed of.\r\nThough therefore there is no specific provision in terms in section 44 (2) with respect to property that may remain undisposed of by the receiver or by the court like the provision in section 37 on an order of annulment, it seems to us that section 67 by necessary implication provides the answer to a case like the present.\r\nAll the property which remains undisposed of at the time of discharge must be treated as surplus to which the insolvent is entitled.\r\nThe insolvent will thus get title to all such property and the vesting in the receiver whether under section 28 (2) or section 28(4) would come to an end on an order of discharge subject always to the insolvent complying in full with the conditions of section 67 in case they have not been complied with before his discharge, for he is entitled only to the surplus after the creditors have been paid in full and the expenses of all proceedings in insol vency have been met Any other view of the effect of discharge would result in this startling position that though the insolvent is freed from his debts under section 44 (2) and is a freeman for all purposes the property which was his and which vested in the receiver under section 28 (4) will never come back to him and will always remain vested either in the court or the receiver.\r\nWe have no doubt that the Act did not contemplate such a situation.\r\nWe have already indicated the reason why section 44 does not provide for revesting of property in the insolvent in contrast to the provision therefor in section 37.\r\nGenerally speaking it is not expected that there would be any property left to revest in the insolvent after the administration in insolvency is over.\r\nWe have therefore to look to section 67 which provides that the insolvent is entitled to any surplus remaining after payment in full of his creditors and after meeting the expenses of the proceedings taken under the Act; and it is that 537 section which gives title to the insolvent in the property which remains undisposed of for any reason before his discharge subject to the conditions of that section being fulfilled even after the discharge.\r\njust as the Act does not contemplate that an insolvent would get an order of discharge and yet retain part of his property without meeting the debts provable under the Act in full, it is to our mind equally clear that the Act does not contemplate that after an insolvent has been discharged his undisposed of property, if any, should for ever remain in the possession of the court or receiver, even though in a particular case the creditors may have been paid in full out of the property disposed of ' and all the expenses of the proceedings under the Act have been met.\r\nIn such a case it seems to us that it is section 67 which must come to the aid of the insolvent and the property which remains undisposed of must be treated as surplus and he gets title to it.\r\nWhere however the insolvent has been discharged without fully meeting the conditions of section 67, he would in our opinion be still entitled to the surplus, even if it be in the shape of undisposed property, subject to his fulfilling the conditions of section 67.\r\nIt may be added that there is nothing in the Act which takes away the right of the insolvent to sue in courts after he has been granted a discharge, for he then becomes a free man.\r\nIn such a situation we are of opinion that he would certainly be entitled to sue in court for recovery of his undisposed of property, if it is in the possession of a third party, after his discharge and such property cannot for ever remain vested in the court or receiver.\r\nAll that justice requires is that in case the conditions of section 67 have not been fulfilled such property should be subject to those conditions, namely, that he should be liable to discharge his creditors in full.\r\nwith interest and to meet the expenses of all proceedings taken under the Act.\r\nSubject to these conditions the insolvent in our opinion would be entitled to undisposed of property on discharge and would be 538 free to deal with it as any other person and, if necessary, to file a suit to recover it.\r\nIt remains now to consider some of the cases which were cited at the bar.\r\nWe have already pointed out that it is unnecessary to consider those cases which deal with the right of the insolvent to file a suit while he is still undischarged, though even on this point there seems to be difference of opinion in various High Courts as to the power of the insolvent; nor is it necessary to refer to the rule in Cohen vs Mitchel (1), which has found statutory expression in section 47 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, (4 & 5 Geo.5, ch. 59).\r\nSection 47 of the English Bank ruptcy Act deals with transactions by a bankrupt with any person dealing with him bona fide and for value, in respect of property, whether real or personal, acquired by the bankrupt after the adjudication, and provides that all such transactions shall be valid if completed before intervention by the trustee (i. e. the receiver).\r\nIn England, therefore intervention by the trustee (i.e. the receiver) is required before completion of the transaction and if the trustee does not intervene the transactions arc generally speaking good.\r\nThat position of law however does not apply in India because of section 28 (4), which specifically lays down that all the property which is acquired by or devolves on an insolvent after the date of an order of adjudication and before his discharge shall forthwith vest in the court or receivers Learned counsel for the parties have not been able to cite any case which deals exactly with a case like the one before us.\r\nWe may however refer to certain observations of learned judges which may be helpful to show how the position has been understood by some High Courts with respect to surplus and also with respect to what happens to undisposed of property after a (1) , 539 discharge, though there is no discussion on the subject in the cases cited.\r\nIn Sayad Daud Sayad Mohd. vs Mulna Mohd. Sayad (1), the Bombay High Court was dealing with a case where an insolvent had filed a suit to recover property four days after he had been adjudicated insolvent '.\r\nLater the official assignee wanted to join as a new plaintiff when he came to know of the suit; but by that time it appears that limitation had expired, and the question arose whether the suit would be said to have been filed afresh on the date the official assignee intervened.\r\nIt was held that that was so, for the insolvent could not maintain a suit after he had been adjudicated insolvent and so far as the official assignee was concerned the suit must be held to have been filed on the date he asked for intervention and would therefore be barred by time.\r\nIt will be seen that the case deals with a suit brought by an undischarged insolvent and not with a suit as in the present case brought by a discharged insolvent.\r\nBut the learned judges observed that the vesting order for the time being was paramount, even though an insolvent might eventually be entitled to what might remain as surplus after satisfying his creditors, thus showing that what remains as surplus becomes the property of the insolvent.\r\nYellavajjhula Surayya vs Tummalapalli Mangayya (2) is a case more directly in point.\r\nIn that case the plaintiff was declared an insolvent in 1919.\r\nHe was still an insolvent in 1929 when certain property devolved on him as reversioner.\r\nHe was granted an absolute discharge in August 1931.\r\nNo creditors had come to prove their debts or to take steps between 1919 and 1929; nor did the official receiver take any step prior to 1929 or between 1929 to 1931.\r\nAfter his absolute discharge, the plaintiff instituted a suit for recovering the property.\r\n, In that (1) (2) A.I.R. (1941) Mad.\r\n345 540 suit, Varadachariar J. observed and, if we may say so with respect, rightly that the construction of cl.\r\n(4) of section 28 was not free from difficulty; but went on to add that there was nothing in the policy of the Insolvency Law to suggest that it was intended to benefit strangers, and in the circumstances the plain ' tiff could maintain the suit, though the learned judge added that nothing that was said in the judge ment would prejudice the right, if any, of the official receiver or of the creditors of the plaintiff to assert such rights and remedies as they might have in law in respect of the suit properties.\r\nIt will be seen that this case was almost similar to the case before us and the court held that in such circumstances the discharged insolvent could maintain the suit, though the reasoning was only in one sentence, namely, that there was nothing in the policy of the Insolvency Law to suggest that it was intended to benefit strangers.\r\nIn Rup Narain Singh vs Har Gopal Tewari an insolvent acquired some property after the order of adjudication.\r\nIt was apparently not brought to the notice of the receiver and was mortgaged by the insolvent while he was still undischarged.\r\nLater after his discharge the mortgagee brought a suit to enforce the mortgage.\r\nThe insolvent mortgagor had transferred part of the property to other persons who were also made parties.\r\nThese persons raised the defence that as the mortgagor was an undischarged insolvent when he executed the mortgage, it was void.\r\nThe High Court negatived this contention and relying on section 43 of the Transfer of property Act decreed the suit.\r\nIn the course of the judgment the High Court however observed that after the order of discharge was passed, the property had been divested from the receiver and revested in the insol vent, though no reason was given for this view.\r\nIn Dewan Chand vs Manak Chand (2) the facts were that a certain property devolved on an insolvent, (1) I.L.R. (1933) 55 All.\r\n(2) A.I.R. (1934) Lab.\r\n809 541 who made a mortgage of it, apparently without bringing it to the notice of the receiver.\r\nAfter the insolvent was discharged, a suit was brought to enforce the mortgage and a question arose whether section 43 of the Transfer of property Act would apply.\r\nIn that connection the High Court observed that after the insolvent was discharged the property in question must be considered to have revested in the mortgagor on his discharge in the absence of any order to the contrary by the court.\r\nWe may now notice some cases on which reliance is placed to suggest that undisposed of property can never vest in the insolvent, even after he gets a discharge.\r\nIn Arjun Das Kundu vs Marchhiya Telinee (1), it was held that \"an absolute order of discharge of an insolvent does not release any property acquired by him before such order from the liability to meet his debts provable in insolvency.\r\n\" That case, however, was only dealing with the effect of section 44 (2) of the Act and it was held that if there was any property which vested in the official receiver either under section 28 (2) or under section 28(4) and that property was not disposed of before the order of discharge, the creditors would still have a right to get their debts discharged by the sale of that property even though they might not have proved the debts at an earlier stage.\r\nThis case does not in our opinion support the proposition contended for by the respon dents.\r\nIt only lays down that the property which remains undisposed of would still be subject to the debts provable under the Act, and this is what in our opinion is the effect of section 67 where only the surplus revests in the insolvent.\r\nThe next case is Kanshi Ram vs Hari Ram (2) there the facts were that a discharge was granted on the re port of the official receiver to the effect that the insolvent 's assets had been completely disposed of.\r\nThereafter it was discovered that some property had (1) I.L.R. (2) A.I.R. (1937) Lah.\r\n542 devolved on the insolvent before his discharge and was not within the knowledge of the receiver.\r\nThe High Court held that such property was liable to meet the debts which had not been paid in full before the discharge.\r\nThis case also in our opinion only lays down that any surplus in the hands of the insolvent after his discharge is liable to the debts provable under the Act if they have not been paid in full, and this is in accordance with the provisions of section 67, for the insolvent is only entitled to that property or money as surplus which remains after payment of his debts in full and after meeting all expenses of the proceedings under the Act.\r\nThe last case to which reference may be made is Parsu vs Balaji (1).\r\nIn that case also the insolvent had been discharged but his debts had not been paid in full.\r\nIt was held in those circumstances that any undisposed of property would still be liable to meet the debts provable under the Act.\r\nThis again in our opinion is in accord with section 67 where the insolvent is only entitled to that surplus which remains after his debts have been paid in full and all the expenses of the proceedings taken under the Act have been met.\r\nTherefore, on a careful consideration of the scheme of the Act and on a review of the authorities which have been cited at the bar, we are of opinion that an insolvent is entitled to get back any undisposed of property as surplus when an absolute order of discharge is made in his favour, subject always to the condition that if any of the debts provable under the Act have not been discharged before the order of discharge, the property would remain liable to dis charge those debts and also meet the expenses of all proceedings taken under the Act till they arc fully met.\r\nThe view of the High Court that the suit is not maintainable is therefore not correct.\r\nThe order of the trial court by which it held that the suit was maintainable and provided that notice should be (1) I.L.R. 543 given to the receiver in insolvency application No. 48 of 1939 to consider if be wanted the property to be made available for distribution amongst creditors, is correct.\r\nNow we come to the second point raised before the High Court, namely, the effect of the will of Ganpatrao.\r\nBy the first clause of the will, Ganpatrao appointed three executors.\r\nThe bequest in favour of Annapumabai was in these terms : \"The entire immovable property situate at the village of Dahisar, Taluka Kalyan, consisting of lands and tenements etc.\r\nis given to my senior wife, Annapoorna.\r\nDuring her life time she shall enjoy, as owner, the income therefrom, in any manner she may like.\r\nNo one shall have (any) right, title or interest therein.\r\n\" The bequest in favour of Sarswatibai was in these terms : \"The entire immovable property situate at the village of Nagaon, Taluka Kalyan, consisting of lands and tenements etc.\r\nis given to my junior wife, Sarswati.\r\nDuring her life time, she shall enjoy, as owner, only the income therefrom in any manner she may like.\" Then there was another clause which gave them some property jointly, which was in these terms : \"The property consisting of a dwelling house and other structures and open space etc.\r\nsituate at Thana shall remain with my two wives.\r\nHence, they should live amicably and enjoy the same.\r\n\" The High Court has held that the estate given to Annapurnabai in the lands at village Dahisar and 544 to Sarswatibai in the lands at village Nagaon and the estate given to them, in the house at Thana was an absolute estate subject to defeasance of the estate on their deaths in case a son was adopted by Annapurnabai.\r\nIt is true that the two clauses with respect to the demise of properties in villages Dahisar and Nagaon to the two widows use the word \"owner\" ; but we have to read the clauses as a whole together with the surrounding circumstances then prevailing as also in contrast to the other clauses in the will to determine the intention of the testator.\r\nNow the clause with respect to village Dahisar is that the property in Dahisar was given to Annapurnabai.\r\nand then goes on to say that during her life time she would enjoy as owner the income there from in any manner she liked and no one else would have any right, title or interest therein Reading the clause as a whole it seems to us fairly clear that the intention of the testator was that the property given to Annapurnabai was for her life and she was entitled to enjoy the income therefrom in any manner she liked without any interference by any one.\r\nIf the testator 's intention had been to give an absolute estate to Annapurnabai, there was no reason why he should have gone on to say in that clause, \"during her life time she shall enjoy as owner the income therefrom, in any manner she may like\", for that would have been unnecessary in the case of a person who was given an absolute estate.\r\nTherefore these words appearing in the second clause are clearly words of, limitation and show on the reading of the whole clause that the intention of the testator was to confer a life estate on Annapurnabai.\r\nIn the case of the property in village Nagaon, the matter is clearer still, for the testator said that Sarswatibai shall enjoy as owner, only the income during her life time.\r\nThese are clear words of limitation and show on reading the clause as a whole that the 545 intention of the testator was to confer only life estate on Sarswatibai.\r\nAs to the clause relating to the dwelling house etc.\r\nin Thana, it is remarkable that that clause does not even use the word \"given\" ; it only says that the dwelling house etc. \" 'shall remain with my two wives\" i.e. that they will be in possession so long as they live.\r\nThe further sentence that they should live amicably and enjoy the same, makes in our opinion no difference to the intention of the testator, which is clear from the fact that he wanted these properties to remain with his two wives, i.e. he was only giving them the possession of the property for enjoyment for their lives.\r\nIn this connection it may be well to contrast the language of some other clauses in the will where the bequest was obviously of an absolute estate.\r\nTake the bequest relating to Sirdhon village in favour of Balkrishna Waman Kharkar.\r\nIt is in these terms : \"The entire immovable property situate , 'at Sirdhon village, taluka Panvel, consisting of lands and tenements etc.\r\nis given to Chiranjiv Balkrishan Waman Kharkar.\r\nHe shall en 'JOY the same as owner.\r\nNeither my two wives nor others whosoever shall have any right, title or interest etc.\r\nwhatever therein.\r\n\" This is a clear bequest of an absolute estate.\r\nThere is no mention of any income in this clause and also no mention of the life time of the legatee.\r\nObviously, therefore, where the testator was intending to bequeath an absolute estate he used entirely different language from that used in the three clauses with respect to his wives.\r\nContrast again the language relating to the bequest of movable property in favour of the two wives.\r\nThat clause is in these terms : \" Movable property such as ornaments and trinkets and clothes and raiments etc.\r\nwhich 546 may have been given to any party shall remain with the said party and my two wives shall be fully entitled thereto.\r\nThey shall deal with the same in any manner they like.\r\n\" The use of the words \"fully entitled\" clearly indicates the bequest of absolute estate so far as movable property is concerned ; but we find no similar words in the clauses relating to bequests of property in villages Dahisar, Nagaon and Thana.\r\nThis conclusion as to the nature of the interest bequeathed to the two wives is strengthened by another provision in the will.\r\nUnder that provision Annapurnabai was authorised to adopt a fit boy from amongst the family, on the advice of the executors.\r\nIt was also provided that the adopted son shall have no right of any kind whatever to the movable and immovable properties so long as Annapumabai remained alive.\r\nBut on her death he was to be entitled to these.\r\nproperties.\r\nIt was further provided that on the death of Sarswatibai the adopted son would become entitled to the immovable property bequeathed of her.\r\nNow if the estate bequeathed to Annapurnabai and Sarswatibai was anabsolute estate it is difficult to see how the testator could provide that on the death of Annapurnabai and saraswatibai the properties bequeathed to them would go to the adopted son.\r\nThe holder of an absolute estate would be entitled to sell it if she so desired, and therefore there could be no provision in the will that on the deaths of Annapumabai and Sarswatibai, the property bequeathed to them would go to the adopted son.\r\nThis provision therefore read with the provisions in the three clauses relating to the bequests of properties in Dahisar; Nagaon and Thana clearly shows that the bequest of those properties in favour of the two wives was only a life estate.\r\nWe cannot therefore agree with the 547 High Court that the estate given to Annapumabai and Sarswatibai whether in Dahisar, Nagaon or Thana was an absolute estate.\r\nIn our opinion it was life estate only.\r\nIt may also be added that Ganpatrao died,, in 1894 when it was more usual to give life estate to widows and the terms in the various clauses on the will are in our opinion in consonance with the prevailing practice in those times.\r\nIn the view that we have taken it follows that the judgment of the High Court must be set aside.\r\nHowever as the High Court has only considered these two questions, the case will have to be remanded so that the High Court may go into the other issues raised and decided by the trial court.\r\nLastly we may refer to another contention on behalf of the respondents.\r\nIt appears that Shamdas Narayandas and jaigopal Narayandas purchased property in village Dhokali Manpada in Taluka and sub division of Thana, described as lot No. 8 in the first schedule to the 'plaint.\r\nIt appears that there was one sale deed in favour of these two defendants.\r\nOf these defendants, jaigopal_Narayandas died on April 19, 1960, after the decree of the High Court which was given on March 7, 1957, and also after the grant of the certificate by the High Court in May, 1958, and the order admitting the appeal by the High Court in April, 1959.\r\nThe record was despatched to this Court in 1962.\r\nNo application was however made to the High Court till August 13, 1962, for substitution of the heirs of jaigopal Narayandas.\r\nWhen the application was made in August 1962, for substitution, the High Court dismissed it on Jannary 9. 1963, on the ground of limitation.\r\nThere was then a review application filed before the High Court, which was also dismissed on February 12, 1963.\r\nThereafter the petition of appeal was filed in this Court on March 13, 1963.\r\nThen on April 3, 1963, an application was made to this 548 Court for substitution of the heirs of Jaigopal Nara a as.\r\nThe respondents contend that as the heirs of jaigopal Narayandas were not brought on the recordwithin the time allowed by law, the entire appeal abates.\r\nWe are of opinion that the interests of the various defendants who are in possession of various properties are independent and therefore the whole of the appeal cannot abate because the heirs of certain deceased defendants in possession of one property have not been brought on the record.\r\nSo far as lot.\r\nNo. 8 is concerned it was the common progerty of Shamdas Narayandas and jaigopal Narayan as, which they apparently acquired by one sale decd.\r\nWe are not prepared to condone the delay in bringing the heirs of jaigopal Narayandas on the record and therefore dismiss the application dated April 3, 1963.\r\nThe effect of this will be that the suit will abate in so far as the property in lot No. 8 is concerned.\r\nIt is not shown that the interest of the two purchasers who are presumably members of an undivided family were separate and distinct and so there cannot be partial abatement only in regard to the share of the deceased purchaser; but that cannot affect the appeal in so far as the property in other lots is concerned.\r\nThe High Court on remand will therefore go into the other issues with respect to properties in lots other than lot No. 8.\r\nWe therefore allow the appeal and remand the case to the High Court for decision on other issues so far as lots (other than lot No. 8) in the first schedule to the plaint are concerned.\r\nSo far as lot No. 8 is concerned, the appeal abates and is dismissed.\r\nIn the circumstances we pass no order as to the costs of the appeal with respect to lot No. 8, so far as the costs of the appeal with respect to other lots are concerned, the respondents will pay the costs of the appellant including advocate 's fee of this court & the Court fees also.\r\nAppeal allowed.\r\nCase remanded.",

Bhasme for the Appellant.\r\nDr. Y.S. Chitale and R.S. Nariman for the Respondent No. 16.\r\nMrs. Karanjawala and Ms. Meenakshi Arora for the Caveator.\r\nThe following order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R Special leave granted against Respondent No. 16 in so far as relief claimed against Respondent No. 16.\r\nThe Charity Commissioner of State of Maharashtra has approached this Court by way of Special leave in order to seek redress in respect of the observations made by the Division Bench of the High Court casting reflections on the conduct of the officials of the organization and in regard to their competence to decide matters in their quasi judicial capacity.\r\nHe has also sought a direction against Respondent No. 16 who is present by caveat.\r\nWe are constrained to observe that the High Court might well have avoided casting reflections against the Deputy Charity Commissioner who was merely discharging his quasi judicial functions under the Bombay Public Trusts Act.\r\nHe should have been permitted to discharge his functions in regard to the issues arising before him in the light of his own independent perspective.\r\nThe 951 observations made by learned Single Judge, by the very nature of things, were of a tentative nature as the learned Single Judge was deciding the matter arising out of an interlocutary proceeding.\r\nIn fact, the observations made by the learned Single Judge on merits in regard to the interpretation of the clauses of the Will could not have influenced even the trial court.\r\nBesides, an appeal to the Division Bench was pending.\r\nUnder the circumstances, taking a view which was different from the view reflected in the judgment of the learned Single Judge on the part of the Deputy Charity Commissioner could by no stretch of imagination be said to have been made in scant regard of the judgment of the High Court.\r\nNor could it ever have been construed as exhibiting disrespect for the High Court.\r\nThe Division Bench went far too far in observing to the effect that what the Deputy Charity Commissioner had done in discharging his quasi judicial functions would constitute contempt of Court.\r\nLearned Deputy Charity Commissioner was entitled to take his own view subject to his decision being questioned in accordance with law before the High Court.\r\nThe observations made against the Deputy Charity Commissioner were therefore altogether uncalled for and unfair.\r\nWe, therefore, direct that these observations be treated as non existent.\r\nWe wish to make it clear that the Deputy Charity Commissioner has not been amiss or at fault in the smallest respect in taking the view which commended itself to him and which he was at full liberty to take under the law.\r\nWe wish to place on record that nothing said in the judgment of the Division Bench in Appeal No. 969 of 1974 should be construed as a reflection on the learned Deputy Charity Commissioner.\r\nWe are also of the view that the observations made in regard to the mode of recruitment to the office in question were also uncalled for and should be treated as non existent.\r\nIn the facts and circumstances of the case the Division Bench might will have permitted the Charity Commissioner to be substituted for the appellant before the Court for he was merely making sincere endeavour in the discharge of his official duties to protect the interest of the charity as he was duty bound to do, so as to be true to his office.\r\nWe have heard the learned counsel for the Respondent No. 16 in regard to the relief claimed against him.\r\nBoth counsel are agreeable to the directions which follow.\r\nThe status quo in regard to the property in question shall be maintained and Respondent No. 16 shall not get executed or obtain a sale deed in respect of the property in his favour or in favour of his nominees or assignees till the question is finally disposed of by the 952 Assistant Charity Commissioner or by the Appellate Authority, if any appeal is carried.\r\nThe Assistant Charity Commissioner before whom the matter is pending will have full liberty to decide the matter in accordance with law in the light of his own perception of the matter without being influenced one way or the other by any observation made in the judgment of the learned Single Judge or in the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court which have given rise to the present Special Leave Petition.\r\nWe express no opinion on merits in regard to the effect of the relevant clauses of the Will as indeed we cannot do.\r\nThe Assistant Charity Commissioner will dispose of the matter pending before him with expedition preferably within the outside limit of six months.\r\nThe matter shall stand disposed of accordingly.\r\nG.N.

Shukla, for the appellants.\r\nC. B. Agarwala, and J. P. Goyal, for the respondent No. I. 1963.\r\nMay 3: The judgement of the Court was delivered by RAGHBAR DAYAL J.\r\nThe facts leading to this appeal, by special leave, are these.\r\nNine 551 persons, including Kedar Nath, instituted a suit for ejectment and recovery of rent against two defendants on the allegation that defendant No. I was the tenant inchief who had sub let the premises to defendant No. 2.\r\nThe suit for ejectment was decreed against both the defendants and for arrears of rent against defendant No. 1.\r\nOn appeal by defendant No. 2 the District judge set aside the decree for ejectment against defendant No. 2 and confirmed the rest of the decree against defendant No. 1.\r\nIt is against this decree that the nine original plaintiffs filed the second appeal in the High Court on February 29, 1952.\r\nKedar Nath, appellant No. 3, died on September 8, 1955.\r\nIn view of rr. 3 and 11 of O. XXII of the Code of Civil Procedure, hereinafter called the Code, the appeal abated so far as Kedar Nath was concerned as no application for bringing his legal representatives on the record was made within the prescribed time.\r\nOn October 1, 1956, two applications were filed in the High Court One was an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act for the condonation of the delay in filing the application for substitution of the heirs in placec of Kedar Nath.\r\nThe other was the application for substitution in which it was prayed that Bithal Das and Banarsi Das, the sons of Kedar Nath, deceased, be substituted in place of the deceased appellant as they were his heirs and representatives.\r\nThese two applications were dismissed on May 1, 1957, with the result that the appeal stood abated as against Kedar Nath.\r\nBhagwati Prasad, appellant No. 9 also died on July 2,1956.\r\nHis widow, Remeshwari Devi, was brought on the record in his place.\r\nWhen the appeals of the appellants other than Kedar Nath came up for hearing on September 1, 1958, a preliminary objection was taken for the, 552 respondent that the entire appeal had abated.\r\nMr. jagdish Swarup, learned counsel appearing for the appellants, contended that the deceased belonged to a joint Hindu family and other members of the family were already on the record and that it was not necessary to bring on record any other person.\r\nHe further stated that the appeal could not be said to have abated in the particular circumstances.\r\nThe Court allowed the appellants time for filing an affidavit stating that the deceased was a member of the joint Hindu family and other relevant facts.\r\nOn September 8, 1958, an affidavit was filed by Suraj Prasad Misra pairokar of the appellants.\r\nPara 9 of the Affidavit stated that Lala Ram Chandra Prasad, appellant No. 8, managed the family properties including the one in dispute which was joint and looked after the affairs of the properties and acted for and on behalf of the family and was 'already on the record.\r\nA counter affidavit was filed stating that the allegations in para 9 of the affidavit were misleading, that there was no allegation in the affidavit that the family was a joint Hindu family and that the true facts were that the family of the plaintiffsappellants was not a joint family, that the members were separated, that Lala Ram Chandra Prasad was not karta of the joint Hindu family, that the plaintiffs were assessed to income tax separately and that the property in dispute was not joint family property or even joint property.\r\nA rejoinder affidavit was then filed by Sri Narain, general agent of the appellants stating that the aforesaid statements in the counteraffidavit were misleading and irrelevant and re affirming that Ram Chandra Prasad managed the house property of the family including the one in dispute and that he looked after the affairs of the house property and acted for and on behalf of the family just as other members of the family looked after other affairs including the business belonging to the family.\r\n553 At the hearing of the appeal of the surviving appellants, the only point which was urged for consideration seems to have been that the surviving appellants were competent to continue the appeal in view of O.XLI, r. 4, C. P. C.\r\nThis contention was repelled in view of the full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court reported in Baij Nath vs Ram Bharose (1), as the interests of the surviving appellants and the deceased appellant were joint and indivisible and as in the event of the success of the appeal there would be two inconsistent and contradictory decrees.\r\nIt accordingly dismissed the appeal.\r\nIt is against this decree that this appeal has been filed after obtaining special leave.\r\nMr. Sarjoo Prasad, learned counsel for the appellants, has raised two points.\r\nOne is that the provision of r. 2 of O. XXII and not of r. 3 of that Order apply to the facts of this case as the nine appellants constitute a joint Hindu family and the surviving plaintiffs could continue the appeal.\r\nThe second point is that if the provisions of r. 3 of O.XXII applied and the appeal of Kedar Nath had abated, the provisions of r. 4 of O.XLI have not been correctly construed in Baij Nath vs Ram Bharose (1) and Ramphal Sahu vs Babu Satdeo Jha (2).\r\nWe see no force in the first contention.\r\nWe have already referred to the contents of the various affidavits filed by the parties subsequent to the point being raised that Kedar Nath, the deceased appellant and the surviving appellants constituted a joint Hindu family.\r\nThey clearly indicate that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellants made no averment that Kedar Nath and the surviving appellants formed a joint Hindu family, even though time had been given to them for filing an affidavit stating such a fact.\r\nThe inference is obvious, and (1) I.L.R. [1953) All, Pat, 870, 554 is that these people did not form a joint Hindu family as alleged by the respondents.\r\nIt is further of significance that the application made on October 1, 1956, for substituting the sons of Kedar Nath in his place stated that they were his heirs and legal representatives.\r\nThe application was on the basis that Kedar Nath was not a member of the joint Hindu family.\r\nWe are, therefore, of opinion that it is not proved that Kedar Nath, deceased, and the other appellants constituted a joint Hindu family that the right to appeal survived to the surviving appellants alone and that they could have continued their appeal in view of r. 2 of of XXII of the Code.\r\nThe second contention really is that the surviving appellants could have instituted the appeal against the entire decree in view of the provisions of O. XLI, r. 4 of the Code, that they were, therefore, competent to continue the appeal even after the death of Kedar Nath and the abatement of the appeal so far as he was concerned, that the Court could have reversed or varied the whole decree in favour of all the original plaintiffs and could have granted relief 'with respect to the rights and interests of Kedar Nath as well.\r\nWe do not agree with this contention Rule 4 of O.XLI reads: \"Where there are more plaintiffs or more defendants than one in a suit, and the decree appealed from proceeds on any ground common to all the plaintiffs or to all the defendants, any one of the plaintiffs or of the defendants may appeal from the whole decree, and there upon the appellate Court may reverse or vary the decree in the favour of all the plaintiffs,or defendants, as the case may be.\" These provisions enable one of the plaintiffs or one of the defendants to file an appeal against the entire 555 decree.\r\nThe second appeal filed in the High Court was not filed by any one or by even some of the plaintiffs as an appeal against the whole decree, but was filed by all the plaintiffs jointly, and, therefore, was not an appeal to which the provisions of r. 4 O.XLI could apply.\r\nThe appeal could not have been taken to be an appeal filed by some of the plaintiffs against the whole decree in pursuance of the provisions of r. 4 of O.XLI from the date when the appeal abated so far as Kedar Nath was concerned.\r\nIf the appeal could be treated to have been so filed, then, it would have been filed beyond the period prescribed for the appeal.\r\nAt that time, the decree stood against the surviving plaintiffs and the legal representatives of Kedar Nath.\r\nThe legal representatives could not have taken advantage of r. 4 of O. XLI.\r\nIt follows that r. 4 of O. XLI would not be available to the surviving plaintiffs at that time.\r\nFurther, the principle behind the provisions of r. 4 seems to be that any one of the plaintiffs or defendants, in filing such an.\r\nappeal, represents all the other non appealing plaintiffs or defendants as he wants the reversal or modification of the decree in favour of them as well, in view of the fact that the original decree proceeded on a ground common to all of them.\r\nKedar Nath was alive when the appeal was filed and was actually one of the appellants.\r\nThe surviving appellants cannot be said to have filed the appeal as representing Kedar Nath.\r\nKedar Nath 's appeal has abated and the decree in favour of the respondents has become final against his legal representatives.\r\nHis legal representatives cannot eject the defendants from the premises in suit.\r\nIt will be against the scheme of the Code to hold that r. 4 of O. XLI empowered the Court to pass a decree in favour of the legal representatives of the 556 deceased Kedar Nath on hearing an appeal by the surviving appellants even though the decree against him has become final.\r\nThis Court said in State ' of Punjab vs Nathu Ram(1).\r\n\"The abatement of an appeal means not only that the decree between the appellant and the deceased respondent had become final, but also, as a necessary corollary, that the appellate Court cannot, in any way, modify that decree directly or indirectly.\r\nThe reason is plain.\r\nIt is that in the absence of the legal representatives of the deceased respondent, the appellate Court cannot determine anything between the appellant and the legal representatives which may affect the rights of the legal representatives under the decree.\r\nIt is immaterial that the modification which the Court will do is one to which exception can or cannot be taken.\" No question of the Provisions of r. 4 of O.XLI overriding the provisions of r. 9 of O. XXII arises.\r\nThe two deal with different stages of the appeal and provide for different contingencies.\r\nRule 4 of 0 XLI applies to the stage when an appeal is filed and empowers one of the plaintiffs or defendants to file an appeal against the entire decree in certain circumstances.\r\nHe can take advantage of this provision, but he may not.\r\nOnce an appeal has been filed by all the plaintiffs the provisions of 0 XLI, r. 4 became unavailable.\r\nOrder XXII operates during the pendency of an appeal and not at its institution.\r\nIf some party dies during the ' pendency of the appeal, his legal representatives have to be brought on the record within the period of limitation.\r\nIf that is not done, the appeal by the deceased appellant abates and does not proceed any further.\r\nThere is thus no inconsistency between the previsions of r. 9 of O. XXII and those of r. 4 of O~. XLI, C.P.C. They operate at different stages and provide for (1) [1962] 2 S.C. R. 636 557 different contingencies.\r\nThere is nothing common in their provisions which make the provisions of one interfere in any way with those of the other.\r\nWe do not consider it necessary to discuss the cases referred to at the hearing.\r\nSuffice it to say that the majority of the High Courts have taken the correct view viz., that the appellate Court has no power to proceed with the appeal and to reverse and vary the decree in favour of all the plaintiffs or defendants under O. XLI, r. 4 when the decree proceeds on a ground common to all the plaintiffs or defendants, if all the plaintiffs or the defendants appeal from the decree and any of them dies and the appeal abates so far as he is concerned under O.XXII, r. 3.\r\nSee : Ramphal Sahu vs Babu Satdeo Jha (1); Amin Chand vs Baldeo Sahai Ganga Sahai(2), Baij Nath vs Ram Bharose (3); Nanak vs Ahmad Ali (4); Pyarelal vs Sikhar Chand (5); Raghu Sutar vs Nrusingha Nath (6); Venkata Ram Rao vs Narayana (7); Sonahar Ali vs Mukbul Ali (8).\r\nThe Bombay,, Calcutta and Madras High Courts have taken a differentview : see Shripad Balwant vs Nagu KushebaSatulal Bhattachariya vs Asiruddin ShaikhSomasundaram Chettiar vs Vaithilinga Mudaliar OrderXLI, r. 33 is of no greater help to the contention of the appellants that their appeal could continue even though the appeal by Kedar Nath had abated, as the Court could have passed a decree in favour of the rights and interests of Kedar Nath, deceased, as well.\r\nThis rule reads : \"The Appellate Court shall have power to pass any decree and make any order which ought to have been passed or made and to pass or make such further or other decree or order as the case may require, an( this power may be exer cised by the Court notwithstanding that the (1) I.L.R. [1953] 2 All.\r\nLah.667 (3) I.L.R. [1953] 2 All.\r\n(6) A.I.R. 1959 Orissa 148.\r\n(7) A.I.R. 1963 A.P. 168 (8) A I.R. (9) I.R.R. (10) I.L.R. (11) I.L.R. 558 appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although such respondents or parties may not have filed any appeal or objection : Provided that the Appellate Court shall not make any order under section 35A, in pursuance of any objection on which the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has omitted or refused to make such order.\r\n\" This rule is under the sub heading 'judgment in appeal '.\r\nRule 31 provides that the judgment of the Appellate Court shall be in writing and shall state inter alia the relief to which the appellant is entitled in case the decree appealed from is reversed or varied.\r\nRule 32 provides as to what the judgment may direct and states that the judgment may be for confirming, varying or reversing the decree from which the appeal is preferred, or, if the parties to the appeal agree as to the form which the decree in appeal shall take, or as to the order to be made in appeal, the Appellate Court may pass a decree or make an order accordingly.\r\nThe reversal or variation in the decree would, therefore, be in accordance with what the appellant had been found to be entitled.\r\nThe decree therefore, is not to be reversed or varied with respect to such rights to which the appellant is not found entitled.\r\nRule 33 really provides as to what the Appellate Court can find the appellant entitled to.\r\nIt empowers the Appellate Court to pass any decree and make any order which ought to have been passed or made in the proceedings before it and thus could have reference only to the nature of the decree or Order in so far as it affects the rights of the appellant.\r\nIt further empowers the Appellate Court to pass or make such further or other decree or Order as the case may require.\r\nThe Court is thus given wide discretion to pass such decrees and Orders as 559 the interests of justice demand.\r\nSuch a power is to be exercised in exceptional cases when its non exercise will lead to difficulties in the adjustment of rights of the various parties.\r\nA case like the present is not a case of such a kind.\r\nWhen the legal representatives of the deceased appellant and the surviving appellants were negligent in not taking steps for substitution, the Court is not to exercise its discretion in favour of such a party.\r\nThe discretionary power cannot be exercised to nullify the effect of the abatement of the appeal so far as Kedar Nath is concerned.\r\nIn fact such an exercise of power will lead to the existence of two contradictory decrees between the heirs of Kedar Nath and the respondents, one passed by the appellate Court and another to the contrary effect by the Court below which has attained finality consequent on the abatement of the appeal in so far as they are concerned.\r\nThis is always avoided.\r\nRule 33 deals with a matter different from the matter dealt with by r. 9 of O. XXII and no question of its provisions overriding those of r. 9 of O. XXII or vice versa arises.\r\nIn Mahomed Khaleel Shirazi & Sons vs Los Panneries Lyonnaises (1) it was held that O. XLI, r. 33 was not intended to apply to an appeal which was not a competent appeal against a party under the Code or under the Letters Patent 'of the High Court.\r\nThis principle applies with equal force in the present case.\r\nThe appeal by the surviving appellants is not competent in the circumstances of the case and, therefore, the provisions of 0.\r\nXLI, r. 33 are not applicable to it.\r\nWe are, therefore, of opinion that the High Court could not have heard the appeal of the surviving appellants when the appeal by kedar Nath had (1) 53 I.A 84 560 abated as all the appellants had a common right and interest in getting a decree of ejectment against defendant No. 2 and such decree could have been on a ground common to all of them.\r\nThe defendant cannot be ejected from the premises when he has a right to remain in occupation of the premises on the basis of the decree holding that Kedar Nath, one of the persons having a joint interest in letting out the property could not have ejected him.\r\nIt is not possible for the defendant to continue as tenant of one of the landlords and not as a tenant of the others when all of them had a joint right to eject him or to have him as their tenant.\r\nWe, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\r\nAppeal dismissed.",

Setalvad, Attorney General for India, section N. Andley, J. B. Dadachanji and Rameshwar Nath, for the appellant.\r\nK. B. Choudhuri, for the respondents.\r\n702 1960.\r\nJanuary 12.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR J.\r\nWhen does an employer get a right to prefer an appeal against a direction made under sub section\r\n(3) of section 15 of the (4 of 1936) (hereinafter called the Act)? That is the short question which arises for our decision in the present group of four appeals.\r\nThe decision of this question depends on the construction of section 17 (1)(a) of the Act.\r\nIn dealing with the question thus posed by the present group of appeals we will refer to the facts in Civil Appeal No. 75 of 1956, and our decision in it would govern the three remaining appeals.\r\nCivil Appeal No.75 of 1956 which has been brought to this Court by special leave arises from a dispute between the General Manager of the Times of India Press.\r\n, Bombay, owned by Benett Coleman & Co, Ltd., (hereinafter called the appellant) and some of the employees in his service (hereinafter called the respondents).\r\nIn November 1953, 1,066 applications were made by the Vice President of the Times of India Indian Employees Union on behalf of some of the respondents before Mr. C. P. Fernandes, the authority appointed under the Act in which a claim was made for arrears of increments alleged to have been withheld by the appellant from July 1, 1951, to September 30, 1953, as also for increased dearness allowance from January 1, 1953, to August 31, 1953.\r\nThe authority dealt with the whole group of the said applications as a single application under section 16(3) of the Act, and held that the claim made by the respondents for increased dearness allowance was not justified.\r\nIn regard to the claim of arrears of increments alleged to have been withheld the authority rejected the claim made by 761 employees and allowed the same in respect of 305 employees.\r\nIn the result the order passed by the authority on 31 12 1954 directed the appellant to deposit Rs. 22,698 for payment to the said 305 employees.\r\nThe direction thus issued by the authority gave rise to two appeals before the Small Causes Court at Bombay, which is the appellate authority appointed 703 under the Act.\r\nAppeal No. 11 of 1955 was filed by the appellant while Appeal No. 187 of 1954 was filed by the respondents.\r\nMeanwhile the question about the extent of the right conferred on the employer to prefer an appeal by section 17(1)(a) of the Act had been considered by the Bombay High Court in Laxman Pandu & Ors.\r\nvs Chief Mechanical Engineer, Western Railway (B.B. & C.I. Railway), Lower Parel, Bombay (1); and it had been held that under the said section the employer gets a right of appeal only if the order of the authority under the Act awards payment of an amount of Rs. 300 or more in respect of a single individual worker; the right does not exist if the order awards a sum exceeding Rs. 300 collectively to an unpaid group of workers every one of whom gets an amount under Rs. 300.\r\nFollowing this decision the appellate authority held that the appeal preferred by the appellant was incompetent and so dismissed it.\r\nThe appellant then applied for and obtained special leave from this Court to prefer an appeal against the said appellate decision; and so the main point raised by the appeal is about the construction of section 17(1)(a) of the Act.\r\nThe Act has been passed in 1936 with a view to regulate the payment of wages to certain classes of persons employed in industry.\r\nSection 15(1) of the Act authorises the State Government by notification in the official Gazette to appoint any Commissioner for Workmen 's Compensation or other officer with experience as a Judge of a Civil Court or as a stipendiary Magistrate to be the authority to hear and decide for any specified area all claims arising out of deductions from the wages, or delay in payment of wages of persons employed or paid in that area.\r\nSection 7 has provided for deductions which may be made from wages.\r\nAny deductions made not in accordance with the said section and contrary to the provisions of the Act as well as wages the payment of which has been delayed can be brought before the authority under sub s (2) of section 15.\r\nSub section (3) of section 15 empowers the authority to deal with the applications made under sub section\r\n(2) and to direct a refund to (1) , 704 the employed person of the amount deducted or the payment of delayed wages together with the payment of such compensation as the authority may think fit, not exceeding ten times the amount deducted in the former case and not exceeding Rs. 10 in the latter.\r\nSub section (4) provides that in cases where the authority is satisfied that the application made by the employee was either malicious or vexatious it may direct that a penalty not exceeding Rs. 50 be paid to the employer or other persons responsible for the payment of wages by the applicant.\r\nIt would thus be seen that section 15 provides for the making of applications by the employees and for their decision in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\r\nIt is necessary to refer to section 16 as well before dealing with the question of the construction of section 17(1)(a).\r\nSection 16 provides for the making of a single application in respect of claims from unpaid group.\r\nSection 16(1) provides that employed persons are said to belong to the same unpaid group if they are borne on the same establishment and if their wages for the same period or periods have remained unpaid after the day fixed by section 5.\r\nSub section (2) provides for the making of a single application under section 15 on behalf of or in respect of any number of employed persons belonging to the same unpaid group, and prescribes that in such a case the maximum compensation that may be awarded under sub section\r\n(3) of section 15 shall be Rs. 10 per head.\r\nSubsection (3) then provides that the authority may deal with any number of separate pending applications presented under section 15 in respect of persons belonging to the same unpaid group as a single application presented under sub section\r\n(2) of the said section, and the provisions of that sub section shall apply accordingly.\r\nThus the effect of section 16 is that a single application may be made on behalf of any number of employed persons belonging to the same unpaid group, or if separate applications are made by employed persons belonging to the same unpaid group they may be consolidated and tried as a single application.\r\nLet us now read section 17 which provides for appeals.\r\nSection 17(1) provides that an appeal against a 705 direction made under sub section\r\n(3) or sub section\r\n(4) of s 15 may be preferred within thirty days of the date on which the direction was made, in a Presidency town before the Court of Small Causes and elsewhere before the District Court (a) by the employer or other person responsible for the payment of wages under section 3, if the total sum directed to be paid by way of wages and compensation exceeds Rs. 300, or (b) by an employed person, if the total amount of wages claimed to have been withheld from him or from the unpaid group to which he belonged exceeds Rs. 50, or (c) by any person directed to pay a penalty under sub.s.\r\n(4) of section 15.\r\nSub section (2) of section 17 makes the directions made under sub section\r\n(3) and sub section\r\n(4) of section 15 final save as provided in sub section (1).\r\nOn a plain reading of section 17(1)(a) it seems fairly clear that the only test which has to be satisfied by the appellant before preferring an appeal against a direction issued under section 15(3) is that the total sum directed to be paid by him should exceed Rs. 300.\r\nWhere a single application has been made on behalf of a number of employed persons belonging to the same unpaid group under section 16, sub section\r\n(2), and a direction has been issued for the payment of the specified amount, it is the said specified amount that must be considered in deciding whether the test prescribed by section 17(1)(a) is satisfied or not.\r\nThe view taken by the Bombay High Court, however, is that section 17(1)(a) is applicable only where the amount directed to be paid to each single applicant exceeds Rs. 300.\r\nIn other words, on this view the expression \" the total sum directed to be paid \" used in section 17(1)(a) is construed to mean the total sum directed to be paid to each individual applicant, and that clearly involves the addition of certain words in the section.\r\nIf the application is made by a single employee an appeal can be preferred by the employer against the direction issued in such an application if the total sum directed to be paid to the applicant exceeds Rs. 300; but if a single application is made on behalf of several employees belonging to the same unpaid group the test to be applied is not whether a direction has been issued that the employer 99 706 should pay Rs. 300 or more to each one of the applicants; the test clearly is whether a direction has been issued on the said single application calling upon the employer to pay to the applicants Rs. 300 or more.\r\nReading section 17(1)(a) by itself we feel no difficulty in reaching this conclusion.\r\nIt is, however, urged that in construing section 17(1)(a) it would be relevant and material to compare and contrast its provisions with those of cl.\r\n(b) of section 17, sub section\r\nProviding for the right of an employee to make an appeal this clause requires that the total amount of wages claimed to have been withheld from him or from the unpaid group to which he belonged should exceed Rs. 50.\r\nIt is emphasised that this clause refers expressly to the case of an individual employee as well as the cases of employees belonging to an unpaid group; and the argument is that since cl.\r\n(a) does not use the words \" unpaid group \" it indicates that the direction about the payment of the amount prescribed by the said clause has reference to each individual employee.\r\nWe are not impressed by this argument.\r\nSince the Act has provided for the making of a single application on behalf of a number of employed persons belonging to the same unpaid group as well as separate applications made by individual workmen it was unnecessary to refer to the persons employed in the unpaid group while providing for appeals against directions made under section 15(3).\r\nOn the other hand, if the Legislature had intended that the right to prefer an appeal should accrue to the employer only if Rs. 300 or more are directed to be paid to each individual employee it would have used appropriate additional words in cl.\r\nTherefore the argument based upon the use of the words \" unpaid group \" in cl.\r\n(b) is not of any assistance in construing cl.\r\nWe are also inclined to think that it could not have been the intention of the Legislature to confer on the employer the right to prefer an appeal only if Rs. 300 or more are ordered to be paid to each one of the applicants.\r\nIt is true that the policy of the Act is to provide for speedy remedy to the employees in respect of unauthorised deductions made by the employer or 707 in respect of delayed wages; and with that object the Act provides for the appointment of the authority and prescribes the summary procedure for the decision of the claims;butitseemsveryunlikelythatwhereas an appeal by the employee has been permitted by cl.\r\n(b) whenever the amount in dispute happens to be Rs. 50 or more in respect of an individual applicant or in respect of the unpaid group the Legislature could have intended that the employer should have no right of appeal against a direction made on a; single consolidated application, even though the total liability flowing from the said direction may exceed the specified amount of Rs. 300 by several thousands.\r\nIn the present case the amount directed to be paid is more than Rs. 22,000 but it has been held that since each one of the employees is not ordered to be paid Rs. 300 or more there is no right of appeal.\r\nOn general considerations, therefore, the conclusion which we have reached on a fair and reasonable construction of cl.\r\n(a) appears to be well founded.\r\nThere is another point to which reference must be made.\r\nSection 16(3) empowers the authority to consolidate several applications made by individual employees and bear them as a single application as though it was presented under section 16, sub section\r\n(2); and it is urged that this procedural provision cannot and should not have a decisive effect on the employer 's right to prefer an appeal under section 17(1)(a).\r\nIf several applications made by individual employees are not consolidated and heard as a single application under section 16(3) and separate directions are issued, then the employer would have the right to prefer an appeal only where the total amount directed to be paid exceeds Rs. 300.\r\nOn the other hand, if the authority consolidates the said applications and makes a direction in respect of the total amount to be paid to the employees belonging to the unpaid group the employer may be entitled to make an appeal even though each one of the employees receives less than Rs. 300.\r\nIt would be anomalous, it is said, that the right to appeal should depend upon the exercise of discretion vested in the authority under section 16(3).\r\nWe are unable to see the force of this argument.\r\nWe apprehend that 708 ordinarily when several applications are made by the employees belonging to the same unpaid group the authority would prefer to treat the said applications as a single application under section 16(3); but apart from this practical aspect of the matter, if section 16(3) permits the consolidation of the several applications and in consequence of consolidation they are assimilated to the position of a single application contemplated by section 16(2), the only question which has to be considered in dealing with the competence of the appeal is to see whether the direction appealed against satisfies the test of section 17(1)(a), and on that point we feel no hesitation in holding that the test prescribed by section 17(1)(a) is that the direction should be for the payment of an amount exceeding Rs. 300.\r\nBesides, we think it would not be right to assume that it is anomalous if different consequences follow from the adoption of different procedures in trying employees ' claims and an appeal does not lie where several applications are tried separately while it lies where similar applications are heard as a single application under section 16(3).\r\nThis difference is clearly intended by the Legislature.\r\nA similar different consequence is prescribed in the matter of the award of compensation by section 15, sub section\r\n(3) and section 16,sub section\r\n(2) respectively.\r\nTherefore, the argument based on the alleged anomaly cannot have any validity inconstruing section 17(1)(a).\r\nIncidentally, if one or more employees in the same unpaid group are paid an amount exceeding Rs. 300 and the rest are paid less than Rs. 300, on the alternative construction, the employer would be entitled to make an appeal only in respect of a workman to whom more than Rs. 300 is ordered to be paid and not against the others though the total amount directed to be paid to them may exceed by far the amount of Rs. 300.\r\nIn such a case, if the appeal preferred by the employer in respect of the amount ordered to be paid to some of the workmen succeeds that would leave outstanding two conflicting decisions, with the result that a large number of employees in the same unpaid group may get the amount under the direction of the authority while those who were awarded more 709 than Rs. 300 by the authority would get a smaller amount under the decision of the appellate authority.\r\nWe are referring to this anomalous aspect of the matter only for the purpose of showing that where the words used in the relevant clause are clear and unambiguous considerations of a possible hypothetical anomaly cannot affect its plain meaning.\r\nThat is why we prefer to leave anomalies on both sides out of account and confine ourselves to the construction of the words used in section 17(1)(a).\r\nIf the said words had been reasonably capable of two constructions it would have been relevant to consider which of the two constructions would avoid any possible anomalies.\r\nWe would, therefore, hold that the appellate authority was in error in dismissing the appeal preferred before it by the appellant on the ground that it was incompetent under section 17(1)(a).\r\nWe would like to add that the question about the construction of section 17(1)(a) has been considered by the Madras High Court (Union of India, owning the South Indian Railway by the General Manager vs section P. Nataraja Sastrigal & Ors.\r\n(1) and A. C. Arumugam & Ors.\r\nvs Manager, Jawahar Mills Ltd., Salem Junction (2), the Calcutta High Court (Promod Ranjan Sarkar vs R.N. Munllick (3) and Assam High Court (Cachar Cha Sramik Union vs Manager, Martycherra Tea Estate & Anr.\r\n(4) and they have all differed from the view taken by the Bombay High Court and have construed section 17(1)(a) in the same manner as we have done.\r\nThe result is the appeal is allowed, the order of dismissal passed by the appellate authority is set aside and the appeal sent back to it for disposal in accordance with law.\r\nSince the hearing of the appeal has been thus delayed we would direct that the appellate authority should dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible.\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case we would direct that the parties should bear their own costs.\r\nAppeal allowed.\r\n(1) A.I.R. 1952 Mad. 808.\r\n(3) A.I.R. 1959 Cal.\r\n318 S.C.; (2) A.I.R. 1956 Mad. 79.\r\n(4) A.I.R. 1959 Assam 13.",

I.N. Shroff and H.S. Parihar, for the appellants.\r\nS.K. Gambhir, for respondents Nos. 1 and 2.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J.\r\nIn this appeal by special leave, on an application filed by the respondents before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, the High Court struck down the constitu tional validity of sub section\r\n(5) (a) of section 37 of the Madhya Pradesh Krishi Upaj Mandi Adhiniyam, 1972 hereinafter referred to as 'the Act ' (No.\r\n24 of 1973).\r\nThe impugned sub section runs as follows: \"(5) Every commission agent shall be liable (a) to keep the goods of his principal in safe custody without any charge other than the commission payable to him; and\" 620 The High Court thought that this statutory provision places unreasonable restriction on the commission agent and puts great burden on him for storing the goods given to him by the principal without charging the commission for its safe custody.\r\nThe Act is a social piece Of legislation and should have been liberally construed so as to advance the object of the Act and fulfil the aims to be achieved there by.\r\nThe main purpose of the Act is to secure a scientific method of storage, sale, distribution and marketing of agricultural produce and cut out as far as possible middle man 's profit.\r\nThe Act, therefore, contains provisions of a beneficial nature preventing profiteering tendencies.\r\nIt is not, however, the hardship that can be termed unreasonable so as to make a statute unconstitutional.\r\nMoreover, the High Court does not appear to have looked to.\r\nthe scheme of the Act and has in fact completely overlooked the provisions of section 37(4) which runs as follows: \"(4) The commission agent shall recover his commission only from his principal trader at such rates as may be specified in the bye laws including all such expenses as may be incurred by him in storage of the produce and other services rendered by him.\" This section clearly empowers the commission agent to charge such rates as may be specified by the bye laws even for the storage of the Produce and other services rendered by him.\r\nThis provision also does not prevent the commission agent from levying reasonable charges for the storage over and above his commission.\r\nAll that the Act prevents is that the commission agent is prohibited from levying any charges for safe custody from the farmer or the principal.\r\nThis is done in order to attract and lure the farmers to place their goods with commission agents without additional payment of charges for safe custody.\r\nSection 37 (4), however, compen sates the commission agent by authorising him to charge his commission and all expenses which may be incurred by the commission agent in connection with the storage of the produce and the services rendered by him.\r\nThis section, therefore, clearly authorises the commission agent not only to charge his commission from the principal trader but also expenses incurred by him for the purpose of the storage.\r\nThat apart section 2(e) of the Act whiCh defines a \"Commission agent\" empowers him to charge any commission o.r percentage upon the amount involved in such transaction.\r\nFor these reasons, therefore, we do not see any hardship or unreasonableness in the provisions Of section 37(5)(a) of the Act.\r\nThe High Court, therefore, committed an error of law in striking down this provision as unconstitutional.\r\nIn our opinion, therefore, section 37 (5) (a) of the Act is constitu tionally valid.\r\nIn the view we take, it is not necessary to go into the question whether the law violates article 19 of the Constitution which stands suspended during the emergen cy.\r\nThe appeal is accordingly allowed.\r\nThe order of the High Court is quashed.\r\nIn the circumstances, there will be no order as to.\r\ncosts.\r\nM.R.

Court of East Punjab and the principal point argued before us is as to the legality of the deten tion of the appellants under the Preventive Detention Act on the ground that they are engaged in black marketing in cotton piecegoods.\r\nThe Jullundur Wholesale Cloth Syndicate was formed to work out the distribution of cloth under the Government of Punjab Control (Cloth) Order passed under the Essential Supplies Act.\r\nCertain persons who held licences as whole sale dealers in cloth formed themselves into a corporation and all cloth controlled by the Government was distributed in the district to the retail quota holders through them.\r\nThe Government allotted quotas to the retailers and orders were issued by the Government for giving each retailer certain bales under the distribution control.\r\nIf some of the retail licence holders did not take delivery of the quotas allotted to them under the Notification of the 4th of October, 1950, issued by the Government of India, Department of Industries and Supplies, it was, inter alia, provided that the wholesale syndicate may give the bales not so lifted to another retail dealer.\r\nIt may be noted that all along the price for the cloth to be sold wholesale and retail had been fixed under Government orders.\r\nThe Syndi cate was suspected to be dealing in black market and had been warned against its activities by the District Magis trate of Jullundur several times.\r\nOn the 7th of June, 1951, 21 an order was issued by the District Organiser, Civil Sup plies and Rationing, Jullundur, to the managing agents of the wholesale cloth corporation, Jullundur City, intimating that they were strictly forbidden to dispose of any uplifted stock against unexpired terms without his prior permission in writing.\r\nThey were further directed that thenceforth no such stock would be allowed to be sold to an individual retailer, but permission would be granted to sell the same to associations of retailers only.\r\nIt was stated that this letter was not in accordance with clause 5 of the Notifica tion of the Government of India dated the 4th October, 1950, which authorized the wholesale syndicate to be at liberty to sell uplifted cloth to any other retailer or an association of retail dealers of the same district.\r\nIt may be further noted that the Cotton Cloth Control Order was in operation even prior to 1950.\r\nFor some time control on the distribu tion of cloth was lifted but the price remained under the control of the Government.\r\nDuring that time it has been alleged that the appellants and several others sold cloth at rates higher than those fixed by the Government.\r\nEven when the distribution and price were both controlled, the manu facturing mills were allowed to sell at prices fixed by the Government a certain percentage of cloth which was not taken by the Government under its control.\r\nThis was described as free sale cloth and it was alleged that the appellants and several others were doing black marketing in this free sale cloth.\r\nBy an order passed by the District Magistrate on 19th June, 1951, he directed that the appellants be detained under section 3 (2) of the Preventive Detention Act to prevent them from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies of cloth, essential to the communi ty.\r\nOn the 2nd July, 1951, the District Magistrate, Jullun dur, directed that the appellants be committed to District Jail, Jullundur, from the 2nd July until the 1st October, 1951.\r\nThe appellants were detained accordingly.\r\nThe grounds for their detention were given to them on the morn ing of the 6th July.\r\nThe grounds set out the activities of 22 the appellants as managing agents or partners in different firms or employees of the said firms or corporations.\r\nIt was stated ,that they had been disposing of most of the stocks of cloth received for the Jullundur District in the black market at exhorbitant rates from June, 1949, to Octo ber, 1950, during the period when control on distribution was removed and that even after the reimposition of that control in October, 1950, they disposed of cloth which has been frozen under the directions of Director of Civil Sup plies in the short interval between the passing of the order and its service on them.\r\nThe second ground was in respect of their individual activities as members of the firm in which they were partners in disposing of stocks of cloth in black market at rates higher than the controlled ones, to various dealers, through agents.\r\nThe particulars were speci fied in Appendix 'A '.\r\nThey refer to the free sale cloth.\r\nIn the third ground it was alleged that ' by illegal means they deprived the rightful claimants of the various stocks of cloth with a view to pass the same into black market at exorbitant rates.\r\nWe do not think it necessary to go into greater details of these grounds or refer to the other grounds.\r\nOn the 9th of July, 1951, petitions under article 226 of the Constitution of India were filed in the East Punjab High Court asking for writs of habeas corpus against the State on the ground that the detention of the appellants under the Preventive Detention Act was illegal.\r\nThe District Magis trate filed his affidavit in reply challenging the allega tion of mala fides and setting out in some detail instances of the activities of the appellants and contended that on the reports received by him he was satisfied that the deten tion of the appellants was necessary.\r\nEarly in August, 1951, the executive authorities cancelled the licence of the appellants as cloth dealers.\r\nThe High Court dismissed the petitions and the petitioners have come on appeal to us.\r\nSection 3 of the , pro vides that the Central Government or the State Government may, if satisfied with respect to any person that 23 with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community it is necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained.\r\nThe power to act in accordance with the terms of this provision was given by section 3 (2) to a District Magistrate.\r\nSuch Magistrate however was required to make a report to the State Govern ment to which he was subordinate about the order and also to send the grounds on which the order had been made and such other particulars as, in his opinion, had a bearing on the necessity of the order.\r\nIt is not disputed that an order under section 3 (2) of the to prevent black marketing can be passed by the District Magistrate.\r\nOn behalf of the appellants it is contended that in the grounds for their detention reference is made to their activities prior to June, 1951, only.\r\nThis cannot be considered objectionable because having regard to those activities it is alleged that the satisfaction required under the section had arisen.\r\nIt was next argued that such loophole as existed in the total control of distribution and ' sale and price of piecegoods in the district was sealed by the order of the District Orga niser dated the 7th June, 1951.\r\nBy virtue of that order the syndicate or corporation could not sell any cloth without an express order in writing from the District Organiser, and therefore there could be no black marketing after that date by any of the appellants and the order was therefore unjus tified.\r\nIt was next contended that in any event now as their licences are cancelled they cannot deal in cloth and the order of detention now maintained against them is more in the nature of punishment than prevention.\r\nIt was argued that orders under the were for the purpose of preventing a person from acting in future in the objectionable way contemplated by the Act and it was beyond the scope of the Act to pass orders in respect of their alleged activities anterior to June, 1951.\r\nIn our opinion the High Court approached the matter quite correctly.\r\nInstances of past activities are relevant 24 to be considered in giving rise to the subjective mental conviction of the District Magistrate that the appellants were likely to indulge in objectionable activities.\r\nThe grounds which were given for the detention are relevant and the question whether they are sufficient or not is not for the decision of the Court.\r\nThe Legislature has made only the subjective satisfaction of the authority making the order essential for passing the order.\r\nThe contention that because in the Amending Act of 1951 an Advisory Board is constitut ed, which can supervise and override the decision taken by the executive authority, and therefore the question whether the grounds are sufficient to give rise to the satisfaction has become a justifiable issue in Court, is clearly unsound.\r\nThe satisfaction for making the initial order is and has always been under the , that of the authority making the order.\r\nBecause the Amending Act of 1951 establishes a supervisory authority, that discretion and subjective test is not taken away and by the establish ment of the Advisory Board, in our opinion, the Court is not given the jurisdiction to decide whether the subjective decision of the authority making the order was right or not.\r\nProceeding on the footing, therefore, that the jurisdiction to decide whether the appellants should be detained under the on the grounds conveyed to the appellants is of the District Magistrate.\r\nIn the present cases, two arguments were advanced on behalf of the appel lants.\r\nIt was strenuously urged that by reason of the order of the District Organiser of the 7th June, 1951, the only loophole which remained in the scheme of distribution and sale of cloth under control of the Government was sealed and it was impossible after that order to do any blackmarketing by any of the appellants.\r\nWe are unable to accept this contention.\r\nIn the first place, this order appears to be an administrative order and is in the nature of a warning.\r\nIt is at variance with the provisions of clause 5 of the Order of the Central Government of the 4th October, 1950.\r\nMoreover this order does not bring about the result claimed for it.\r\nA lot 25 of cloth which the manufacturers are permitted to distribute through persons outside the Government agencies can still be secured and sold at exhorbitant rates, i.e., at rates higher than those fixed by the Government.\r\nThe second argument was that as the licences of the appellants are now cancelled they cannot deal in textile cloth at all and therefore there can be no apprehension of their indulging in black market activities.\r\nWe are unable to accept this argument also because it is common knowledge that licences can be obtained in the name of nominees.\r\nAgain while these people may not have their licences in Jullundur District they may have or may obtain licences in other districts.\r\nFrom the fact that their licences have been cancelled a month after the order of detention was passed we are unable to hold that it is impossible on that ground for the appellants to indulge in black market activities.\r\nIn this connection an extract from the further affidavit of the District Magistrate of Jullun dur dated 1st August, 1951, may be usefully noticed.\r\nHe stated: \"There have been orders for the release of certain stocks of cloth in respect of other mills, as free sale cloth after the 9th June, 1951.\r\nAny quantity of cloth not paid for and lifted by the owners ' nominees will revert to the Mills for free sale: vide letter No. CYC 2\/ SLM, dated the 31st May, 1951, from the Textile Commissioner, Bombay, to all selected Mills in Bombay and Ahmedabad.\r\nThis cloth can be purchased by any wholesale dealer of cloth of India, without any restriction.\r\nNot only this, free sale cloth can be transported from one district to another without a per mit: vide Memo No. 28894 CS (C) 50\/48791, dated 2nd January, 1951, from the Joint Director, Civil Supplies, and Under Secretary to Government Punjab to the District Organiser, Civil Supplies and Rationing, Ludhiana.\r\nAgain free sale cloth is also procurable from individual firms who conspired to make profit by black marketing.\r\nThe only information which is supplied by a purchaser of wholesale cloth to the District Magistrate is as to what quantity of such cloth has been imported 4 26 into the district.\r\nAccording to the report of the District Organiser no such cloth was imported into Jullundur by the corporation but there are reasons to believe that the Corpo ration had been making their purchases in free sale cloth from the Mills and using those bales to make up the defi ciency in the bales of quota cloth of superior quality which they used to dispose of in the black market in collusion with the Mills.\r\nBesides, the firm Rattan Chand Mathra Dass, as would be evident from the attached lists signed by the District Organiser, had been dealing in free sale cloth and had also been importing cloth as Reserve of Kangra and also Provincial Reserve.\r\nMost of this quota also found its way into the black market.\r\nSimilarly the firm Madan Gopal Nand Lall and Company had been dealing in free sale cloth on a large scale.\r\nIt would be evident from the attached list.\r\nSanti Sarup, the Secretary of the Corporation, is believed to be a partner in the firm Hari Chand Bindra Ban and this firm also had been dealing in free sale cloth.\r\nThe free sale cloth acquired by them used to be invariably sold in the black market as reported by the District Organiser in his Memo No. 6306\/6734 M\/CT\/Do.\r\n7 dated 1st August, 1950, in reply to my Memo.\r\nNo. nil dated 30th July, 1951.\r\nThere is absolutely no bar for the wholesale cloth corporation, Jullundur, to its getting free sale cloth from the Mills or other wholesale dealers nor is there any bar for the firms Rattan Chand Mathra Dass and Madan Gopal Nand Lal and Co. to the acquiring of free sale cloth.\r\n\" It was next argued on behalf of the appellants that the only order of detention made against them was the order of the 2nd July and that did not refer to any section of the and did not suggest that there was any satisfaction of the detaining authority.\r\nIt was argued that no order of the 19th of June was ever shown to any of the appellants or served on them and therefore their deten tion was illegal.\r\nIt should be pointed out that these con tentionsare raised in the affidavits not of the detained persons, but of their relations.\r\nTheir affidavits do not show that they have any personal knowledge.\r\nThe affidavits 27 on this point are based only on their belief and information and the source of the information is not even disclosed.\r\nAs against this, there is the affidavit of the District Magis trate which expressly states that the terms of the Order of the 19th of June were fully explained to each of the dete nus.\r\nThe petitions for the writs of habeas corpus were filed within a week after the service of the detention order and we do not think there is any reason to doubt the cor rectness of the statements of the District Magistrate.\r\nIn our opinion this ground of attack on the order of detention has no substance and the detention cannot be held illegal on that ground.\r\nThe judgment of the High Court was attacked on these grounds and as we are unable to accept any of these contentions the appeals must fail.\r\nOne of the appellants is the secretary of one corpora tion and another is a salesman and clerk in one of the firms.\r\nOn their behalf it was urged that they could not indulge in black market activities.\r\nWe are unable to accept this contention in view of what is stated in the affidavits of the District Magistrate.\r\nIt is there pointed out that in addition to being a secretary or a clerk and in those capac ities actively participating in the black market activities of their principals, they were themselves indulging in black market activities in cloth.\r\nIf these and other facts in respect of the appellants are disputed the matter will be considered by the Advisory Board.\r\nThe question of the truth of those statements however is not within the jurisdiction of this Court to decide.\r\nAs all the grounds urged against the judgment of the High Court fail, all the five appeals are dismissed.\r\nAppeals dismissed.\r\nAgent for the appellants in all the appeals: R.S. Naru la.\r\nAgent for the respondent and Intervener: P.A. Mehta.",

No. 344 and S.T.R. No. 347 of 1967.\r\n745 N. D. Karkhanis and 0.\r\nP. Rana, for the appellant.\r\nNo. appearance, for the respondent.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA, J.\r\nThe common question of law for determination in these appeals by special leave is ': Whether section 14(2) of the Limitation Act, in terms, or, in principle, can be invoked for excluding the time spent in prosecuting an application under Rule 68(6) of the J.P. Sales Tax Rules for setting aside the order of dismissal of appeal in default, under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 (for short, the Sales= Act), from computation of the period of limitation for filing a revision under that Act? It arises out of these circumstances.\r\nThe respondent, M\/s. Parson Tools and Plants (hereinafter referred to as the assesse) carries on business at Kanpur.\r\nThe Sales tax Officer assessed tax for the assessment years, 1958 1959 and 1959 60, on the, assessee by two separate orders.\r\nThe assessee filed appeals against those orders before the Appellate Authority.\r\nOn May 10, 1963, when the appeals came up for hearing, the assessee was absent.\r\nThe appeals were, therefore, dismissed in default by virtue of Rule 68(5) of the U.P. Sales tax Rules.\r\nSub rule (6) of Rules 68 provided for setting aside such dismissal and re admission of the appeal.\r\nOn the same day (May 10, 1963), the assessee made two applications in accordance with Sub rule (6) for setting aside the dismissal.\r\nDuring the pendency of those applications, Sub rule (5) of Rule 68 was declared ultra vires the rule making authority by Manchanda J. of the High Court who further held that the Appellate Authority could not dismiss an appeal in default but was bound to decide it on merits even though the appellant be absent.\r\nWhen these, applications under Rule 68(6) came up for hearing, on 20 10 1964, the Appellate Authority dismissed them outright in view of the ruling of Manchanda J. Against the order of dismissal of his appeals, the assessee on 16 12 1964 filed two revision petitions under section 10 of the Sales tax Act,, before the Revisional Authority (Judge (Revisions) Sales tax).\r\nThese revision petitions having been filed more than 18 months after the dismissal of the appeals, which was the maximum, period of limitation prescribed by sub . 73) of s 10 were prima facie time barred.\r\nThey were however, accompanied by two applications in which the assessee prayed for exclusion of the time spent by him in prosecuting the abortive proceedings under Rule 68(6) for setting aside the dismissal of his appeals.\r\nThe Revisional Authority found that the assessee had been pursuing his remedy under Rule 68(6) with due diligence and in good faith.\r\nIt therefore excluded the time spent in those proceedings from computation of limitation by applying section 14, Limitation Act and in consequence, held that the revision petitions were within time.\r\nOn the motion of the Commissioner of Sales tax, the Revisional Authority made two references under section 11 (I) of the Sales tax Act to the High Court for answering the following question of law : \"Whether under the circumstances of the case, section 14 of the Limitation Act extended the period for filing 746 of the revisions by the time during which the restoration applications remained pending as being prosecuted bona fide.\r\n\" The references were heard by a Full Bench of three learned Judges, each of whom wrote a separate Judgment.\r\nDwivedi J. with whom Singh J. agreed after reframing the question held \"that the time spent in prosecuting the application for setting aside the order of dismissal of appeals in default can be excluded from computing the period of limitation for filing the revision by the application of the principle underlying section 14(2).\r\nLimitation Act.\r\n\" Hari Swarup J. was of the opinion: \"The Judge (Revisions) Sales tax while hearing the revisions under section 10 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act does not act as a Court but only as a revenue tribunal and hence the provisions of the Indian Limitation Act cannot apply to proceedings before him.\r\nIf the Limitation Act does not apply then neither section 29(2) nor section 14(2) of the Limitation Act will apply to proceedings before him.\r\n,\" The learned Judge was further of the view that the principle of section 14(2) also, could not be invoked to extend the time beyond the maximum fixed by the Legislature in sub section (3 B) of section 10 of the Sales tax Act.\r\nSub section (2) of section 14, Limitation Act, runs thus \"In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceedings, whether in a Court of first instance or of.\r\nappeal or revision, against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it.\" (emphasis added).\r\nIf will be seen that this sub section will apply only if (1) both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party; (2) the proceedings had been prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith; (3) the failure of the prior proceedings was due to a defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature; (4) both the proceedings are proceedings in a Court.\r\nMr. Karkhanis, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant does not dispute the view taken by the High Court that the Proceedings in question under the Sales tax Act could be deemed as civil proceeding.\r\nLearned Counsel, however, contends that the authorities, irrespective of whether they exercise, original, appellate or revisional 747 jurisdiction under the Sales tax Act are not 'Courts ' within the ' contemplation of section 14(2) of the Limitation Act.\r\nIt is pointed out that his question stands concluded by this Court 's decision in Jagannath Prasad vs State of U.P.(1) Mr. Karkhanis is right that this matter is no longer res Integra.\r\nIn Shrimti Ujjam Bhai vs State of U.P.(2) Hidayatullah J. (as he hen was) speaking for the Court, observed : \"The taxing authorities are instrumentalities of the State,.\r\nThey are not a part of the legislature, nor are they a part of the judiciary.\r\nTheir functions are the assessment and collection of taxes and in the process of assessing taxes, they follow a pattern of action which is considered Judicial.\r\nThey are not thereby converted into Courts of Civil judicature.\r\nThey will remain the instrumentalities of the State and are within the definition of \"State\" in Article 12.\r\n\" The above observations were quoted with approval by this Court Jagannath Prasad 's case (supra), and it was held that a Sales tax officer under U.P. Sales tax Act, 1948 was not a Court within the meaning of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure although he is required to perform certain quasi judicial functions.\r\nThe decision in jaganath Prasad 's it seems, *as not brought to the notice of he High Court.\r\nIn view of these pronocements of this Court, here is no room for argument that the Appellent Authority and the judge (Revisions) Sales tax exercising jurisdiction under the Salestax Act, are courts.\r\n\" They are merely administrative Tribunals and not courts.\" Section 14, Limitation Act, therefore does not, in terms apply to proceedings before such Tribunals.\r\nFurther question that remains is : Is the general principle underlying section 14 (2) applicable on grounds of Justice, equity and good conscience for excluding the time spent in prosecuting the abortive applications under Rule 68 (6) before the Appellate Authority., for computing limitation for the purpose of revision applications.\r\nMr. Karkhanis maintains that the answer to this question, also, must be in the negative because definite indications are available in the scheme and language of the Sales tax Act, which exclude the application of section 14(2), Limitation Act even in principle or by or by analogy.\r\nLearned Counsel further submits that the ratio of the Privy Council decision in Ramdute Ramkissen Dass vs E. D. Sesson & Co.(s) relied upon by the majority judgment of the High is not applicable for computing limitation prescribed under the Sales tax Act.\r\nReference in this connection has been made to Purshottam Dass Hassaram vs Impex (India) Lid.(4) wherein a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court explained the rule of decision in Ramdutt 's case (supra) and found it to be inapplicable for the purpose of computing limitation for ap plications under the .\r\n(1) ; (2) [1963] 1, S.C.R. 778.\r\n(3) AlR , (4) A.I.R. 1954 Bom, 309 748 The material pail of s.10 runs thus : \"(3) (i).\r\nThe Revision Authority. . may, for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any order made by any appellate or assessing authority under this Act, in its discretion call for and examine, either on its own motion or on the application of the Commissioner of gales tax or the person aggrieved, the record of such order and pass such order as it may think fit.\r\n* * * * * * (3A). . (3B) The application under sub section (3) shall be made within one year from the date of service of the order complained of, but the Revising Authority may on proof of sufficient cause entertain an application within a further period of six months.\r\n\" Three features of the scheme of the above provision are noteworthy.\r\nThe first is that no limitation has been prescribed for the suo motu exercise of its jurisdiction by the Revising Authority.\r\nThe second is that the period of one year prescribed as, limitation for filing an application for revision by the aggrieved party is unusually long.\r\nThe third is that the Revising Authority has no discretion to extend this period beyond a further period of six months, even on sufficient cause shown.\r\nAs rightly pointed out in the minority judgment of the High Court, pendency of proceedings of the nature contemplated by section 14(2) of the Limitation Act, may amount to a sufficient cause for condoning the delay and extending the limitation for filing a revision application, but section 10 (3 B) of the Sales tax Act, gives no jurisdiction to the Revising Authority to extend the limitation, even in such a case, for a further period of more than six months.\r\nThe three star features of the scheme and language of the above provision, unmistakably show that the legislature has deliberately excluded the application of the principles underlying sections 5 and.\r\n14 of the Limitation Act, except to the extent and in the truncated form embodied in sub section\r\n(3 13) of section 10 of the Sales tax Act.\r\nDelay in disposal of revenue matters adversely affects the steady inflow of reve nues and the financial stability of the State.\r\nSection 10 is therefore designed to, ensure speedy and final determination of fiscal matters within a reasonably certain time schedule.\r\nIt cannot be said that by excluding the unrestricted application of the principles of sections 5 and 14 of the Limitation Act, the Legislature has made.\r\nthe provisions of section 10, unduly oppressive.\r\nIn most cases, the discretion to extend limitation, on sufficient cause being shown for a further period of six months only, given by sub section\r\n( 3_B) would be enough to afford relief.\r\nCases are no doubt conceivable where an aggrieved party, despite sufficient cause, is unable to make an 749 application for revision within this maximum period of 18 months.\r\nSuch harsh cases would be rare.\r\nEven, in such exceptional cases of extreme hardship, the Revising Authoritly may, on its own motion, entertain revision and grant relief.\r\nBe that as it may, from the scheme and language of section 1 0, the intention of the Legislature to exclude the unrestricted application of the principles of sections 5 and 10 of the Limitation Act is manifestly clear.\r\nThese provisions of the Limitation Act which the Legislature did not, after due application of mind, incorporate in the Sales tax Act, cannot be imported into it by analogy.\r\nAn enactment being the will of the legislature, the paramount rule of interpretation, which overrides all others, is that a statute is to be expounded \"according to the intent of them that made it\".\r\n\"The will of 'the legislature is the supreme law of the land, and demands perfect obdience\".(1) \"Judicial power is never exercised\" said Marshall C. J. of the United States, \"for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the Judges; always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the Legislature; or in other words, to the will of the law\".\r\nIf the legislature wilfully omits to incorporate something of an 'analogous law in a subsequent statute, or even if there is a casus omissus in a statute, the language of which is otherwise plain and unambiguous, the Court is not competent to supply the omission by engrafting on it or introducing in it, under the guise of interpretation, by analogy or implication, something what it thinks to be a general principle of justice and equity.\r\nTo do so would be entrenching upon the preserves of Legislatures, 'The primary function of a court of law being jus dicere and not jus dare. ' In the light of what has been said above, we are of the opinion that the High Court was in error in importing whole hog the principle of section 14(2) of the Limitation Act into section 10 (3 B) of the Sales tax Act.\r\nThe ratio of the Privy Council decision in Ramdutt Ramkissen Dass vs E. D. Sasson & Co. (Supra) relied upon by the High Court is not on speaking terms with the clear language of section 10 (3 B) of the Sales tax Act.\r\nThat decision was rendered long before the passage of the Indian .\r\nIt lost its efficacy after the enactment of the which contained a specific provision in regard to exclusion of time from computation of limitation.\r\nThe case in point is Purshottam Dass Hussaram vs Index (India) Ltd. (supra).\r\nIn this Bombay case, the question was, whether the suit was barred by limitation.\r\nIt was not disputed that Article 115 of the Limitation Act governed the limitation and if no other factor was to be taken into consideration, the suit was filed beyond time.\r\nBut what was relied upon by the plaintiff for the purpose of saving (i) see Maxwell on interpretation of statutes, 11th Edn.,pp.l, 2 and 25l, 750 limitation was the fact that there were certain infructuous arbitration,, Proceedings and if the time taken in prosecuting those proceedings was eXcluded under section 14, the suit would be within limitation.\r\nIt was held that if section 14 were to be construed strictly, the plaintiff would not be entitled to exclude the period in question.\r\nOn the authority of Ramdutt Ramkissen 's case (supra), it was then contended that.\r\nthe time taken in arbitration proceedings should be excluded on the analogy of section 14.\r\nThis contention was also negatived on the ground that since the decision of the Privy Council, the legislature had in section 37(5) of the , provided as to what extent the provisions of the Limitation Act would be applicable to the proceedings before the arbitrator.\r\nSection 37(5) was as follows : \"Where the cow orders that an award be set aside or orders, after the commencement of an arbitration, that the arbitration agreement shall cease to have effect with respect to the difference referred, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order of the Court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, for the commencement of the proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the difference referred.\r\n\" The reasons advanced, the observations made and the rule enunciated by Chagla C.J., who spoke for the Bench in that case, are opposite and may be extracted with advantage \". . we have now a statutory provision for exclusion of time taken up in arbitration Pr when a suit Is filed, and the question arises of computing the period of limitation with regard to that suit, and the time that has got to be excluded is only that time which is taken up as provided in section 37(5).\r\nThere must be an order of the Court setting aside an award or there must be an order of the Court declaring that the arbitration agreement shall cease to have effect, and the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of this order is the period that has got to be excluded.\r\nit is therefore no longer open to the Court to rely on section 14 Limitation Act as applying by analogy to arbitration proceedings.\r\nIf the Legislature intended that section 14 should apply and.\r\nthat all the time taken up in arbitration proceedings should be excluded, then there was no reason to enact section 37(5).\r\n, The very fact that section 37(5) has been enacted clearly shows that the whole period referred to in. a, 49 Limitation Act is not to be excluded but the limited '. indicated in section 37(5).\r\n* * * * * * 751 \"it may seem rather curious and it may also in certain cases result in hardship as to why the legislature should not have excluded all time taken up in good faith before an arbitrator just as the time taken up in prosecuting a suit or an appeal in good faith is excluded.\r\nBut obviously the Legislature did no t intend that parties should waste time infructuous proceedings before arbitrators.\r\nThe Iegisla ture has clearly indicated that limitation having once begun to run, no time could be excluded merely because parties chose to go before an arbitrator without getting an award or without coming to Court to get the necessary order indicated in section 37(5).\r\n\" What the learned Chief Justice said about the inapplicability of section 14, Limitation Act, in the context of section 37(5) of the , holds good with added force with reference to section 10 (3 B) of the Sales tax Act.\r\nThus the principle that emerges is that if the legislature in a special statute prescribes a certain period of limitation for filing a particular application thereunder and provides in clear terms that such period on sufficient cause being shown, may be extended, in the maximum, only upto a specified time limit and no further, than the tribunal concerned has no jurisdiction to treat within limitation, an application filed before it beyond such maximum time limk specified in the statute, by excluding the time spent in prosecuting in good faith and due diligence any prior proceeding on the analogy of section 14(2) of the Limitation Act.\r\nWe have said enough and we may say it again that where the legislature clearly declares its intent in the scheme and language of a statute, it is the duty of the court to give full effect to the same without scanning its wisdom or policy, and without engrafting, adding or implying anything which is not congenial to or consistent with such expressed intent of the law giver; more so if the statute is a taxing statute.\r\nWe will close the discussion by recalling what Lord Hailsham (1) has said recently, in regard to importation of the principles of natural justice into a statute which is a clear and complete Code, by itself : \"It is true of course that the courts will lean heavily ,against any construction of a statute which would be manifestly fair.\r\nBut they have no power to amend or supplement the language of a statute merely because in one view (1)At P. 11 in Pearl Berg vs Varty , 752 of the matter a subject feels himself entitled to a larger degree of say in the making of a decision than a statute accords him.\r\nStill less is it the functioning of the courts to form first a judgment on the fairness of an Act of Parliament and theft to amend or supplement it with new provisions so as to make it conform to that judgment.\r\n\" For all the reasons aforesaid, we are of the opinion that the object, the scheme and language of s.10 of the Sales tax Act do not permit the invocation of s.14(2) of the Limitation Act, either, in terms, or, in principle, for excluding the time spent in prosecuting proceedings for setting aside the dismissal of appeals in default, from com putation of the period of limitation prescribed for filing a revision under the Sales tax.\r\nAccordingly, we answer the question referred, in the negative.\r\nIn the result, we set aside the judgment of the High Court and accept these appeals.\r\nSince the appeals have been heard ex parte, there will be no order as to costs.",

Agarwal, J.N. Hazarika and K.P. Gupta, for the appellants.\r\nSankar Bannerjee, P.K. Chatterjee, D.N. Gupta and B.N.Ghosh, for the respondents.\r\nNovember 25, 1963.\r\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.\r\nThis appeal by special leave arises from an industrial dispute between the respondent, the Management of 11 Tea Estates and the appellants, their workmen.\r\nIt appears that the appellants raised a dispute against the respondent in regard to the lay off declared by them in the 11 550 estates in question in February, 1959.\r\nThe said (ay off lasted for 45 days and the appellants ' contention was that the lay off was not justified, and so, they were entitled to their full wages for the period of the lay off.\r\nThe respondent 's Managing Agents for the nine Companies that run the 11 tea estates in question, resisted this claim on the ground that the lay off was justified and they alleged that the appellants were not entitled to anything more than the compensation prescribed by section 25C of the (hereinafter called 'the Act ').\r\nThis dispute was referred to the adjudication of the Industrial Tribunal by the Governor of Assam under section 10(1)(d) of the Act.\r\nThe 11 tea estates which are concerned with this dispute were described in Appendix A to the order of reference.\r\nIt is common ground that these 11 tea estates ' are run by nine Companies and M\/s. Macneill and Barry Ltd. are the Managing Agents of all these companies.\r\nThe case for the respondent was that the tea estates in question which are all situated in Cachar District had to face a long period of depression in trade by reason of the poor prices generally commanded by the tea produced by them.\r\nIn 1959, the management faced a very difficult financial position and it took the view that in the interests of the employees and its own business, it would be appropriate to lay off the workmen for a certain period in order to avoid closure of business.\r\nThe circumstances which caused financial depression were beyond the control of the management and lay off was, therefore, inevitable and fully justified.\r\nOn the other hand, the appellants urged that there were other tea estates in the district of Cachar which had to face similar problems; the labour costs incurred by the respondent were not higher than the corresponding costs incurred by the other tea estates, the burden of taxes was the same for all the tea estates in the district and the quality of the tea produced was relatively similar.\r\nThey contended that the difficulty which the respondent had to face 551 was partly the result of its mismanagement and neglect.\r\nThey pleaded that the workmen employed by the respondent had been promised continuous work throughout the year and the declaration of lay off for such a long period as 45 days exposed them to the risk of semi starvation.\r\nThe appellants also urged that depression in trade or financial difficulties which may be characterised as trade reasons did not justify the lay off under the relevant Standing Order, and so, they justified their claim for full wages during the period of the lay off.\r\nThe Tribunal has held that the relevant Standing Order No. 8 justified the lay off.\r\nThe trade reasons resulting from the depression in trade and financial liabilities arising therefrom fell within the scope of the Standing Order; it has also held that the last clause in the Standing Order which was general in terms could be relied upon by the respondent in support of its plea that the lay off was justified.\r\nIn the alternative, the Tribunal thought that even if the lay off was not justified by the relevant clause in the Standing Order, the respondent had a common law right to declare a lay off and this right was recognised by section 25C of the Act.\r\nAccording to the Tribunal, section 25 C recognises this common law right and since it is a statutory provision, it over rides the relevant clause in the standing Order.\r\nHaving thus found that the lay off was justified, the Tribunal proceeded to examine the question as to whether the trade reasons on which the respondent relied had 'been proved.\r\nIt then considered the relevant documentary evidence bearing on the point and noticed some general features applicable to all the tea companies before it.\r\n\"They have suffered losses which are by no means inconsiderable\", said the Tribunal, \"and some of the companies have not been able to declare dividends in time during the last ten years, though others have declared them from year to year.\r\n\" The Tribunal rejected the respondent 's contention that the losses were due to high labour charges, but it found that the tea companies were not making adequate profits.\r\nIt was satisfied that 552 the companies had reserves and large capital assets and would not have found it difficult to raise necessary finances.\r\nOn the whole, the Tribunal thought it necessary to distinguish between the different tea estates with which it was dealing, and having considered their respective individual cases, it came to the conclusion that out of the nine companies, five companies need not have declared lay off for 45 days.\r\nIn its opinion, there was justification for lay off in their cases, but its duration should have been 21 days.\r\nActing on this finding, the Tribunal has ordered that for the 24 days in excess of three weeks for which the lay off was justified the said companies should pay their workmen full wages and not merely the compensation prescribed by section 25C of the Act.\r\nIn regard to the remaining four companies, the Tribunal held that the lay off was fully justified, and so, the workmen were not entitled to full wages for the period of the lay off.\r\nIn other words, the award made by the Tribunal partially granted relief to the appellants inasmuch as it gave them full wages against five companies for 24 days only.\r\nThese five companies are: Bhubandhar, Doyapore, Western Cachar, Borak and Koyah.\r\nThe other four companies in respect of which the Tribunal has given no relief to the workmen are: Doodputlee ' Majagram, Scottpore and Tarrapore.\r\nIt is this award which has given rise to the present appeal by the appellants.\r\nThe first question which arises for our decision is whether the Tribunal was justified in holding that section 25C recognises the common law right of the respondent to declare a lay off for reasons other than those specified in the relevant clause of the Standing Order.\r\nWhile dealing with this argument, we must proceed on the assumption that the financial difficulties experienced by the respondent at the relevant time which have been compendiously described by it as constituting trading reasons for the lay off do not fall within the purview of the said relevant clause.\r\nThe respondent 's argument is that though the trading reasons may not justify the declaration of the lay off 553 under the said clause, as prudent employers who must be given liberty to run their industry in the best manner they choose, they have a common law right to declare a lay off if they feel that the alternative to the lay, off would be closure and acting bonafide they want to avoid closure and adopt the lesser evil,, of declaring the lay off.\r\nDoes section 25C of the, Act justify this argument? Section 25C(1) which, recognises the right of the workmen who are laid; off, for compensation, provides that whenever a workman therein specified has been laid off, he shall be paid by the employer for whole of the period of the lay off, except for such weekly holidays as may intervene, compensation at the rate prescribed by the section.\r\nThe proviso to this section lays down that the compensation payable to a workman during any period of twelve months shall not be for more than; 45 days; and this proviso seems to indicate that the legislature thought that normally the period of lay off within 12 months may not exceed 45 days.\r\nSection 25C(2), however, contemplates the possibility that the period of lay off may exceed 45 days, and it lays down that if during any period of 12 months, a work , man is laid off for more than 45 days, whether continuously or intermittently, he shall be paid compensation in the manner indicated by it.\r\nThus, the position is that workmen who are laid off are entitled to compensation and the method in which the said compensation has to be calculated has been prescribed by the two clauses of section 25C.\r\nIt is, however, significant that when section 25C deals with workmen who are laid off and proceeds to prescribe the manner in which compensation should be paid to them, it is inevitably referring to the lay off as defined by section 2(kkk) of the Act.\r\nThe said section defines a \"lay off\" (with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions) as meaning: \"the failure, refusal, or inability of an employer on account of shortage of coal, power or raw materials or the accumulation of stocks or the breakdown of machinery or for any other reason 554 to give employment to a workman whose name is borne on the muster rolls of his industrial establishment and who has not been retrench ed.\r\n\" It would be legitimate to hold that lay off which primarily gives rise to a claim for compensation under section 25C must be a lay off as defined by section 2(kkk) If the relevant clauses in the Standing Orders of industrial employers make provisions for lay off and also prescribe the manner in which compensation should be paid to them for such lay off, perhaps the matter may be covered by the said relevant clauses; but if the relevant clause merely provides for circumstances under which lay off may be declared by the employer and a question arises as to how compensation has to be paid to the workmen thus laid off, section 25C can be invoked by workmen provided, of course, the lay off permitted by the Standing Order also satisfies the requirements of section 2(kkk).\r\nWhether or not section 25C can be invoked by workmen who are laid off for reasons authorised by the relevant clause of the Standing Order applicable to them when such reasons do not fall under section 2(kkk), is a matter with which we are not directly concerned in the present appeal.\r\nThe question which we are concerned with at this stage is whether it can be said that section 25C recognises a common law right of the industrial employer to lay off his workmen.\r\nThis question must, in our opinion, be answered in the negative.\r\nWhen the laying off of the workmen is referred to in section 25C, it is the laying off as defined by section 2(kkk), and so, workmen who can claim the benefit of section 25C must be workmen who are laid off and laid off for reasons contemplated by section 2(kkk); that is all that section 25C means.\r\nIf any case is not covered by the Standing Orders, it will necessarily be governed by the provisions of the Act, and lay off would be permissible only where one or the other of the factors mentioned by section 2(kkk) is present, and for such lay off compensation would be awarded under section 25C.\r\nTherefore, we do not think that the Tribunal was right in holding that section 25C recognises the inherent right 555 of the employer to declare lay off for reasons which he may regard as sufficient or satisfactory in that behalf.\r\nNo such common law right can be spelt out from the provisions of section 25C.\r\nThat takes us to the question whether the lay off in the present case is justified under Rule 8 of the, Standing Orders which have been duly certified under ' the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, (No. 20 of 1946).\r\nThe relevant portion of Rule 8 reads thus: \"Closing and re opening of sections of the in dustrial establishments, and temporary stoppages of work, and the rights and liabilities of the employer and workmen arising therefrom.\r\n(a) (1) The Manager may at any time in the event of fire, catastrophe, break down of machinery, stoppage of power or supply, epidemic, civil commotion, strike, extreme climate conditions or other causes beyond his control, close down either the factory or field work or both without notice.\r\nIn cases where workmen are laid off for short periods on account of failure of plant or a temporary curtailment of production, the period of unemployment shall be treated as compulsory leave either with or without pay, as the case may be, when, however, workmen have to be laid off for an indefinitely long period, their services may be terminated after giving them due notice or pay in lieu thereof.\r\n\" It will be seen that the circumstances under which a lay off can be declared have been specifically described by Rule 8(a)(1).\r\nTwo grounds have been urged before us by Mr. Banerjee in support of the Tribunal 's conclusion that the impugned lay off is justified.\r\nHe contends that the clause \"stoppage of supply\" may cover cases of stoppage of financial assistance.\r\nThe argument is that in 1959 when the lay off was declared.\r\nthe companies found that they 556 could not raise enough money to carry on the operations in the tea gardens, and so, it was a case of stoppage of supply.\r\nIf that be so, the lay off would be justified.\r\nIn our opinion, this argument is wholly misconceived.\r\nStoppage of supply must, in the context, mean stoppage of raw material or other such thing.\r\nIn regard to the factory, the stoppage of supply may mean the stoppage of tea leaves, or in the case of field work, it may mean the stoppage of supply of other articles necessary for field operations.\r\nIt is impossible to accept the argument that \"supply\" in the context can mean money or funds.\r\nThe other argument urged before us is that the last clause of R. 8(a)(i) which refers to \"other causes beyond his control\" would take in the financial difficulties of the Cos.\r\nWe are not inclined to accept this argument also.\r\nOther causes beyond his control for one thing should be similar to the causes that have preceded; even otherwise we see no justification for the argument that the financial difficulty which is alleged to have confronted the respondent was beyond its control.\r\nIn fact, on this point the Tribunal has made a definite finding that though the respondent had produced a letter from the Chartered Bank of the 9th April, 1959 in which the Bank expressed its re luctance to afford financial facilities, it was by no means clear that the Companies acting through their Managing Agents completely failed to raise the necessary finances at the relevant time.\r\nAs the Tribunal has observed, the letter written by the Bank shows that it had promised to consider the matter and write to the Companies again; no evidence was produced to show what the Bank subsequently stated and whether finances became available or not ' On the other hand, it is clear that at the end of the period of the lay off, all the Cos. started operating their tea gardens and we have been told that the operations have continued uninterrupted ever since.\r\nBesides, the letter on which reliance is placed was written in April, 1959, whereas the lay off was declared in February, 1959.\r\nTherefore, there is no evidence on the record which can justify 557 the assumption made by Mr. Banerjee when he raised the contention that the financial difficulties faced by the respondent at the relevant time were beyond its control.\r\nThe fact that some of the Cos. have been incurring losses and have not made profits would not necessarily show that the financial position which they had to face at the relevant time was beyond their control.\r\nIt is true, as Mr. Banerjee has pointed out, that the three Cos. Scottpore, Tarrapore and Doodputalee have not been able to pay dividends between 1951 to 1958 and it may be that with the exception of the year 1954, the position of all of them is not very satisfactory; but, on the other hand, there are other tea gardens in the same area and it is not suggested or shown that their position was any better than that of the companies before us.\r\nIt is also true that at the relevant time, all the tea companies in Cachar in general, and the Managing Agents of the nine companies before us in particular M\/s. Macneill and Barry Ltd. were trying their best to persuade the Assam Government to give them some relief in the matter of taxation.\r\nBut the question which we have to decide is whether the financial position disclosed by the evidence on the record can be described as constitu ting a cause beyond the control of the respondent.\r\nWe are not inclined to answer this question in favour of the respondent.\r\nBesides, as we have already indicated, having regard to the factors specified by Rule 8(a)(i) before the clause in regard to other causes beyond his control was introduced, it would not be easy to entertain the argument that a trading reason of the kind suggested by Mr. Banerjee can be included in that clause.\r\nTherefore, we are satisfied that the Tribunal was in error in holding that the impugned lay off could be justified by Rule 8(a)(i).\r\nRule 8(a) (iii) which refers to temporary curtailment of production must obviously be read in the light of R. 8(a)(1) and if the case of the present lay off does not fall under R. 8 (a)(i), R. 8(a) (iii) would not improve the position.\r\nMr. Banerjee has then urged that the present Standing Orders which were duly certified under the 558 Standing Orders Act came into force in 1950, whereas section 2(kkk) which defines a lay off was added to the Act by the Amending Act 43 of 1953 on the 24 th October, 1953.\r\nHis argument is that the Standing Orders having been certified before the definition of the lay off was introduced in the Act, the respondent is entitled to rely upon the said definition in support r of the plea that the impugned lay off was justified.\r\nBasing himself on the definition of the lay off as prescribed by section 2(kkk), Mr. Banerjee urged that this definition was wider than R. 8(a)(1) of the respondent 's Standing Orders and would take in the trading reasons on which he relies.\r\nWe are not prepared to accept the argument that in the present case, the respondent can rely on the definition of lay off as prescribed by section 2(kkk).\r\nIt will be recalled that the Standing Orders which have been certified under the Standing Orders Act became part of the statutory terms and conditions of service between the industrial employer and his employees.\r\nSection 10(1) of the Standing Orders Act provides that the Standing Orders finally certified under this Act shall not, except on agreement between the employer and the workmen, be liable to modification until the expiry of six months from the date on which the Standing Orders or the last modification thereof came into operation.\r\nIf the Standing Orders thus become the part of the statutory terms and conditions of service, they will govern the relations between the parties unless, of course, it can be shown that any provision of the Act is inconsistent with the said Standing Orders.\r\nIn that case, it may be permissible to urge that the statutory provision contained in the Act should over ride the Standing Order which had been certified before the said statutory provision was enacted.\r\nAssuming without deciding that section 2(kkk) may include the trading reasons as suggested by Mr. Banerjee, the definition prescribed by section 2(kkk) is not a part of the operative provisions of the Act, and so, the argument that there is inconsistency between the definition and the relevant Rule of the Standing Orders does not assist Mr. Banerjee 's case.\r\nIf there had been a provision in the Act specifically providing 559 that an employer would be entitled to lay off his workmen for the reasons prescribed by section 2(kkk), it might have been another matter.\r\nThe only provision on which reliance has been placed is contained in section 25C and that, as we have already seen, merely takes in the definition of lay off inasmuch as it refers to the workmen as laid off and provides the manner in which compensation would be paid to them.\r\nAn alleged conflict between the definition of lay off and the substantive rule of the Standing Orders would not, therefore, help the respondent to contend that the definition over rides the statutory conditions as to lay off included in the certified Standing Order.\r\nTherefore, we do not think Mr. Banerjee would be entitled to contend that section 2(kkk) of the Act is wider than the relevant Rule in the Standing Orders and should apply to the facts of this case.\r\nWe ought to make it clear that in dealing with this argument, we have not thought it necessary to consider whether the broad and general construction of section 2(kkk) for which Mr. Banerjee contends is justified.\r\nIn fact, Mr. Agarwala for the appellants has very strongly urged that the words \"for any reason\" found in section 2(kkk) will not take in the trading considerations.\r\nHe contends and prima facie with some force that the said words must be construed ejusdem generis with the words that precede them.\r\n(vide Management of Kairbetta Estate, Kotagiri vs Rajamanickam & Ors.)(1) According to him, the circumstances specified in section 2(kkk) which justify a lay off must be integrally connected with production, and so, trading reasons cannot be included in that definition.\r\nAccording to this argument, the distinguishing features of the genus of which the several circumstances mentioned in the definition are different species, are: they are beyond the control of the employer, are expected to be of a short duration, and are of compulsive effect.\r\nAs we have already indicated, we do not think it necessary to decide this interesting point in the present appeal because we are satisfied that the present dis (1) ; 560 pute must be governed by Rule 8(a)(1) of the respondent 's Standing Orders.\r\nIn the result, we reverse the finding of the Tribunal that the lay off declared by the respondent for 45 days in 1959 was justified.\r\nThat being so, it is unnecessary to consider the individual cases of the nine respective companies, because whatever may have been their respective financial position, under the relevant Rule they could not validly declare a lay off at all, nor could they have declared the lay off in exercise of their alleged common law right.\r\nThe questions referred to the Tribunal must, therefore, be answered in favour of the appellants.\r\nThe appeal is accordingly allowed and the appellants ' claim for full wages for the 45 days of lay off in respect of the 11 tea gardens is awarded to them.\r\nThe appellants will be entitled to their costs throughout.\r\nAppeal allowed.",

Hathi, P.C. Kupur, R.S. Mehta, O.P. Verma and S.N. Singh for the Respondents.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court Was delivered by DESAI, J.\r\nThese two appeals by special leave arise from two Suits filed by Barkatullah and Sahfiullah for possession of land more 929 particularly set out at the foot of the plaint against the Zamindars and Prem Kumari and Noor Mohammad.\r\nBriefly stated the plaintiffs ' A case was that they were Thekadars and the Theka was taken for personally cultivating the land and therefore under sec.\r\n12 of the U P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 ( '1950 Act ' for short), they have become hereditary tenants and they were in possession of land on Ist April 1960.\r\nIt was alleged that the Zamindars had no right to lease the land after the plaintiffs became hereditary tenants yet Prem Kumari and Noor Mohammad took land on lease from Zamindars and entered possession after 1.4 1950.\r\nIt was alleged that the lessees from the Zamindar had no right to remain in possession as against hereditary tenants.\r\nOn this short ground the plaintiffs sought possession of the land.\r\nThe defendants were the Zamindars and two lessees contested the suit.\r\nThe averments made in para 4 of the plaint were not controverted specifically and it was merely stated that they are subject to additional pleas.\r\nThe only plea put forward on behalf of the lessees worth noticing is that the lessees were in cultivatory possession during the year 1359 F and being not a person who has become a bhumidar sirdar, Adhivasi or Asami is entitled to all the rights of Adhivasis under U.P. Land Reforms (Supplementary) Act, 1952 ( '1952 Act ' for short) The trial court dismissed the suit observing that the plaintiffs were Thekadars of the land and under sec.\r\n12 of the 1950 Act have acquired rights of hereditary tenants but the lessees were in cultivatory possession in 1359 F and therefore have acquired the right of adhivasi.\r\nThekanama was held to be defective on the question of Theka being given exclusively for personal cultivation.\r\nThe two plaintiffs preferred two separate appeals and both the appeals were disposed of by the First Additional Civil and Sessions Judge, Gonda as per his judgment dated September 1, 1958.\r\nBroadly stated, the learned Judge agreed with the findings of the trial court and dismissed the appeals.\r\nThe original plaintiffs carried the matter in .\r\nsecond appeal.\r\nTwo separate appeals were preferred, by the time the appeals came up for hearing, a statement was made that both the plaintiffs have compromised the dispute inter Se and that the suit be treated as one and if the appeal is to be allowed, possession is to be given jointly to two appellants as against the respondents H The learned Judge disposed of both the appeals by common judgment reversing the decision of the trial court and the first 930 appellate court holding that the plaintiffs had acquired the status of A hereditary tenants and were in possession on 1.5.1950 and, therefore, the Zamindars had no right to dispossess the plaintiffs and induct the two lessees in possession.\r\nIt was further held that as the lessees came into possession under Zamindars who had no right to grant the lease possession of the lessees being thus unlawful against the plaintiffs, they could not have acquired the Adivasis rights.\r\nAccordingly, the suit was decreed and a decree for possession was granted in favour of the plaintiffs.\r\nHence these two appeals by special leave Both the original lessees have died and their heirs and legal representative are prosecuting these appeals.\r\nMr. Rangarajan, learned counsel for the appellants urged that in view of the finding of the trial court that there was no specific authority given to the Thekadars for personal cultivation of the lands comprised in the Theka, the Thekadars plaintiffs did not acquire the right of hereditary tenants under sec 12 of the 1950 Act.\r\nThis was the principal contention urged in these two appeals.\r\n1950 Act was a measure of agrarian reform enacted with a view to abolishing the Zamindari system and for acquisition of intermediaries ' rights.\r\nSection 4 provided for vesting of estates in the State free from all encumbrances with effect from the date to be specified by the State Government in a notification.\r\nSec. 6, inter alia, provided the consequences of the vesting of an estate in the State, one such being that all rights, title and interest of all the intermediaries shall cease and be vested in the State.\r\n1 2 provides that the Thekadars would acquire the rights of hereditary tenants in certain circumstances.\r\nIt reads as under; \"(1) Where any land was in personal cultivation of a person on the 1st day of May, 1950 as a Thekadar thereof and the theka was made with a view to the cultivation of the land by such thekedar personally, then notwithstanding anything in any law, document or order of court, he shall be deemed to be a hereditary tenant thereof entitled to hold, and when he has been ejected from the land after the said date, to regain possession as a hereditary tenant thereof liable to pay rent at hereditary rates.\r\n931 (2) The fact that the land comprised in the theka has been in the personal cultivation of the thekedar since the commencement of the theka shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 91 and 92 of the (I of 1872), be receivable in evidence for showing that the theka was of the nature referred to in sub section (1)\".\r\n1952 Act enacted certain supplementary provisions in respect of the 1950 Act.\r\n3 of 1952 Act provided that every person who was in cultivatory possession of any land during the year 1359 Fasli but is not a person who as a consequence of vesting under section 4 of the 1950 Act has become a bhumidar, sirdar, adhivasi or asami under section 18 to 21 of the said Act shall be and is hereby declared to be, with effect from the appointed date (b) if the bhumidar or sirdar was not such a person, an adhivasi, and shall be entitled to all the rights and be subjected to all the liabilities conferred or imposed upon an asami or an adhivasi.\r\nThere is an explanation to the section which is not material.\r\nOriginal lessees claimed that they have acquired the status of Adhivasi under section 3 of 1952 Act.\r\nIt is not in dispute that the original plaintiffs were Thekedars.\r\nIt was however contended that unless the Theka was exclusively far personal cultivation of the land comprised in the Theka, the Thekedars would not acquire the status of hereditary tenants.\r\nSec. 12 which has been extracted herein before specifically provides that where any land is in personal cultivation of a person on the 1st day of May, 1950, as a Thekedar thereof and the Theka was made with a view to the cultivation of the land by such Thekedar personally then notwithstanding anything in any law, document or order of court, he shall be deemed to be hereditary tenant thereof entitled to hold, and when he has been ejected from the land after the said date, to regain possession as a hereditary tenant thereof liable to pay rent at hereditary rates.\r\nThis section came in for interpretation in Babu Noorul Hasan Khan vs Ram Prasad Singh & Ors (1) wherein it was held that a Thekedar of an Estate ceases to have any right to hold or possess as such any land in such Estate with effect from the date of its vesting.\r\nBut this is subject to two exceptions; one such being as enacted in 5.\r\nl 2 which provides that if such land was in personal cultivation of a person on the 1st day of May, 1950, as a 932 thekedar thereof and if the theka was made with a view to the A cultivation of land by such thekedar personally, then because of the non obstante clause occurring in sub sec.\r\n(I) of section 12 of the Act, the Thekedar would be deemed to be a hereditary tenant of the land entitled to hold land as such and liable to pay rent at hereditary rates.\r\nIf such hereditary tenant has lost possession he is entitled to regain his possession.\r\nIt was further held that if, however, the land was in personal cultivation of the Thekedar merely as a Thekedar appointed to collect rent from other tenants and incidentally allowed to cultivate the Sir or Khudkasht land of the lessor then he will be a mere Asami in accordance with sec.\r\n13(2) of the Act.\r\nThis interpretation of sec.\r\n12 was re affirmed in Raghunandan Singh & Ors.\r\nvs Brij Mohan Singh & Ors(1) It would thus appear well settled that before a Thekedar can claim the status of a hereditary tenant, he must not only be a Thekedar but the Theka must be specifically granted for personal cultivation of the land included in the Theka by the Thekedar.\r\nThe question therefore, is whether in this case the land included in the Theka of the original plaintiffs provided for personal cultivation of the land by the Thekedar or personal cultivation was incidental to other rights and obligations such as collection of rent .\r\nfrom the other tenants ? This would necessitate examination of the original document creating Theka.\r\nThat was not read to us, but Mr. Rangarajan relied upon the following observation in the judgment of the learned trial Judge: \"I have read the context (sic) (possibly contract, of the Thekanama.\r\nThere is no authority given specifically or impliedly for personal cultivation by the Thekedars of the land comprised in the Theka unless there was such a provision.\r\nI fear no rights of hereditary tenancy could have been acquired by the plaintiffs.\r\n\" It was urged that the learned Judge specifically came to the conclusion that the Theka was not created exclusively and specifically for personal cultivation of the lands involved in the Theka.\r\nThe learned appellate Judge found that the Thekedars were in actual possession and personal cultivation of the land for a period of 11 years.\r\nHe further found that the Theka would be deemed to have been granted for 933 personal cultivation and if the plaintiffs (Thekedars) have been found to be in personal cultivation of the suit on 1st May, 1950 as Thekedars, they would be entitled to the benefit of sec.\r\n12 of 1950 Act.\r\nThe learned appellate Judge then concluded that it is satisfactorily proved that the plaintiffs Thekedars were in possession on 1st May, 1950.\r\nHowever the learned Judge declined to grant relief to the plaintiffs on the finding that the lessees had acquired Adhivasis right under 1952 Act.\r\nIt clearly transpires from the findings of the first appellate court, which is the last fact finding court, that the Theka was for personal cultivation of the land involved in the Theka and the Thekedars were personally cultivating the land for a period of 11 years.\r\nThe High Court in second appeal noticed that the Thekedars were personally cultivating the land.\r\nNothing was pointed out to us to show that Thekedars had any other duty to perform such as collecting rent from other tenants.\r\nThere is nothing in the record to show that the Theka was as a consideration for some other duties to be performed by the Thekedars to the Zamindars.\r\nTherefore, the conclusion is inescapable, that the Theka was created exclusively for personal cultivation of the land involved in the Theka by the Thekedars.\r\nIf it is clearly established that the Theka was created exclusively for personal cultivation of the land by the Thekedars, the ratio of the decision of this Court would lead to the conclusion that the Thekedars acquired the status of the hereditary tenants under sec.\r\n12 of the 1 950 Act.\r\nThe only question then remains for the consideration is whether the original lessees acquired Adhivasis rights under sec.\r\n3 of the 1952 Act.\r\nSec. 3 which has been extracted herein before provides that any person who has not become a bhumidar, sirdar, adhivasi or asami under 1950 Act if he is in cultivatory possession of any land during the year 1359 Fasli and if the bhumidar or sirdar was not such a person, such a person in cultivatory possession would acquire the status of an adhivasi.\r\nThe High Court then examined what is the significance of the expression 'cultivatory possession ' in sec.\r\nThe High Court rightly held that if the Thekedars had acquired the status of hereditary tenants as Theka was up to and inclusive of the year 1359 Fasli, the Zamindars had no right to induct lessees in possession after depriving the Thekedars of their possession and therefore possession of the lessees was not 934 lawful against the Thekedars.\r\nThe High Court rightly held that A the lessees could not be said to be in cultivatory possession of the land on the appointed day.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the High Court relied upon a decision of this Court in Sonawati & ors.\r\nvs Shri Ram Anr.(1) The Court held as under: \"The expression \"cultivatory possession\" is not defined in the Act, but the Explanation clearly implies that the claimant must have a lawful right to be in possession of the land, and must not belong to the classes specified in the explanation.\r\n\"Cultivatory possession\" to be recognized for the purpose of the Act must be lawful and for the whole year 1359 Fasli.\r\nA trespasser who has no right to be in possession by merely entering upon the land forcibly or surreptitiously cannot be said to be a person in \"cultivatory possession\" within the meaning of section 3 of U.P. Act of 1952.\r\nWe are of the view that the Allahabad High Court was right in holding in Ram Krishna vs Bhagwan Baksh Singh(2) that a person who through force inducts himself over and into some land and succeeds in continuing his occupation over it cannot be said to be in cultivatory possession of that land so as to invest him with the rights of an asami or an adhivasi, and we are unable to agree with the subsequent judgment of a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Nanhoo Mal vs Muloo and ors.(B) that occupation by a wrongdoer without any right to the land is 'cultivatory possession ' within the meaning of section 3 of the U.P. Act 31 of 1952\".\r\nTherefore in order to obtain the benefit of sec.\r\n3 of 1952 Act, the person claiming to be in cultivatory possession must show that his or her possession was lawful.\r\nThe High Court consistent with certain findings of the trial Court and the first appellate court held that possession of the lessees in 1359 Fasli was not lawful and this necessarily follows from the finding given by the courts that the Thekedars were in cultivatory possession of the plots in dispute on the appointed day i.e. 1st May, 1950 and thereby became entitled to acquire the rights of hereditary tenants.\r\nWe are in agreement with the conclusion recorded by the High Court.\r\n935 It must therefore follow as a necessary corollary that the lessees did not acquire the right of adhivasi and the hereditary A tenants would be entitled to a decree for possession.\r\nAccordingly, the appeals fail and must be dismissed.\r\nThe appeals are thus dismissed with costs.\r\nH.S.K. Appeals dismissed.",

Prabhakara for the appearing parties.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J.\r\nThe questions involved in these matters being common they are being disposed of by a common judgment.\r\nAll these matters arise out of a common order of the A.P. Administrative Tribunal passed in Representation Petitions Nos.\r\n799\/77, 548\/79 and 140\/81.\r\nS.L.P. (Civil) No. 5218\/85 is filed against a separate order of the Tribunal in R.P. No. 1473\/80.\r\nThe dispute is regarding the inter se seniority between the Supervisors who are upgraded as Junior Engineers and the degree holders who are directly appointed as Junior Engineers.\r\nAll of them belong to the different branches in the A.P. Engineering Subordinate Service.\r\nFirst we shall state the relevant facts in each of the appeals and then formulate the points that arise for consideration.\r\nFor convenience sake we shall refer to the parties as arrayed before the Tribunal.\r\nCIVIL APPEAL NOS.\r\n752 AND 754\/84 : These two appeals are filed against the order in R.P. No. 799\/77.\r\nThe first one is filed by the State of A.P. and the other one by upgraded Supervisors Junior Engineers.\r\nThe petitioners before the Tribunal are all Junior Engineers in 300 Irrigation and Power Department.\r\nThey were initially appointed as temporary Junior Engineers in the year 1969\/70.\r\nLater they appeared in a special qualifying test (`SQT ' for short) held by the Public Service Commission and on the basis of the result of the test their services were regularised in the post of Junior Engineers with retrospective effect from the date of the temporary appointment subject to the maintenance of the order of ranking given by the Public Service Commission in the test.\r\nThe respondent Nos. 3 onwards in these R.Ps. are also Junior Engineers in the same department but they were appointed as Supervisors and on acquiring the degree they have been redesignated as Junior Engineers.\r\nSeveral G.O.Ms were issued by the Government and the important one is G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 559 (I & P) Department dated 18.7.77.\r\nThe post of Junior Engineers was made Gazetted post.\r\nThe case of the petitioners is that the respondents acquired degree qualification after 28.2.72 therefor they were not entitled to be appointed as regular Gazetted Junior Engineers and at any rate they cannot be treated as seniors on the basis of reckoning their seniority from the date of acquiring degree qualification and that the seniority of these graduate Supervisors should be reckoned from the date of their actual appointment as Junior Engineers and not from the date of acquiring degree qualification.\r\nThe respondent Supervisors, on the other hand contended that they are entitled to upgradation and weightage of service from the date of their appointment as Supervisors.\r\nCIVIL APPEAL NO.\r\n753\/84 : This appeal is filed against the order in R.P. No. 548\/79.\r\nThe petitioners in this R.P. are all Supervisors who graduated after 28.2.72.\r\nTheir contention was that they were appointed much before the respondents namely the directly recruited Junior Engineers and the services of the respondents Junior Engineers should not be regularised in such a way so as to effect the seniority of the petitioners and that the seniority of the petitioners should be reckoned from the notional date of appointment.\r\nCIVIL APPEAL NO.\r\n755\/84 : This appeal is filed against the order in R.P. No. 140\/81.\r\nThe sole petitioners before the Tribunal, who is a respondent here, questioned G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 466 Transport, Roads and Building and sought a declaration that he should be declared as senior to respondent Nos. 3 and 5 and promote him to the post of Assistant Engineer.\r\nThe petitioner before the Tribunal was directly recruited Junior Engineer.\r\nHe also passed the SQT held in the year 1975.\r\nThe respondents before the Tribunal were upgraded Supervisors who acquired the graduate qualification.\r\nG.O. Ms. No. 466 was issued 301 directing that the respondent before the Tribunal namely the upgraded Supervisors should be treated seniors to all the directly recruited Junior Engineers whose services were regularised on the basis of the SQT.\r\nThe Tribunal held that the findings in the other R.Ps.\r\n799\/77 and 548\/79 apply to the facts of this case also and accordingly directed to prepare an inter se seniority list in the Transport, Roads and Buildings Department on the lines indicated therein.\r\nR.P. was disposed of with those observations.\r\nThe upgraded Supervisors Junior Engineers who were the respondents before the Tribunal have filed this appeal.\r\nThese matters were heard together by the Tribunal.\r\nAfter considering the various G.O.Ms.\r\nand the arguments the Tribunal held that there was no bar to the retrospective regularisation of the services of the directly recruited Junior Engineers from the dates of their initial appointments.\r\nIt also held that the action of the Government in giving the benefit of the notional date of appointment to the upgraded Junior Engineers and the benefit of the date of regularisation of their services from the dates of their notional appointments subject to maintenance of order of ranking given by the Public Service Commission is justified.\r\nThe Tribunal further held that the order of ranking given by the Public Service Commission in respect of directly recruited Junior Engineers has to be maintained and each of them will have to be treated as being entitled to count his seniority from the date on which his service has been regularised or from the date of the regularisation of the service of the person immediately below him in the order of ranking given by the Public Service Commission, whichever is earlier.\r\nIn paragraph 23 of the Order the Tribunal specifically held thus: \"23.\r\nWe are of the opinion that once the dates from which the directly recruited Junior Engineers can claim seniority are thus fixed on the basis of this formula, it should not be difficult to fix their inter se seniority vis a vis the upgraded Junior Engineers on the basis of the notional dates of appointment given to the latter.\r\nIn this connection we would like to point out that, whereas in the case of an upgraded Junior Engineer who acquired degree qualification before 28.2.1972, seniority will have to be fixed by putting him below all the regular Junior Engineers including directly recruited Junior Engineers who are entitled to claim seniority from any date during the year in which such upgraded Junior Engineer has been given the notional date of appointment, this practice cannot be followed in case of an upgraded junior Engineer who has acquired degree qualification after 28.2.1972, in view of the fact that the provision for fixing his seniority below other Junior Engineers 302 of the particular year (as was made in G.O. Ms. No. 893 dated 15.6.72) was not made in the amended Rule as issued under G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 54 dt.\r\n15.2.1983 His seniority will, therefore have to be fixed on the basis of the specific notional date of appointment given to him by interspersing his name among the regular Junior Engineers as arranged in chronological order of dates from which such regular Junior Engineers (including directly recruited Junior Engineers) are entitled to count their seniority.\r\n\" It is this part of the Order that has given rise to all these appeals before us.\r\nThe State of A.P. being aggrieved by this Order filed C.A. No. 752\/84 and both petitioners and respondents namely the Junior Engineers directly recruited and upgraded Supervisors as Junior Engineers are the main respondents before us.\r\nCivil Appeal Nos. 753 54 are filed by the upgraded Supervisors Junior Engineers.\r\nIn these two matters the Junior Engineers directly recruited are the respondents.\r\nThus in all these matters the Junior Engineers directly recruited are the respondents.\r\nIt is contended on behalf of State of A.P. that the direction given by the Tribunal particularly interspersing is not workable.\r\nLearned counsel for the State, however, pointed out that the upgraded Supervisors have put in long years of service and they have been discharging the same duties as directly recruited Junior Engineers and that this fact also has to be borne in mind in fixing the notional date of appointment of the two categories officers and in fixing their inter se seniority.\r\nShri B.Kanta Rao, learned counsel appearing for all the upgraded Supervisors Junior Engineers contended that in G.O. Ms. No. 559 it is specifically laid down that Supervisor who have acquired graduate qualification may be appointed as Junior Engineers after 28.2.72 and the weightage of four years should be reckoned from the date of acquiring the degree qualification i.e. 28.2.72 or thereafter.\r\nHe also contended that the seniority of the upgraded Supervisor Junior Engineers should not be fixed from the date of the Order of appointment dated 8.8.77.\r\nOn behalf of the directly recruited Junior Engineers Shri K.Madhava Reddy, learned counsel submitted that the upgraded Supervisors can under no circumstances be treated as seniors to the directly recruited Junior Engineers.\r\nAccording to him appointment of Junior Engineers was suspended for some time and in view of the exigencies the degree holders were appointed on temporary basis and they have served for a number of years.\r\nLater the Government decided to make regular appointments and accordingly a Special 303 Qualification Test was held and such of those temporary Junior Engineers who were degree holders got qualified and were given the appointments and a seniority list strictly on the basis of performance in the test and on merit was prepared by the Public Service Commission and a retrospective effect was given.\r\nHis further submission was that so far as the upgraded Supervisors are concerned all the relevant G.O.Ms.\r\nmake it clear that the crucial date has to be reckoned on the basis of the actual date of appointment and not on the date of acquiring the degrees.\r\nFor appreciating these rival contentions it becomes necessary to refer to some of the G.O.Ms.\r\nparticularly with a view to arrive at the (\"crucial date\") in respect of each of these categories for the purpose of fixation of the seniority.\r\nIn respect of upgraded Supervisors who acquired a degree, certain G.O.Ms. were issued from time to time.\r\nIn the year 1972 G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 893 dated 15.6.72 was issued amending the special rules for the A.P. Engineering Subordinate Service.\r\nThe same provided that Supervisors who while in service acquire B.E.\/A.M.I.E. degree qualification, shall be entitled to count 50% of the service rendered as Supervisors prior to the acquisition of such qualification subject to a maximum limit of four years.\r\nThis was subject to certain conditions.\r\nOne of the conditions was that they should be considered to have been placed below the last of the Junior Engineer of the year after giving such weightage.\r\nIn the year 1976 another G.O.Ms No. 451 (I & P) dated 10.6.76 ordered that the Supervisors who acquire the graduate qualification while in service should be appointed as Junior Engineers with immediate effect.\r\nOn 8.11.76 G.O.Ms. No.815 (I & P) was issued.\r\nClause 4 of the Conditions stipulated in G.O.Ms.\r\nNo.893 was amended and the benefit of the weightage was directed to be given effect only to those who acquired the aforesaid degree qualification prior to 28.2.72.\r\nThen came the important G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 559 (I & P) dated 18.7.77.\r\nRelying on the contents of the above G.O.Ms.\r\nthe upgraded Supervisors claimed that the weightage of four years should be reckoned from the date of acquiring the qualification and not from the date of actual appointment.\r\nThe directly recruited Junior Engineers also based their claim on G.O. Ms. Ms. Nos. 451 and 559 and they further contended that the upgraded Supervisors should be treated as regularly appointed only with effect from the date of their appointment.\r\nIt may not be necessary for the purpose of this case to extract the entire contents of the G.O. Ms. that preceded G.O. Ms. Nos. 451 and 559.\r\nIt would suffice if we just give the gist of those respective G.O.Ms.\r\nUnder G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 787 dated 9.6.71 the Government declared that posts of 304 Junior Engineers would be filled in by graduate Engineers which will be made a separate category and they will be made gazetted.\r\nTherefore G.O.Ms. No.240 dated 28.2.72 was issued.\r\nUnder the said G.O.Ms. 1870 posts of Supervisors in Public Works Department were declared to constitute a category of Junior Engineers and similarly in the Roads and Buildings Department 620 posts were declared to constitute as a category of Junior Engineer as distinct from Supervisors and both these categories were made gazetted with effect from that date.\r\nThe G.O.Ms. also provided for temporary appointments in the case of qualified Junior Engineers being not available for filling up all such gazetted posts, and all these posts of Junior Engineers in both the Departments were declared to be within the purview of the A.P. Public Service Commission and the method of recruitment to the post of Junior Engineer should be by direct recruitment.\r\nThen came the G.O. Ms. No. 893 dated 15.6.72 amending the special rules for the A.P. Engineering Subordinate Service under which the Supervisors who acquired the qualification were declared to be entitled to count 50% of their service subject to a maximum limit of four years for the purpose of promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer from Junior Engineer.\r\nG.O.

Ms. No. 786 dated 7.8.74 and the adhoc rules were framed enabling the computation of period of two years with or without break in the service rendered by such degree holders Junior Engineers who appeared in the SQT held by the Public Service Commission and were declared to be selected and thus their services were regularised retrospectively giving them the benefit of the service of two years rendered prior to the actual selection.\r\nIn conformity with the same Rule 33A was also relaxed for the purpose of fixing their inter se seniority.\r\nThe next important G.O.Ms.\r\nwith which we are concerned is G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 451 dated 10.6.76.\r\nIt reads as under: \"GOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH ABSTRACT Establishment Irrigation and Power Department Appointment of Supervisors who have acquired Graduate Qualification as Junior Engineers Orders Issued.\r\nIrrigation and Power (Ser.II) Department G.O.

M. GOPALAKRISHNAN, SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT.\r\n\" G.O. Ms. No. 451 is referred to in this G.O.Ms.\r\nand in the Preamble it is clearly noted that the appointments of the upgraded Supervisors as Junior Engineers should be temporary and prospectively only.\r\nIn Paragraph 2 (i) it is also made abundantly clear that they will not be entitled for appointment as Junior Engineers automatically from the date of acquisition of degree qualification.\r\nComing to the weightage it is clarified in paragraph 2 (ii) to the effect that a Supervisor who is appointed as Junior Engineer shall be entitled to count 1\/3rd of the service rendered by him as Supervisor, before his appointment as Junior Engineer, subject to a maximum of four years and the same would be taken into account to render the appointee eligible for consideration for promotion as Assistant Engineer.\r\nParagraph 2 (iii) is very important regarding the seniority and the same has to be fixed with reference to the notional date arrived at after giving weightage of service, Paragraph 2 (v) gives a clue that the weightage could be from the date of appointment.\r\nThe Government, however, issued proceedings dated 8.8.77 and fixed the seniority of these upgraded Supervisors who acquired the degree qualification from the date of acquiring the degree.\r\nWe have already noted that vide G.O. Ms. No. 893 the special rules were amended.\r\nAfter the G.O. Ms. No. 559 was issued, representations were made by the Association of Andhra Junior Engineers as well as from the Diploma holders Engineers Association.\r\nHaving considered these representations, the Government came out with another G.O. Ms. No. 593 dated 29.7.77 and clarified that the rules only refer to the date of appointment and does not refer to selection and that the seniority of an individual or a class or category has to be fixed according to the date of his first 308 appointment and not with reference to the date of selection and the Chief Engineer (General) was requested to fix the seniority accordingly.\r\nThe Chief Engineer (General) Vide proceedings No. Rc.\r\nMI\/58062\/74 75 dated 8.8.77 fixed the seniority.\r\nBut in doing so he has taken the date of passing the examination by the upgraded Junior Engineers as the date of appointment.\r\nAs already noted this fixation of seniority was questioned before the Tribunal.\r\nFrom the above resume of all the G.O.Ms.\r\nit is clear that an interpretation of G.O. Ms. No. 559 would be decisive in the these matters.\r\nIn our view the G.O. Ms. No. 559 makes it abundantly clear that the appointments of these upgraded Supervisors who acquired the graduate qualification while in service, would be prospective only and that they would be entitled to the weightage of four years of service rendered before the appointment.\r\nThe G.O. Ms. does not anywhere indicate that the weightage should be from the date of acquiring the degree qualification.\r\nIt must be borne in mind that it is only after acquiring such degree qualification that a Supervisor is appointed as Junior Engineer and having regard to the service rendered by him the Government as a policy decided to give weightage of four years for the purpose of considering the eligibility for promotion as Assistant Engineer.\r\nIn this context it is pertinent to note that the degree holders were appointed temporarily because of a ban and later the Government again as a policy decision decided to make regular appointments by direct recruitment but enabled the degree holders who are in temporary service to appear in a SQT.\r\nAgain as a matter of policy the Government decided to give some weightage to the service rendered by them before the appointment by selection.\r\nIt can thus be seen that the Government in fixing the seniority for the purpose of future promotion of the appointees both the upgraded as well as those selected by the Public Service Commission in SQT has taken into account the past service rendered by them.\r\nIn the case of upgraded Junior Engineers weightage of four years ' service is given and in the other case two years ' weightage is given.\r\nIn this context it is contended on behalf of the upgraded Junior Engineers that the regularisation of the direct Junior Engineers retrospectively that is with effect from two years prior to the date of their appointments is unwarranted.\r\nIn this context the Tribunal has rightly pointed out that under Rule 23 A of the A.P. State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1962 if a person having been appointed temporarily under Rule 10 to a post borne on the cadre is subsequently appointed in the service in accordance with the rules he shall commence his probation from such subsequent date or the earlier date as the appointing authority may determine.\r\nWe agree with the Tribunal that there is no bar to the retrospective regularisa 309 tion of the service of the direct Junior Engineers.\r\nHowever, in the instant case, it was a special selection by SQT restricted to the directly recruited Junior Engineers who had put in two years of service and the objective was to regularise their services.\r\nAs stated supra as a matter of policy the Government gave weightage to both the categories.\r\nIn Devi Prasad and others vs Government of Andhra Pradesh and others.\r\nAIR 1980 SC 1185, G.O. Ms. No.893 referred to above was questioned on the ground of unreasonableness in the matter of giving weightage to the upgraded supervisors.\r\nThis Court held that in the light of their experience there is nothing unreasonable in giving them limited benefit or weightage.\r\nIt was further observed as under: \"Ultimately; it is a matter of Government policy to decide what weightage should be given as between two categories of Government servants rendering somewhat similar kind of service.\r\nIn the present case, there may be truth in the case of the appellants that they are hit hard because of the new rule.\r\nDr. Chitale tried to convince us of the hardship that his clients sustain consequent on this rule and weightage conferred thereby.\r\nBut mere hardship without anything arbitrary in the rule does not call for judicial intervention, especially when it flows out of a policy which is not basically illegal.\r\nHowever, Government must be interested in keeping its servants specially in strategic areas like engineering contended and efficient.\r\nIn so producing contentment, it may have to evolve a flexible policy which will not strike a group as inflicting hardship on them.\r\nA sense of justice must permeate both the groups.\" However, the upgraded Junior Engineers who having got the benefit of four years ' service cannot be heard to say that similar weightage cannot be given to the direct recruits who prior to the selection were working on temporary basis.\r\nShri Kanta Rao, learned counsel relied on the decisions of this Court in Smt.\r\nM.Nirmala and other vs State of Andhra Pradesh and others etc., [1986]3 SCC 647; Ashok Gulati and others vs B.S. Jain and others.\r\n, [1986] Supp. SCC597; Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers ' Association vs State of Maharashtra and others, [1990] 2SCC 715 and Masood Akhtar Khan and others vs State of Madhya Pradesh and others, and contended that both the categories were discharging the same duties and there should not be any discrimination.\r\nLearned counsel also relied on some unreported judgments of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in writ Petitions Nos.\r\n1929, 1006 and 2387\/ 310 73 and also Writ Petitions Nos.\r\n3897\/72.\r\nWe have perused all these judgments and we are of the view that such a question did not arise in these cases.\r\nThe question to be considered is from which date the weightage of four years ' service should be given to the upgraded Junior Engineers namely the Supervisors.\r\nIs it the date of acquiring the degree qualification or the date of their appointment? Having given our earnest consideration and for the reasons stated above we hold that the weightage can be given only from the date of their appointment.\r\nThe Tribunal in the course of its order, however, observed that in accordance with the existing rules the appointments of these Junior Engineers from the notional date have to be cleared by the Public Service Commission and the appointments cannot be held to be regular appointments as long as they are not approved by the Public Service Commission.\r\nHaving referred to the Rules, the Tribunal in paragraph 18 observed thus: \"We thus find that the appointment of the upgraded JEs as well as the direct JEs to the Gazetted posts have not been made strictly in accordance with the Rules and, hence, it is necessary for the Government to issue specific orders after following the procedure laid down in the Rules, in regard to their appointment to the Gazetted post of `Junior Engineers.\r\n\" Having so observed the Tribunal suggested some working formula in the meanwhile.\r\nIn evolving this formula the Tribunal further held thus.\r\n\"Thus, after having examined the points raised for and against the action taken by the Government in giving the upgraded Junior Engineers the benefit of the notional dates of appointment given to them and in giving the direct Junior Engineers benefit of the dates of the regularisation of their services from the dates of their initial appointment subject to the maintenance of the order ranking given by the P.S.C., we feel that the Government action in this respect was quite justified.\r\n\" Towards the end the Tribunal, however, observed that the seniority of the upgraded Junior Engineers who acquired the degree qualification before 28.2.72 will have to be fixed by putting them below all the regular Junior Engineers.\r\nLikewise those who have acquired the degree qualification after 28.2.72 their seniority have to be fixed on the basis of notional date of appointment by \"interspersing\" among the regular Junior Engineers.\r\nThe learned counsel for the State of A.P. submitted that this exercise of \"interspersing\" becomes impossible at this stage.\r\n311 Having given our careful consideration particularly to the fact that this litigation has been pending for the last so many years, about two decades.\r\nWe feel that it is high time a finality has to be reached by resolving the controversies and in this context we are of the view that the approval of the Public Service Commission in respect of these appointments need not be sought, if the Government has not already obtained the approval of the Public Service Commission.\r\nTo sum up, our conclusions are as under: (i) The weightage of four years in respect of upgraded Junior Engineers as provided in G.O. Ms. No. 559 has to be reckoned from the date of appointment and not the date of their acquiring the degree qualification; (ii) On the basis of that notional date, their inter se seniority has to be fixed; (iii) The regularisation of the degree holder Junior Engineers who passed the SQT by giving retrospective effect cannot be held to be illegal, and their seniority among themselves shall be subject to the order of ranking given by the Public Service Commission on the basis of the SQT; (iv) The Government shall prepare a common seniority list of the degree holders Junior Engineers and the upgraded Junior Engineers on the above lines and that list shall be the basis for all the subsequent promotions.\r\nPromotions, if any, already given shall be reviewed and readjusted in accordance with the said seniority list; and (v) The approval of the Public Service Commission in respect of these appointments and their seniority thus fixed need not be sought at this distance of time.\r\nAccordingly Civil Appeal Nos. 752 55\/84 are disposed of as per the directions given above.\r\nThere will be no order as to costs.\r\nS.L.P.(C) No. 5218\/85: This Special Leave Petition arises out of a separate order passed by the A.P. Administrative Tribunal in R.P. No. 1473\/80.\r\nThe petitioners before the Tribunal belong to A.P. Panchayati Raj Engineering Department in Zone No. 1.\r\nThey are all graduates in Civil Engineering and were temporarily appointed as Junior Engineers originally in the Public Works Department in 1969.\r\nTheir services were terminated for want of vacancies.\r\nHowever, during the year 1973 they were again appointed in the A.P. Panchayati Raj Engineering Department.\r\nThey also appeared in the Spe 312 cial Qualifying Test and they were selected by the Public Service Commission and they were appointed as regular Junior Engineers.\r\nThey commenced their probation.\r\nThe respondents before the Tribunal were appointed as Supervisors and after they acquired the degree qualification they were designated as Junior Engineers.\r\nThe grievance of the petitioners was that the respondents could not have been put above the petitioners in the matter of seniority and their seniority should have been reckoned from the date of their acquiring the graduate qualification.\r\nG.O. Ms. No. 422 issued by the Department declaring them as seniors to the petitioners, was specifically questioned before the Tribunal.\r\nThe Tribunal held that the impugned G.O.Ms. is vitiated firstly on the ground that the principles of natural justice have not been observed and secondly that the petitioners before the Tribunal who were the direct recruits and who were selected by the Public Service Commission after holding the SQT, are entitled to count their service in the ranking of Junior Engineers from the date of their appointment subject to the order regarding the maintenance of ranking given by the Public Service Commission.\r\nThe said order of Tribunal is questioned in this Special Leave Petition by the upgraded Junior Engineers who were the respondents before the Tribunal.\r\nIn this petition also the grounds raised are the same as in Civil Appeal Nos. 752 55\/84.\r\nThe conclusion reached by us in the above matters also govern the points in this petition.\r\nAccordingly this Special Leave Petition is disposed of in terms of the directions given in Civil Appeal Nos. 752 55\/84.\r\nThere will be no order as to costs.\r\nW.P. (C) No. 3566\/85: This Writ Petition is filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.\r\nThe petitioners are all upgraded Junir Engineers of A.P. Panchayati Raj Engineering Service.\r\nThey have questioned G.O.Ms.\r\nNo. 376\/84 under which some promotions were made on the basis of the inter se seniority list of the direct recruits and upgraded Junior Engineers.\r\nThe conclusions reached by us in Civil Appeals Nos.\r\n752 55\/84 also govern the points raised in this Writ Petition.\r\nAccordingly the Writ Petition is disposed of in terms of the directions given in Civil Appeals Nos. 752 55\/84.\r\nThere will be no order as to costs.\r\nG.N.

Nandram Agarwalla, who is the sole proprietor Of a business which he carries on under the name and style of I Sriram Jhabarmull '.\r\nIt is a business, inter alia, of import and export of piece goods

Income tax Central, Calcutta, under section 5(7A) transferring the cases of the petitioner to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta.\r\nThese are the orders which are complained against as unconstitutional and void invalidating the proceedings which were continued and subsequently instituted by the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta, against the petitioner on the score of the unconstitutionality of section 5(7A) of the Act.\r\nIt may be noted, however that these orders were all prior to the Constitution and 240 having been made on July 27, 1946, as aforesaid were followed up by completed assessment proceedings in respect of the said respective years and also certificate proceedings under section 46(2) of the Act.\r\nThere were further orders dated December 15, 1947, and sometime in September, 1948, transferring the cases of the petitioner from the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta, to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle 1, Calcutta, and back from him to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle,IV Calcutta.\r\ndated July 27, 1946, which was passed under section 5(7A) of the Act.\r\nPetitions Nos.\r\n225 to 229 of 1956: These Petitions may be classed as the Raichur group.\r\nThey concern the assessment for the respective assessment years 1950 5l, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55.\r\nThe petitioner in each of them is the same individual, one Kalloor Siddannal who resides and carries on business in Raichur in the State of Hyderabad as commission agent and distributor of agricultural products.\r\nIncome tax was first imposed in the Hyderabad State in 1946 by a special Act of the Legislature and the petitioner was assessed under the Hyderabad Income tax Act by the Additional Income tax Officer, Raichur, for the assessment years 1948 49 and 1949 50.\r\nAs from April 1, 195o, the Indian Income tax Act was applied to Hyderabad but the Additional Income tax Officer, Raichur, continued to assess the petitioner.\r\nThe cases in respect of the assessment years 1950 51, 1951 52 and 1952 53 were pending before that officer and proceedings were taken in connection with the assessment for those years.\r\nOn December 21, 1953, however, the Commissioner of Income tax Hyderabad, issued a notification under section 5(7) ordering that the case of the petitioner should be transferred from the Additional income tax Officer, Raichur, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Hyderabad.\r\nThe latter officer continued the assessment proceedings and issued notices under section 22(.4) of the Act on July 1, 1954, November 2, 1954, November 30,1954, 241 December 19, 1954, and March 11, 1955, in respect of the said years of assessment.\r\nAssessments for the said years were made on March 21, 1955, and on April 24, 1955, the petitioner made an application under section 27 of the Act to reopen the assessment for the year 1950 51 as on default under section 23 (4) of the Act.\r\nIt appears, however, that shortly before May 19, 1955, the Commissioner of Income tax, Hyderabad, made another order under section 5 (7A) and section 64 (5)(b) of the Act transferring all the cases of the petitioner to the main Income tax Officer, Raichur.\r\nCuriously enough, the petitioner challenged both the orders one dated December 21, 1953, and the other made sometime in May, 1955, under section 5 (7A) of the Act and the proceedings continued and instituted by the respective officers thereunder as unconstitutional and void on the ground that section 5 (7A) was ultra vires the Constitution even though ultimately he was being assessed by the main Income tax Officer, Raichur, under the latter order.\r\nThis is the common question in regard to the ultra vires character of section 5 (7A) of the Act which is raised in all these petitions, though in regard to each group there are several questions of fact involving the consideration of the discriminatory character of the specific orders passed therein which we shall deal with hereafter in their appropriate places.\r\nSection 5 (7A) of the Act runs as under: \" 5 (7A) : The Commissioner of Income tax may transfer any ease from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another, and the Central Board of Revenue may transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nSuch transfer may be made at any 'stage of the proceedings, and shall not render necessary the reissue of any notice already issued by the Income tax Officer from whom the case is transferred.\r\n\" This sub section was inserted by section 3 of the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1940 (XL of 1940) which was passed as a result of the decision of the Bombay High Court in Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner of Income tax, (Central) (1) I.L.R. , 31 242 By the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1956 (XXVI of 1956) an explanation was added to section 5(7A) in the terms following as a result of the decision of this Court in Bidi Supply Co. v The Union of India(1): \" Explanation : In this sub section, I case ' in relation to any person whose name is specified in the order of transfer means all proceedings under this Act in respect of any year which may be pending on the date of the transfer,, and includes all proceedings under this Act which may be commenced after the date of the transfer in respect of any year.\r\n\" Section 5(7A) together with the explanation thus falls to be considered by us in these petitions.\r\nThe argument on behalf of the petitioners is that a. 64, sub sections(1) and (2) of the Act confer upon the assessee a valuable right and he is entitled to tell the taxing authorities that he shall not be called upon to attend at different places and thus upset his business.\r\nSection 5(7A) invests the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue with naked and arbitrary power to transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another without any limitation in point of time, a power which is unguided and uncontrolled and is discriminatory in its nature and it is open to the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue to pick out the case of one assessee from those of others in a like situation and transfer the same from one State to another or from one end of India to the other without 'specifying any object and without giving any reason, thus subjecting the particular assessee to discriminatory treatment whereas the other assessees similarly situated with him would continue to be assessed at the places where they reside or carry on business under section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act.\r\nThe discrimination involved in section 5(7A) is substantial in character and, therefore, infringes the fundamental right enshrined,in article 14 of the Constitution.\r\nIt also infringes article 19 (1) (g) in so far as it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or business (Vide Himmatlal Harilal Mehta vs The State of Madhya Pradesh(1)).\r\nThe very same question as regards the unconstitutionality of section 5(7A) of the Act had come up for decision before this Court in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India (supra).\r\nThe case of the assessee there had been transferred by the Central Board of Revenue under section 5(7A) of the get from the Income tax Officer, District 111, Calcutta, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ranchi.\r\nThe order was an omnibus wholesale order of transfer expressed in general terms without any reference to any particular case and with out any limitation as to time and was challenged as void on the ground that section 5(7A) under which it had been passed was unconstitutional.\r\nThis Court, by a majority judgment, after discussing the general principles underlying article 14, did not adjudicate upon that question, observing at p. 276: \"We do not consider it necessary, for the purpose of this case, to pause to consider whether the constitutionality of Sub section.(7A) of section 5 can be Supported on the principle of any reasonable classification laid down by this Court or whether the Act lays down any principle for guiding or regulating the exercise of discretion by the Commissioner or Board of Revenue or whether the sub section confers an unguided and arbitrary power on those authorities to pick and choose individual assessee and place that assessee at a disadvantage in comparison with other assessees.\r\nAll assessees are entitled to the benefit of those provisions except where a particular case or cases of a particular assessee for a particular year or years is or are transferred under sub section (7A) of section 5, assuming that section to be valid and if a particular case or cases is or are transferred his right under section 64 still remains as regards his other case or cases.\r\n\" The majority judgment then proceeded to consider the effect of such an omnibus order unlimited in point of time on the rights of the assessee and further observed in that context at p. 277: \" This order is calculated to inflict considerable inconvenience and harassment on the petitioner.\r\nIts books of account will have to be produced before the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ranchi a place hundreds of miles from Calcutta, which is its place of business.\r\nThere may be no suitable place where they can put up during that period.\r\nThere will certainly be extra expenditure to be incurred by it by way of railway fare, freight and hotel expenses.\r\nTherefore the reality of the discrimination cannot be gainsaid.\r\nIn the circumstances this substantial discrimination has been inflicted on the petitioner by an executive fiat which is not founded on any law and no question of reasonable classification for purposes of legislation can arise.\r\nHere \"the State\" which includes its Income tax department has by an illegal order denied to the petitioner, as compared with other Bidi mer chants who are similarly situate, equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws and the petitioner can legitimately complain of an infraction of his fundamental right under Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n\" The question as to the constitutionality of section 5 (7A) of the Act was thus left open and the decision turned merely on the construction of the impugned order.\r\n245 Learned counsel for the petitioners, however, lays particular stress on the observations of Bose, J., in the minority judgment which he delivered in that case whereby he held that sections 5 (7A) and 64 (5) (b) of the Act were themselves ultra vires article 14 of the Constitution and not merely the order of the Central Board of Revenue.\r\nThe learned Judge referred to a passage from the judgment of Fazl Ali, J., in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar(1) and also pointed out the decision of this Court in M\/S. Dwarka Prasad Laxmi Narain vs The State of Uttar Pradesh and Two Others(2) and observed: \" What is the position here? There is no hearing, no reasons are recorded: just peremptory orders transferring the case from one place to another without any warning; and the power given by the Act is to transfer from one end of India to the other; nor is that power unused.\r\nWe have before us in this Court a case pending in which a transfer has been ordered from Calcutta in West Bengal to Ambala in the Punjab.\" (p. 283) \"\r\nIf the Legislature itself had done here what the Central Board of Revenue has done and had passed an Act in the bald terms of the order made here transferring the case of this petitioner, picked out from others in a like situation, from one State to another, or from one end of India to the other, without specifying any object and without giving any reason, it would, in my judgment, have been bad.\r\nI am unable to see how the position is bettered because the Central Board of Revenue has done this and not Parliament.\" (p. 284 5) \"\r\nIn my opinion, the power of transfer can only be conferred if it is hedged round with reasonable restrictions, the absence or existence of which can in the last instance be determined by the courts; and the exercise of the power must be in conformity with the rules of natural justice, that is to say, the parties affected must be heard when that is reasonably possible, and the reasons for the order must be reduced, however briefly, to writing so that men may know that (1) ; , 309 310.`(2) ; 246 the powers conferred on these quasi judicial bodies are being justly and properly exercised.\" (p. 287)\r\nThe answer furnished on behalf of the State to this argument is fourfold: (i)that the provision contained in section 5 (7A) of the Act is a measure of administrative convenience enacted with a view to more conveniently and effectively deal with the cases of the assessees where the Commissioner of Income tax considers it necessary or desirable to transfer any case from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another or the Central Board of Revenue similarly considers it necessary or desirable to transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nThe real object with which section 5 (7A) was inserted by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1940 (XL of 1940), has been thus set out in the affidavit of Shri V. Gouri Shankar, Under Secretary, Central Board of Revenue, dated November 19, 1956, which is the pattern of all the affidavits filed on behalf of the State in these petitions: \" 4.\r\nI say that the provisions of section 5 (7A) were inserted by the Income tax Amendment Act, XL of 1940, with the object of minimising certain procedural difficulties.\r\nBefore this amendment was passed there was no specific provision in the Act for transferring a case from one Income tax Officer to another except by a long and circuitous course even at the request of the assessees.\r\nIn order therefore to be able to transfer the case from one 1.\r\nto another either because of the request of the assessee or for dealing with cases involving special features such as cases of assessees involving widespread activities and large ramifications or inter related transactions, power to transfer cases was conferred upon the Central Board of Revenue and the Commissioner of Income tax as the case may be.\r\nI say that the provisions of section 5 (7A) ate thus administrative in character. . (ii)that the assessee whose case is thus transferred is not subjected to any discriminatory procedure in the matter of his assessment.\r\nThe Income tax Officer to whom his case is transferred deals with it under the same procedure which is laid down in the relevant 247 provisions of the Act.\r\nThe decision of the Income tax Officer is subject to appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the assessee has the further right to appeal to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal and to approach the High Court and ultimately the Supreme Court, as provided in the Act.\r\nAll assessees, whether they are assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area where they reside or carry on business or their cases are transferred from one Income tax Officer to another, are subject to the same procedure and are entitled to the same rights and privileges in the matter of redress of their grievances, if any, and there is no dis crimination whatever between assessees and assessees; (iii)that the right, if any, conferred upon the assessee under section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act is not an absolute right but is circumscribed by the exigencies of tax collection and can be negatived as it has been in cases where the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, think it necessary or desirable to transfer his case from one Income tax Officer to another under section 5 (7A) of the Act having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\r\nThe argument of inconvenience is thus sought to be met in the same affidavit: \" 5. 1 further say that as a result of any transfer that may be made under the provisions of section 5 (7A) there is no discriminatory treatment with regard to the procedure and that no privileges and rights which are given to the assessees by the Income tax Act are taken away nor is the assessee exposed to any increased prejudice, punitary consequences or differential treatment.\r\nI say that in cases where transfers under this section are made otherwise than on request from assessees, the convenience of the assessees is taken into consideration by placing the case in the hands of an Income tax Officer who is nearest to the area where it will be convenient for the assessee to attend.\r\nIf on account of administrative exigencies this is not possible and the assessee requests that the examination of accounts or evidence to be taken should be in a place convenient to him, the I.T.O. complies with the request 248 of the assessee and holds the hearing at the place requested.\r\n\" Even if there be a difference between assessees who reside or carry on business in a particular area by reason of such transfers the difference is not material.\r\nIt is only a minor deviation from a general standard and does not amount to a denial of equal rights; (iv)that the power which is thus vested is a discretionary power and is not necessarily discriminatory in its nature and that abuse of power is not to be easily assumed where discretion is vested in such high officials of the State.\r\nEven if abuse of power may sometimes occur, the validity of the provision cannot be contested because of such apprehension.\r\nWhat may be struck down in such cases is not the provision itself but the discriminatory application thereof.\r\nThe petitioners rejoin by relying upon the following passage from the judgment of Fazl Ali, J., in The State Of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar, (Supra), which was referred to by Bose, J., in his minority judgment in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (Supra), at page 281: \" It was suggested that the reply to this query is that the Act itself being general and applicable to all persons and to all offenses, cannot be Said to discriminate in favour of or against any particular case or classes of persons or cases, and if any charge of discrimination can be leveled at all, it can be levelled only against the act of the executive authority if the Act is misused.\r\nThis kind of argument however does not appear to me to solve the difficulty.\r\nThe result of accepting it would be that even where discrimination is quite evident one cannot challenge the Act simply because it Is couched in general terms; and one cannot also challenge the act of the executive authority whose duty it is to administer the Act, because that authority will say: I am not to blame as I am acting under the Act.\r\nIt is clear that if the argument were to be ,accepted, article 14 could be easily defeated.\r\nI think the fallacy of the argument lies in overlooking the fact that the I insidious discrimination complained of is incorporated in the Act itself ', it being so drafted 249 that whenever any discrimination is made such discrimination would be ultimately traceable to it.\r\nThe pivot of the whole argument of the petitioners is the provisions contained in section 64(1) and (2) of the Act which prescribe the place of assessment.\r\nThey are: \" 64.\r\n(1) Where an assessee carries on a business, profession or vocation at any place, he shall be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area in which that place is situate or, where the business, profession or vocation is carried on in more places than one, by the Income tax Officer of the area in which the principal place of his business, profession or vocation is situate.\r\n(2)In all other cases, an assessee shall be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area in which he resides.\r\n\" These provisions were construed by the Bombay High Court in Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner Income tax, (Central), (supra), and Beaumont, C.J., observed at p. 657: \" In my opinion section 64 was intended to ensure that as far as practicable an assessee should be assessed locally, and the area to which an Income tax Officer is appointed must, so far as the 'exigencies of tax collection allow, bear some reasonable relation to the place where the assessee carries on business or resides.\" Kania, J., as he then was, went a step further and stated at p. 660: \"A plain reading of the section shows that the same is imperative in terms.\r\nIt also gives to the assessee a valuable right.\r\nHe is entitled to tell the taxing authorities that he shall not be called upon to attend at different places and thus upset his business.\r\n\" The learned Judges there appear to have treated the provisions of section 64(1) and (2) more as a question of right than as a matter of convenience only.\r\nIf there were thus a right conferred upon the assessee by the provisions of section 64(1) and (2) of the Act and that right continues to be enjoyed.\r\nby all the assessees except the 32 250 assessee whose case is transferred under section 5(7A) of the Act to another Income tax Officer outside the area where he resides or carries on business, the assessee can urge that, as compared with those other assessees, he is discriminated against and is subjected to inconvenience and harassment.\r\nIt is, therefore, necessary to consider whether any such right is conferred upon the assessee by section 64(1) and (2) of the Act.\r\nPrima facie it would appear that an assessee is entitled under those provisions to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the particular area where he ,resides or carries on business.\r\nEven where a question arises as to the place of assessment such question is under section 64(3) to be determined by the Commissioner or the Commissioners concerned if the question is between places in more States than one or by the Central Board of Revenue if the latter are, not in agreement and the assessee is given an opportunity of representing his views before any such question is determined.\r\nThis provision also goes to show that the convenience of the assessee is the main consideration in determining the place of assessment.\r\nEven so the exigencies of tax collection have got to be considered and the primary object of the Act, viz., the assessment of income tax, has got to be achieved.\r\nThe hierarchy of income tax authorities which is set up under Chapter 11 of the Act has been so set up with a view to assess the proper income tax payable by the assessee and whether the one or the other of the authorities will proceed to assess a particular assessee has got to be determined not only having regard to the convenience of the assessee but also the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nIn order to assess the tax payable by an assessee more conveniently and efficiently it may be necessary to have him assessed by an Income tax Officer of an area other than the one in which, he resides or carries on business.\r\nIt may be that the nature and volume of his business operations are such as require investigation into his affairs in a place other than the one where he resides or carries on business or that he is so, connected with various other individuals or organiza tions in the way of his earning his income as to render 251 such extra tertitorial investigation necessary: before he may be properly assessed.\r\nThese are but instances of the various situations which may arise wherein it may be thought necessary by the Income tax authorities to transfer his case from the Income tax, Officer of the area in which he resides or carries on business to, another Income tax Officer whether functioning in the same State or beyond it.\r\nThis aspect of the question wag emphasized by Beaumont, C.J., in Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner of Income tax, (Central), (supra), at page 146, when he used the expression \" as far as practicable \" in connection with the assessee 's right to be assessed locally and the expression \" so far as exigencies of tax collection allow \" in connection with the appointment of the Income tax Officer to assess the tax payable by the particular assessee.\r\nIn the later case of Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner of Income tax, (Central)(1), Beaumont, C.J., expressed himself as follows: \" The Income tax Act does not determine the place of assessment.\r\nWhat it does is to determine the Officer who is to have power to assess and in some cases it does so by reference to locality but I apprehend that an appeal would be not against an order of the Commissioner as to the place of assessment, but against the order of assessment of the Income tax, Officer,\" thus stating in effect that this section does not give a right to the assessee to have his assessment, at a parti cular place but determines the Income tax Officer who is to have power to assess him.\r\nThis aspect was further emphasized by the Federal Court in Wallace Brothers & Co. vs Commissioner of, Income tax, Bombay, Sind & Baluchistan (2), where Spens, C.J., observed: Clause (3) of section 64 provides that any question as to the place of assessment shall be determined ' by the Commissioner or by the Central Board of Revenue Proviso 3 to the clause enacts that if the place of assessment is called in question by the assessee, the Income tax Officer shall, if not satisfied, with the (1) , 101.(2) A.I.R. 1945 F.C. 9,13.252 correctness of the claim, refer the matter for determination under this sub section before assessment is made.\r\nThese provisions clearly indicate that the matter is more one of administrative convenience than of jurisdiction and that in any event it is not one for adjudication by the Court.\r\n\" It may be noted, however, that in the passage at page 276 of the majority judgment in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India (supra), this court regarded the benefit conferred on the assessee by these provisions of a. 64(1) and (2) of the Act as a right and it is, too late in the day for us to say that no such right to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the particular area, where he resides or carries on his business is conferred on the assessee.\r\nThis right, however, according to the authorities above referred to, is hedged in with the limitation that it has to yield to the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nThe position, therefore, is that the determination of the, question whether a particular Income tax Officer should assess the case of the assessee depends on (1) the convenience of the assessee as posited in section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act, and (2) the exigencies of tax collection and it would be open to the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue who are the highest amongst the Income tax.\r\nAuthorities under the Act to transfer the case of a particular assessee from the Income tax Officer of the area within which he resides or carries on business to any other Income tax Officer if the exigencies of tax collection warrant the same.\r\nIt is further to be noted that the infringement of such a right by the order of transfer, under section 5 (7A) of the Act is not a material infringement.\r\nIt is only a deviation of a minor character from the general standard and does not necessarily involve a denial of equal rights for the simple reason that even after such transfer the case is dealt with under the normal procedure which is prescribed in the Act.\r\nThe production and investigation of the books of account, the enquiries to be made by the Income tax Officer and the whole of the procedure as to assessment including the further 253 appeals after the assessment is made by the Incometax Officer are the same in a transferred case as in others which remain with the Income tax Officer of the area in which the other assesees reside or carry on business.\r\nThere is thus no differential treatment and no scope for the argument that the particular assessee is discriminated against with reference to others similarly situated.\r\nIt was observed by this Court in, M. K. Gopalan vs The State of Madhya Pradesh(1): \" In support of the objection raised under article 14 of the Constitution, reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in Anwar Ali Sarkar 's case.\r\nIn the pre ' sent case, the Special Magistrate under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code has to try the case entirely under the normal procedure, and 'no discrimination of the kind contemplated by the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar 'd case and the other cases following it arises here.\r\nA law vesting discretion in an authority under such circumstances cannot be said to be discriminatory as such, and is therefore not hit by article 14 of the Constitution.\r\nThere is, therefore, no substance in this contention.\"\r\nTo a similar effect were the observations of Mukherjea, J., as he then was, in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar, (supra), at p. 325: \"I agree with the Attorney General that if the differences are not material, there may not be any discrimination in the proper sense of the word and minor deviations from the general standard might not amount to denial of equal rights deemed never at any time to have applied to an assessee where, in consequence of any transfer made under section 5 (7A), a particular Income tax Officer has been charged with the function of assessing that assessee.\r\nsection 64 (5) was incorporated by the Income tax Law Amendment Act, 1940 (XL of 1940) simultaneously with section 5 (7A).\r\nIt is ' therefore, urged that an assesse whose case has been thus transferred has no right under section 64 (1) and (2) and those assessees alone who do not come within the purview of section 64 (5) can have the benefit of section 64 (1) and (2).\r\nThis argument, however, ignores the fact that section 5 (7A) is the very basis of the enactment of the relevant provision in section 64 (5) and if a. 5 (7A) cannot stand by virtue of its being discriminatory in character, the relevant portion of section 64 (5) also must fall with it.\r\nIt is then contended that a. 5 (7A) is in itself discriminatory and violative of the fundamental right en shrined in article 14.\r\nThe power which is vested in the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue is a naked and arbitrary power unguided and uncontrolled by any rules.\r\nNo rules have been framed and no directions given which would regulate or guide their discretion or on the basis of which such transfers can be made and the whole matter is left to the unrestrained will of the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue without there being anything which could ensure a proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon the injustice that might result from the improper execution of the same.\r\nTo use the words of Mr. Justice Matthews in the case of Yick Wo vs Hopkins(1): \". when we remember that this action or nonaction may proceed from enmity or prejudice, from partisan zeal or animosity, from favoritism and other improper influences and motives easy of concealment and difficult to be detected and exposed, it becomes unnecessary to suggest or comment upon the injustice capable of being wrought under cover of such a power, for that becomes apparent to every one who gives to the subject a moment 's consideration.\" , 373; , 227.255\r\nIn other words, \" it is not a question of an uncon stitutional administration of a statute otherwise valid on its face but here the unconstitutionality is writ large on the face of the statute itself \" (Per Das, J., as he then was, in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali, Sarkar, (supra) at p. 346).\r\nIt has to be remembered that the purpose of the Act is to levy income tax, assess and collect the same.\r\nThe preamble of the Act does not say so in terms it being an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to income tax and super tax but that is the purpose of the Act as disclosed in the preamble of the First Indian Income tax Act of 1886 (Act II of 1886).\r\nIt follows, therefore, that all the provisions contained in the Act have been designed with the object of achieving that purpose.\r\nThere is in the first instance, the charge of income tax.\r\nThen we find set up the various authorities in the hierarchy who are entrusted with the function of assessing the income tax, the Central Board of Revenue being at the apex.\r\nThere is also an Appellate Tribunal which is established for hearing appeals against the decisions of the Appellate Assistant Commissioners.\r\nThen follow the provisions in regard to taxable income, mode of assessment and cognate provisions.\r\nThe Income tax Officers are invested with the duty ' of assessing the income tax of the assessees in the first instance.\r\nThe Assistant Commissioners of Income tax, are the appellate authorities over the decisions of the Income tax Officers and the Income tax Appellate Tribunal is the final appellate authority barring of course references under section 66(1) of the Act to the High Court on questions of law.\r\nThe Commissioners of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue are mainly administrative authorities over the Income tax Officers and the Assistant Commissioners of Income tax and they are to distribute and control the work to be done by these authorities.\r\nAll officers and persons employed in the execution of the Act are to observe and follow the orders instructions and directions of the.\r\nCentral Board of Revenue which is the highest authority in the hierarchy and, even though normally in accordance 256 with the provisions of section 64 (1) and (2) the work of assessment is to be done by the Income tax Officers of the area within which the assessees reside or carry on business, power is given by section 5(7A) to the Commissioner of Income tax to transfer any case from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another and to the Central Board of Revenue to transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nThis is the administrative machinery which is set up for assessing the incomes of the assessees which are chargeable to income tax.\r\nThere is, therefore, considerable force in the contention which has been urged on behalf of the State that section 5(7A) is a provision for administrative convenience.\r\nNevertheless this power which is given to the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue has to be exercised in a manner which is not discriminatory.\r\nNo rules or directions having been laid down in regard to the exercise of that power in particular cases, the appropriate authority has to determine what are the proper cases in which such power should be exercised having regard to the object of the Act and the ends to be achieved.\r\nThe cases of the assessees which come for assessment before the income tax authorities are of various types and no one case is similar to another.\r\nthere are complications introduced by the very nature of the business which is carried on by the assessees and there may be, in particular cases, such widespread activities and large ramifications or inter related transactions as might require for the convenient and efficient assessment of income tax the transfer of such cases from one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nIn such cases the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, has to exercise its discretion with due regard to the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nEven though there may be a common attribute between the assesses whose case is thus transferred and the assessees; who continue to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area within which they reside or carry on business, the other attributes would not be common.\r\nOne assessee may 257 have such widespread activities and ramifications as would require his case to be transferred from the Income tax Officer of the particular area to an Income tax Officer of another area in the same State or in another State, which may be called \" X \".\r\nAnother assessee, though belonging to a similar category may be more conveniently and efficiently assessed in another area whether situated within the State or without it, called \" Y \".\r\nThe considerations which will weigh with the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue in transferring the cases of such assessee either to the area \" X \" or the area \" Y \" will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule can be laid down for determining whether the particular case should , be transferred at 'all or to an Income tax Officer of a particular area.\r\nSuch discretion would necessarily have to be vested in the authority concerned and merely because the case of a particular assessee is transferred from the Income tax Officer of an area within which he resides or carries on business to another Income tax Officer whether wit in or without the State will not by itself be sufficient to characterize the exercise of the discretion as discriminatory.\r\nEven if there is a possibility of discriminatory treatment of persons falling within the same group or category, such possibility cannot necessarily invalidate the piece of legislation.\r\nIt may also be remembered that this power is vested not in minor officials but in top ranking authorities like the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue who act on the information supplied to them by the Income tax Officers concerned.\r\nThis power is discretionary and not necessarily discriminatory and abuse of power cannot be easily assumed where the discretion is vested in such high officials.\r\n(Vide Matajog Dobey vs H. section Bhari(1)).\r\nThere is moreover a presumption that public officials will discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law.\r\n(Vide People of the State of (1) ; , 932.33 258 New York vs John E. Van De Carr, etc.(1)\r\nIt has also been observed by this Court in A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar vs M. Venkitachalam Potti(2) with reference to the possibility of discrimination between assessees in the matter of the reference of their cases to the Income tax Investigation Commission that \" It is to be presumed, unless the, contrary were shown, that the 'administration of a particular law would be done I not with an evil eye and unequal hand ' and the selection made by the Government of the cases of persons to be referred for investigation by the Commission would not be discriminatory.\" This presumption, however, cannot be stretched too far and cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reason for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile and discriminatory treatment (Vide Gulf, Colorado, etc.\r\nvs W. H. Ellis (3)).\r\nThere may be cases where improper execution of power will result in injustice to the parties.\r\nIt is pointed that it will be next to impossible for the assessee to challenge a particular order made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, as discriminatory because the reasons.\r\nwhich actuated the authority in making the order will be known to itself not being recorded in the body of the order itself or communicated to the assesse.\r\nThis apprehension is, however, ill founded.\r\nThough the (1) ; (1905) 310 199 U.S. 552; (2) (1955)2 section C. R. 1196.\r\n(3) ; ; 41 L.Ed. 666.\r\n(4) [1955] I S.C.R. 140.\r\n259 burden of proving that there is an abuse of power,lies on the assessee who challenges the order as discriminatory, such burden is not by way of proof to the hilt.\r\nThere are instances where in the case of an accused person rebutting a presumption or proving an.\r\nexception which will exonerate him from the liability for the offence with which he has been charged, the burden is held to be discharged by evidence satisfying the jury of the probability of that which the accused is called upon to establish (Vide Rex vs Carr Briant (1)), or in the case of a detenue under the Preventive Detention Act seeking to make out a case of want of bona fides in the detaining authority, the burden of proof is held not to be one which requires proof to the hilt but such as will render the absence of bona fides reasonably probable (Vide Ratanlal Gupta vs The District Magistrat of Ganjam also Brundaban Chandra Dhir Narendra vs The State of Orissa (Revenue Department) (3)).\r\nIf, in a particular ,case, the assessee seeks to impeach the order of transfer is an abuse of power pointing out circumstances which prima facie and without anything more would make out the exercise of the power discriminatory qua him, it will be incumbent on the authority to explain the circumstances under which the order has been made.\r\nThe court will, in that event, scrutinize these Circumstances having particular regard to the object sought to be achieved by the enactment of section 5(7A) of the Act as set out in para 4 of the affidavit of Shri V. Gouri Shankar, Under Secretary, Central Board of Revenue, quoted above, and come to its own conclusion as to the bona fides of the order and if it is not satisfied that the order was made by the authorities in bona fide exercise of the power vested in them under section 5(7A) of the Act, it will certainly quash the lame.\r\n(3) I.L.R. 1952 Cuttack 529, 573.260 record.\r\nThe observations of Fazl Ali, J., in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar, (supra), at pages 309 310 that the authority will say \" I am not to blame as I am acting under the Act \" will not necessarily save the order from being challenged because even though the authority purported to act under the Act its action will be subject to scrutiny in the manner indicated above and will be liable to be set aside if it was found to be mala fide or discriminatory qua the assessee.\r\nParticular stress is laid on behalf of the petitioners on the observations at page 277 of the majority judgment in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (supra), which in the context of the omnibus wholesale order in question emphasized the substantial discrimination to which the assessee there had been subjected as compared with other bidi merchants who were similarly situated.\r\nThe inconvenience and harassiment to which the assessee was thus put were considered to be violative of article 14 of the Constitution and it is urged that section 5 (7A) is unconstitutional in Boar as it is open to the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, to make an order of transfer subjecting the assessee to such inconvenience and harassment at their sweet will and pleasure.\r\nThis argument of inconvenience, however, is not conclusive.\r\nThere is no fundamental right in an assessee to be assessed in a particular area or locality.\r\nEven considered in the context of section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act this right which is conferred upon the assessee to be assessed in a particular area or locality is not an absolute right but is subject to the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nThe difference, if any, created in the position of the assessee qua others who continue to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area in which they reside or carry on business is not a material difference but a minor deviation from the general standard and would, therefore, not amount to the denial of equal rights (Per Mukherjea, J., as he then was, in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar., (supra), at 261 p. 325)).\r\nThere is also the further fact to be borne mind that this inconvenience to the assessee is sough to be minimised by the authority concerned transferring the case of such assessee to the Income tax Officer who is nearest to the area where it would be convenient for the assessee to attend and if, on account of administrative exigencies, this is not possible an the assessee requests that the examination of account or evidence to be taken should be in a place convenient to him, by the Income tax Officer complying with the request of the assessee and holding the hearing at the place requested.\r\nWe are bound to take the statement contained in para 5 of the affidavit of Shri.V. Gouri Shankar at its face value and if this is done as it should be, the assessee will not be put to any inconvenience or harassment and the proper balance between the rights of the subject and public interest will be preserved.\r\nIt is, therefore, clear that the power which is veste in the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, under section 5 (7A) of the Act is not a naked and arbitrary power, unfettered, unguided or uncontrolled so as to enable the authority to pick and choose one assessee out of those similarly circumstanced thus subjecting him to discriminatory treatment as compared with others who fall within the same category.\r\nThe power is guided and controlled by the purpose which is to be achieved by the Act itself, viz., the charge of income tax, the assessment and collection thereof, and is to be exercised for the more convenient and efficient collection of the tax A wide discretion is given to the authorities concerned for the achievement of that purpose, in the matter of the transfer of the cases of the assessees from one Income tax Officer to another and it cannot be urged that such power which is vested in the authorities is discriminatory in its nature.\r\nThere is a broad distinction between discretion which has to be exercised with regard to a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and some other right which is given by the statute.\r\nIf the statute deals with a right which is not fundamental in character 262 the statute can take it away but a fundamental right the statute cannot take away.\r\nWhere, for example, a discretion is given in the matter of issuing licences for carrying on trade, profession or business or where restrictions are imposed on freedom of speech, etc., by a imposition of censorship, the discretion must be controlled by clear rules so as to come within the category of reasonable restrictions.\r\nDiscretion of that nature must be differentiated from discretion in respect of matters not involving fundamental rights such as transfers of cases.\r\nAn inconvenience resulting from a change of place or venue occurs when any case is transferred from one place to another but it is not open to a party to say that a fundamental right has been infringed by such transfer.\r\nIli other words, the discretion vested has to be looked at from two points of view, ViZ., (1) does it admit of the possibility of any real and substantial discrimination, and (2) does it impinge on a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution? Article 14 can be invoked only when both these conditions are satisfied.\r\nApplying this test, it is clear that the discretion which is vested in the Com missioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Reevenue, as the case may be, under section 5 (7A) is not at all discriminatory.\r\nIt follows, therefore, that section 5 (7A) of the Act is not violative of article 14 of the Constitution and also does not impose any unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or business enshrined in article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.\r\nIf there is any abuse of power it can be remedied by appropriate action either under article 226 or under article 32 of the constitution and what can be struck down is not the provision contained in section 5 (7A) of the Act but the order passed thereunder which may be mala fide or violative,of these fundamental rights.\r\nThis challenge of the vires of section 5 (7A) of the Act, therefore, fails.\r\nWe may, however, before we leave this topic observe that it would be prudent if the principles of natural justice are, followed, where circumstances permit, before any order of transfer under section 5 (7A) of the Act is made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the 263 Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, and notice is given to the party affected and he is afforded a reasonable opportunity of representing his views on the question and the reasons of the order are reduced however briefly to writing.\r\nIt is significant that when any question arises under section 64 as to the place of assessment and is determined by the Commissioner or Commissioners or by the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, the assessee is given an opportunity under section 64(3) of representing his views before any such question is determined.\r\nIf an opportunity is given to the assessee in such case, it is all the more ,surprising to find that, when an order of transfer under section 5(7A) is made transferring the case of the assessee from one Income tax 'Officer to another irrespective of the area or locality where he resides or carries on business, he should not be given such an opportunity.\r\nThere is no presumption against the bona fides or the honesty of an assessee and normally the Income tax authorities would not be justified in refusing to an assessee a reasonable opportunity of representing his views when any order to the prejudice of the normal procedure laid down in section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act is sought to be made against him, be it a transfer from one Income tax Officer to another within the State or from an Income tax Officer within the State to an Income tax Officer without it, except of course where the very object of the transfer would be frustrated if notice was given to the party affected.\r\nIf the reasons for making the order are reduced however briefly to writing it will also help the assessee in appreciating the circumstances which make it necessary or desirable for the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, to transfer his case under section 5(7A) of the Act and it will also help the court in determining the bona fides of the order as passed if and when the same is challenged in court as mala fide or discriminatory.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Income tax authorities will observe the above procedure wherever feasible.\r\nThe next point of attack is that the orders which Were made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the 264 Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, in these petitions are omnibus wholesale orders of transfer coming within the mischief of Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (supra), and are, therefore, hit by the majority judgment in that case.\r\nThe answer of the State is that the orders are valid by virtue of the explanation to section 5(7A) which was added by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1956 (26 of 1956).\r\nThe main structure of section 5(7A) was, however, maintained and the explanation was added thereto in order to expand the connotation of the word \" case \" which was used in section 5(7A).\r\nThe manner in which this result was brought about is subject to criticism that the word ,case\" was thus really equated with the word \" file \" and when a case of a particular assessee was transferred under section 5(7A) it was meant that his whole file would be transferred from one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nThis inartistic mode appears, however to be adopted by the supposed necessity of maintaining section 5(7A) in the form in which it stood but what we have got to see is whether the desired result has been achieved by adding the explanation in the manner in which it was done.\r\nReading section 5(7A) and the explanation thereto, it is clear that when any case of a particular asssssee which is pending before an Income tax Officer is transferred from that officer to another Income tax Officer whether within the State or without it, all proceedings which are pending against him under the Act in respect of the same year as also previous years are meant to be transferred simultaneously and all proceedings under the 265 Act which may be commenced after the date of such transfer in respect of any year whatever are also included therei in so that the Income tax Officer to whom such case is transferred would be in a position to continue the pending proceedings and also institute further proceedings against the assessee in respect of any year.\r\nThe proceedings pending at the date of transfer can be thus continued but in the case of such proceedings the provision in regard to the issue of notices contained in the main body of section 5(7A) would apply and it would not be necessary to reissue any notice already issued by the Income tax Officer from whom the case is transferred.\r\nThis provision applies to pending proceedings which have been transferred leaving unaffected the further proceedings which may be commenced against the assessee after the date of the transfer where fresh notices would have to be issued.\r\nIt is, however, contended that the cases of the assessee which have been already closed in the previous years cannot be reopened by the Income tax Officer to whom the case of the assessee is thus transferred and the words \" after the date of transfer in respect of any year \" occurring at the end of the explanation are sought to be construed to mean \" after the date of the transfer in respect of the year of transfer \" thus rendering it incompetent to the Income tax Officer to whom the case is transferred to institute further proceedings in respect of cases of the assessee which have been already closed before the date of transfer.\r\nThis contention is, in our opinion, unsound.\r\nThe words used are \" in respect of any year\" and not \" in respect of the year \".\r\nMoreover they are to be read with the preceding words \"may be commenced \" and not with the words \"after the date of transfer\".\r\nA proper reading of the explanation will be that the inclusive part thereof refers to all proceedings under the Act which may be commenced in respect of any year after the date of the transfer.\r\nThe date of the transfer has relation only to the particular year in which the case of the assessee is thus transferred and to attach the words \" in respect of any year \" to the words \" after 34 266 the date of transfer\" do not make any sense.\r\nThe words \" in respect of any year \" appropriately go with the words \" which may commenced\" and read in this juxtaposition render the inclusive part of the explanation susceptible of a proper meaning.\r\nThe language of the explanation read in the manner suggested above is thus sufficient to dispel this contention of the petitioners.\r\nit follows, therefore, that the omnibus wholesale orders of transfer made against the petitioners by the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, are saved by the explanation to section 5(7A) and are not unconstitutional and void: It remains now to consider whether the individual orders against the petitioners are discriminatory in fact or are mala fide and in abuse of the power vested in the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, under section 5(7A) of the Act.\r\nPetitions Nos.\r\n211 to 215 of 1956, i.e., the Shiram Jhabarmull group, may be dealt with in the first instance as they have a peculiar characteristic of their own.\r\nThe orders complained against in these petitions were all made by the Commissioner of Income tax Central, Calcutta, on July 27, 1946, and further proceedings were entertained against the petitioners by the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta, immeasurable thereafter.\r\nAll these proceedings culminated in assessment orders and certificate proceedings under section 46(2) of the Act were also taken by the authorities against the petitioners for recovery of the tax so assessed before the advent of the Constitution.\r\nThe question, therefore, arises whether these orders of transfer can be challenged by the petitioners as unconstitutional and void.\r\nIt is settled that article 13 of the Constitution has no retrospective effect and if, therefore, any action was taken before the commencement of the Constitution in pursuance of the provisions of any law which was a valid law at the time when such action was taken, such action cannot be challenged and the law under 267 which such action was taken cannot be questioned as unconstitutional and void on the score of its infringing the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution (See Keshavan Madhava Menon vs The State of Bombay(1)).\r\nThe following observations of Das, J., as he then was, at p. 235 of that case, may be appropriately referred to in this context: \"As already explained, article 13(1) only has the effect of nullifying or rendering all inconsistent existing laws ineffectual or nugatory and devoid of any legal force or binding effect only with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights on and after the date of the commencement of the Constitution.\r\nIt has no retrospective effect and if, therefore, an act was done before the commencement of the Constitution in contravention of any law which, after the Constitution, becomes void with respect to the exercise of any of the fundamental rights, the inconsistent law is not wiped out so far as the past act is concerned, for, to say that it is, will be to give the law retrospective effect. .\r\nSo far as the past acts are concerned the law exists, notwithstanding that it does not exist with respect to the future exercise of fundamental rights.\" (See also Syed Qasim Razvi vs The State of Hyderabad(2) and Laxmanappa Hanumanthappa Jamkhandi vs Union of India(1)).\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that the petitioners are not entitled to complain against the said orders of transfer dated July 27, 1946.\r\n225 to 229 of 1956, i.e., the Raichur group, and Petitions Nos. 86, 87, 88, 111, 112 and 158 of 1956, i.e., the Amritsar group, all belong to the same category.\r\nIn the first group, there was an order of transfer on December 21, 1953, passed by the Commissioner of Income tax, Hyderabad, transferring the cases of the petitioner from the Additional Income tax Officer, Raichur, to the Income tax, Officer, Special Circle, Hyderabad.\r\nThere was, however, an order passed by the Commissioner shortly before May 19, 1955, transferring the cases of the petitioner from the Income tax (1) ; , 235.\r\n(2) (3) ; 268 Officer, Special Circle, Hyderabad, to the main Income tax Officer, Raichur.\r\nThe petitioner thus reverted to the Income tax Officer, Raichur, and it passes one 's imagination what possible argument he can urge on the score of inconvenience and harassment.\r\nThe whole attitude of the petitioner is motivated by an intention to delay the payment of income tax legitimately due by him to the Revenue trying to take advantage of a mere technicality.\r\nIn the second group, there were orders passed by the Commissioner of Income tax transferring the cases of the petitioners from the Income tax Officer, \"AWard, Amritsar, or the Income tax Officer, 'F 'Ward, Amritsar, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Amritsar.\r\nBoth these officers were situated in the same building and under the same roof.\r\nThe argument of inconvenience and harassment can, under these circumstances, be hardly advanced by them.\r\nThere is moreover another feature which is common to both these groups and it is that none of the petitioners raised any objection to their cases being transferred in the manner stated above and in fact submitted to the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officers to whom their cases had been transferred.\r\nIt was only after our decision in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (supra), was pronounced on March 20, 1956, that these petitioners woke up and asserted their alleged rights, the Amritsar group on April 20, 1956, and the Raichur group on November 5, 1956.\r\nIf they acquiesced in the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officers to whom their cases were transferred, they were certainly not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under article 32.\r\nIt is well settled that such conduct of the petitioners would disentitle them to any relief at the hands of this Court (Vide Halsbury 's Laws of England ', Vol.\r\nII, 3rd Ed., p. 140, para 265; Rex vs Tabrum, Ex Parte Dash(1); 0. A. 0.\r\nK. Lakshmanan Chettiar vs Commissioner, Corporation of Madras and Chief Judge,Court of Small Causes, Madras(2) ).\r\nThe orders of transfer made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the (1) (2) [1927] 1.\r\nL. R. 269 case may be, against the three groups of petitioners, viz., Sriram Jhabarmull group, the Raichur group and the Amritsar group, cannot, therefore, be challenged by them as unconstitutional and void This leaves two sets of petitioners, the petitioners in Petitions Nos.\r\n97 & 97 A of 1956 and the petitioners in Petitions Nos.\r\n44\/56 and 85\/56.\r\nPetitions Nos.\r\n97 & 97 A of 1956 : The petitioners are oilmill owners, merchants and commission agents, carrying on business at Sahibganj in the district of Santhal Parganas and have a branch at 97, Lower Chitpur Road, Calcutta.\r\nThey were alleged to have concealed income exceeding Rs. 8 lakhs and indulged in business activities spread over a wide area resulting in large profits not disclosed in the books of account or in the various returns filed by them.\r\nAfter the judgment of this Court in Surajmull Mohta & Co. vs A. V. Viswanatha Sastri(2), about 320 cases referred to the Income tax Investigation Commission under section 5 (4) of Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act (XXX of 1947) were affected and had to be reopened under section 34 (IA) of the Income tax Act.\r\nTo dispose of these cases, \"since they involved many back years ' cases\" quickly and promptly, special circles without reference to area were created at Bombay and Calcutta, because the existing circles, whose hands were full, could not take up this extra work.\r\nThese 320 cases were distributed between these circles on the basis of the geographical area to which these assessees belonged.\r\nThe petitioners belonged to Bihar and had a branch at Calcutta and their cases were, therefore, allotted to one of the Central Circles at Calcutta.\r\nLater on in October 1954, this Court struck down section 5 (1) of the Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act (XXX of 1947) in Meenakshi Mills Ltd. vs Viswanatha Sastri.\r\n(2 ) and as a result thereof cases referred under that section and pending with the (I) [1055] 1 S.C. R. 448.\r\n(2) [1955] I S.C. R. 787.\r\n270 Income tax Investigation Commission on July 17,1954, could not be preceded with under the provisions of that Act.\r\nThese cases numbering about 470 had to be reopened under section 34 (1A) of the Income tax Act.\r\nThe Government thought that as in the earlier lot of cases, it would help speedier disposal of the cases, if they were allotted to Income tax Officers appointed without reference to area to deal with the same.\r\nIn addition to the circles already created in Bombay and Calcutta, five more circles at Calcutta and 4 more circles at Bombay and 9 more circles at important centers such as Kanpur, Ahmedabad, Madras and Delhi were set up to deal with all these cases.\r\nAs a result of the influx of these cases, it was found that the 9 circles at Calcutta had about 280 cases of assessees belonging to Calcutta itself to dispose of and therefore cases not belonging to that area had to be taken out and assigned to one of the newly created circles, Where the work load was low.\r\nIt was found then that Central Circle VI had a lower work load compared to other circles and, therefore, the cases of the petitioners were transferred to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle VI, Delhi.\r\nHaving regard to these circumstances which are disclosed in the affidavits of Shri V. Gouri Shankar, Under Secretary, Central Board of Revenue, dated November 19, 1956, and December 3, 1956, it is clear that the transfer of the cases of the petitioners, firstly, from the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Patna, to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle XI, Calcutta, and next, from the latter officer to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle VI, Delhi, were made as a matter of administrative convenience only.\r\nIt further appear; from the said affidavits that the examination of accounts and the evidence was done at the places desired by the assessees in order to suit their convenience and the Income tax Officers were instructed accordingly.\r\nAs a matter of fact the Income tax Officer, Central Circle VI, Delhi, went to Sahibganj and examined the accounts there in the case of the petitioner No. 1 and when the assessee voluntarily requested the Income tax Officer to have 271 the examination done at Delhi (the assessee had then come to Delhi for some other work of his) the Income tax Officer promptly posted the case and examined the accounts.\r\nIf these were the circumstances under which the cases of the petitioners were transferred from Patna to Calcutta and from Calcutta to Delhi and the petitioners were afforded all conveniences in the matter of the examination of their accounts and evidence, there is no basis for the charge that the orders of transfer made against these petitioners were in any manner whatever discriminatory.\r\nPetitions Nos. 44 and 85 of 1956 The petitioner in Petition No. 44\/56 is Shri A. L. Sud who originally belonged to Hoshiarpur district in Punjab and since 1948 resides and has his office in Calcutta.\r\nBhagwan Das Sud as the karta thereof.\r\nThis Hindu undivided family has been carrying on business at Hoshiarpur and at various other places like Bareilly, Calcutta and Bombay.\r\nThe said joint family of Bhagwan Das Sud & Sons was alleged to have evaded income tax to a large extent and had inter related transactions in respect of their dealings, the petitioner being a copartner of the said joint family.\r\nIt was, therefore, considered necessary in order to have a proper assessment of the petitioner 's income that his case also should be dealt with by the Income tax Officer assessing the joint family and the petitioner was informed that, in the matter of hearing, he would be put to least inconvenience.\r\nThese were the circumstances under which his case was transferred from the Income tax Officer, Survey Circle, Calcutta, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, by an order of the Central Board of Revenue dated June 29, 1955.\r\nThe case of M\/S. Bhagwan Das Sud & Sons, petitioners in Petition No. 85\/56; had already been 272 transferred by the Commissioner of Income tax from the Income tax Officer, Hoshiarpur, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, by an order under section 5(7A) of the Act dated October 20, 1953.\r\nThe petitioners had their office at Hoshiarpur in Punjab but their activities were scattered in various parts of India some of them being in Assam, Bombay, Bareilly, Calcutta and Kanpur in respect of the contracts they undertook with the Government and other parties.\r\nThey were alleged to have concealed income assessable to income tax exceeding Rs. 30 lakhs and it was thought necessary to make proper investigation of their widespread activities resulting ' in extensive evasion of income tax.\r\nThese were the circumstances under which their case was transferred to the Incometax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, as above.\r\nThat officer, however, agreed to examine the accounts and evidence at Hoshiarpur itself to suit the convenience of the petitioners but the petitioners did not agree on the ground that their Advocate was to come from Delhi and therefore Ambala would suit them as well.\r\nThe cases of both the petitioners thus came to be transferred from the respective Income tax Officers who used to assess them at Calcutta and Hoshiarpur respectively to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, and all conveniences were afforded to them in the matter of the examination of their accounts and evidence.\r\nThe argument of discrimination and inconvenience and harassment thus loses all its force and the orders of transfer made against them cannot be challenged as in any way discriminatory.\r\nIt may be noted that in the last mentioned four petitions, viz., Petitions Nos. 97 & 97 A of 1956 and Petitions Nos.\r\n44\/56 and 85\/56, the Central Board of Revenue or the Commissioner of Income tax, as the case may be, instructed the Income tax Officers concerned to minimise the inconvenience caused to the assessees and even proceed to their respective residences or places of business in order to examine the accounts and evidence.\r\nInspite of the denials of the assessees in the affidavits which they filed in 273 rejoinder, we presume that such facilities will continue to be afforded to them in the future and the inconvenience and harassment which would otherwise be caused to them will be avoided.\r\nA humane and considerate administration of the relevant provisions of the Income tax Act would go a long way in allaying the apprehensions of the assessees and if that is done in the true spirit, no assessee will be in a position to charge the Revenue with administering the provisions of the Act with \" an evil eye and unequal hand \".\r\nWe have, therefore, come to the conclusion that there is no substance in these petitions and they should be dismissed with costs.\r\nThere will, be, however, one set of costs between respondents in each of the petitions and one set of costs in each group of these petitions, viz., (1) Petitions Nos.97 & 97 A of 1956, (2) Petitions Nos.44\/56 and 85\/56, (3) Petitions Nos. 86\/56, 87\/56, 88\/56, 111\/56, 112\/56 and 158\/56, (4) Petitions Nos.211 to 215 of 1956, and (5) Petitions Nos. 225 to 229 of 1956.",

Ghose, for the State of West Bengal (Respondents Nos. 2 and 3 in Petitions Nos.211 to 215 of 1956).\r\nDecember 21.\r\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.\r\nThese petitions under article 32 of the Constitution raise a common question of law whether section 5 (7A) of the Indian Income tax Act, hereinafter 236 called the Act, is ultra vires the Constitution as infringing the fundamental rights enshrined in article 14 and article 19 (1) (g).\r\nThe facts which led to the filing of the petitions 'nay be shortly stated.\r\npetitions Nos.\r\n97 & 97 A of 1956: The petitioners are M\/s. pannalal Binjrai, Oilmill owners, merchants and commission agents, carrying on business at Sahibganj in the district of Santhal Pargans, having their branch at 94 Lower Chitpur Road, Culcutta, petitioner No. 1, and R. B. Jamuna Das Chowdhury, resident of the same place and erstwhile karta of the Hindu undivided family, which carried on business in the name and style of M\/S. Pannalal Binjr petetioner No. 2.\r\nBefore September 28, 1954, they, being assessed by the Income tax officer, Special Circle, Patna.\r\nOn September 28, 1954, the Central Board of Revenue made an order transferring their cases to the Income.tax Officer, Central Circle XI, Calcutta.\r\nOn January 22, 1955, the Central Board of Revenue transferred the cases of petitioner No. 2 to the Income tax Officer Central Circle VI,Delhi, and on July 12, 1955, it similarly transferred the cases of petitioner No. I to the same officer.\r\nPrior to June 29, 1959, he had been assessed to income tax by the Income tax Officer, Special Survey Circle VII, Calcutta.\r\nOn June 29, 1955, the Central Board of Revenue transferred his case to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala,, and the said officer continued the proceedings in the transferred case and also instituted further proceedings against the petitioner and assessed him under section 23 (4) of the Act for the assessment years 1946 47 and 1947 48.\r\nDemands were made upon the petitioner for payment of the amount of income tax thus assessed whereupon he filed this petition impeaching the validity of the order of the Central Board 'of Revenue dated June 29, 1955, and the proceedings entertained by the Income tax Officer, Special ' Circle, Ambala,on the ground that section 5 (7A) of the Act was ultra vires the Constitution.\r\nBefore October 20, 1953, they were being assessed by the Income tax Officer,, Hoshiarpur, but on that date their case was transferred under section 5 (7A) of the Act by the Commissioner of Income tax to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala.\r\nThe said officer continued the said case and reopened the assessment for the years 1944 45 to 1050 51 and completed the assessment for the assessment, years 1947 48, 1950 51 and 1951 52.\r\nThese petitioners also thereupon filed the petition challenging the validity of the order of transfer made by the Commissioner of Income tax on October 20, 1953, and the proceedings entertained by the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, thereafter, on the same ground of the ultra vires character of section 5 (7A) of the Act.\r\nof M\/s bhagwan Das Sud & Sons and the cases of both these petitionrs were transferred to the Income tax Officer, Special 238 Circle, Ambala, as above, by the said respective orders.\r\nPetitions Nos. 86, 87, 88, 111, 112 and 158 of 1956: These petitions may be compendiously described as the Amritsar group.\r\nThe petitioner in Petition No. 86\/56 is Sardar Gurdial Singh, son of section Narain Singh.\r\nThe petitioner in Petition No. 87\/56 is Dr. Sarmukh Singh, son of section Narain Singh.\r\nThe petitioner in Petition No. 112156 is section Ram Singh, soil of section Narain Singh.\r\nThese three are brothers and the petitioner in Petition No. 88\/56 is the father, section Narain Singh, son of section Basdev Singh.\r\nThe father and the three sons were the directors in the Hindustan Embroidery Mills (Private) Ltd., petitioner No. 1 in Petition No. 111\/56, which is located at Chheharta near Amritsar.\r\nAll these petitioners were, prior to the orders of transfer made by the Commissioner of Income tax under section 5(7A) of the Act, being assessed by the Income tax Officer, 'A ' Ward, Amritsar, but their cases were transferred on or about June 29, 1953, from the Income tax Officer, 'A ' Ward, Amritsar, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Amritsar.\r\nThese cases were continued by the latter officer and notices under a. 34 of the Act were also issued by him against them for the assessment years 1947 48 to ' 1951 52.\r\nEach one of them filed a separate petition challenging the said orders of transfer by the Commissioner of Income tax and the proceedings entertained by the Income tax Office r, Special Circle, Amritsar, against them on the score of the unconstitutionality of section 5 (7A) of the Act.\r\nThe petitioner in Petition No. 158\/56 is one Shri Ram Saran Das Kapur, the head and karta of the Hindu undivided family carrying on business outside Ghee Mandi Gate, Amritsar.\r\nHis case also whichprior to the order complained against, was being entertained by the Income tax Officer, 'F ' Ward, Amritsar, was transferred on some date in 1954 by an order of the Commissioner of Income tax under section 5(7A) of the Act to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Amritsar.\r\nNo objection wag taken by the 239 petitioner to this order of transfer until after the assess.\r\nment order was passed against him but he also challenged the validity of the said order of transfer and the proceedings entertained by the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Amritsar, thereafter, on the same grounds as the other petitioners.\r\nPetitions NOs.211 to 215 of 1956: These petitions may be described as the Sriram Jhabarmull group.\r\nThough ' separately filed, the petitioner in each of them is the same individuals Nandram Agarwalla, who is the sole proprietor Of a business which he carries on under the name and style of I Sriram Jhabarmull '.\r\nIt is a business, inter alia, of import and export of piece goods ' as commission agents, and dealers in raw wool and other materials.\r\nThe principal place of business is at Kalimpong, in the district of Darjeeling, though there is also a branch at Calcutta.\r\nPrior to the orders of the Commissioner of Income tax under section 5(7A) of the Act complained against, the petitioner was being assessed by the Income tax Officer, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling.\r\nOn June 8, 1946, there was a further transfer assigning the cases to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle 1, Calcutta, and on July 27, 1946, orders were passed by the Commissioner of Income tax Central, Calcutta, under section 5(7A) transferring the cases of the petitioner to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta.\r\nThese are the orders which are complained against as unconstitutional and void invalidating the proceedings which were continued and subsequently instituted by the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta, against the petitioner on the score of the unconstitutionality of section 5(7A) of the Act.\r\nIt may be noted, however that these orders were all prior to the Constitution and 240 having been made on July 27, 1946, as aforesaid were followed up by completed assessment proceedings in respect of the said respective years and also certificate proceedings under section 46(2) of the Act.\r\nThere were further orders dated December 15, 1947, and sometime in September, 1948, transferring the cases of the petitioner from the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta, to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle 1, Calcutta, and back from him to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle,IV Calcutta.\r\ndated July 27, 1946, which was passed under section 5(7A) of the Act.\r\nPetitions Nos.\r\n225 to 229 of 1956: These Petitions may be classed as the Raichur group.\r\nThey concern the assessment for the respective assessment years 1950 5l, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55.\r\nThe petitioner in each of them is the same individual, one Kalloor Siddannal who resides and carries on business in Raichur in the State of Hyderabad as commission agent and distributor of agricultural products.\r\nIncome tax was first imposed in the Hyderabad State in 1946 by a special Act of the Legislature and the petitioner was assessed under the Hyderabad Income tax Act by the Additional Income tax Officer, Raichur, for the assessment years 1948 49 and 1949 50.\r\nAs from April 1, 195o, the Indian Income tax Act was applied to Hyderabad but the Additional Income tax Officer, Raichur, continued to assess the petitioner.\r\nThe cases in respect of the assessment years 1950 51, 1951 52 and 1952 53 were pending before that officer and proceedings were taken in connection with the assessment for those years.\r\nOn December 21, 1953, however, the Commissioner of Income tax Hyderabad, issued a notification under section 5(7) ordering that the case of the petitioner should be transferred from the Additional income tax Officer, Raichur, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Hyderabad.\r\nThe latter officer continued the assessment proceedings and issued notices under section 22(.4) of the Act on July 1, 1954, November 2, 1954, November 30,1954, 241 December 19, 1954, and March 11, 1955, in respect of the said years of assessment.\r\nAssessments for the said years were made on March 21, 1955, and on April 24, 1955, the petitioner made an application under section 27 of the Act to reopen the assessment for the year 1950 51 as on default under section 23 (4) of the Act.\r\nIt appears, however, that shortly before May 19, 1955, the Commissioner of Income tax, Hyderabad, made another order under section 5 (7A) and section 64 (5)(b) of the Act transferring all the cases of the petitioner to the main Income tax Officer, Raichur.\r\nCuriously enough, the petitioner challenged both the orders one dated December 21, 1953, and the other made sometime in May, 1955, under section 5 (7A) of the Act and the proceedings continued and instituted by the respective officers thereunder as unconstitutional and void on the ground that section 5 (7A) was ultra vires the Constitution even though ultimately he was being assessed by the main Income tax Officer, Raichur, under the latter order.\r\nThis is the common question in regard to the ultra vires character of section 5 (7A) of the Act which is raised in all these petitions, though in regard to each group there are several questions of fact involving the consideration of the discriminatory character of the specific orders passed therein which we shall deal with hereafter in their appropriate places.\r\nSection 5 (7A) of the Act runs as under: \" 5 (7A) : The Commissioner of Income tax may transfer any ease from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another, and the Central Board of Revenue may transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nSuch transfer may be made at any 'stage of the proceedings, and shall not render necessary the reissue of any notice already issued by the Income tax Officer from whom the case is transferred.\r\n\" This sub section was inserted by section 3 of the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1940 (XL of 1940) which was passed as a result of the decision of the Bombay High Court in Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner of Income tax, (Central) (1) I.L.R. , 31 242 By the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1956 (XXVI of 1956) an explanation was added to section 5(7A) in the terms following as a result of the decision of this Court in Bidi Supply Co. v The Union of India(1): \" Explanation : In this sub section, I case ' in relation to any person whose name is specified in the order of transfer means all proceedings under this Act in respect of any year which may be pending on the date of the transfer,, and includes all proceedings under this Act which may be commenced after the date of the transfer in respect of any year.\r\n\" Section 5(7A) together with the explanation thus falls to be considered by us in these petitions.\r\nThe argument on behalf of the petitioners is that a. 64, sub sections(1) and (2) of the Act confer upon the assessee a valuable right and he is entitled to tell the taxing authorities that he shall not be called upon to attend at different places and thus upset his business.\r\nSection 5(7A) invests the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue with naked and arbitrary power to transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another without any limitation in point of time, a power which is unguided and uncontrolled and is discriminatory in its nature and it is open to the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue to pick out the case of one assessee from those of others in a like situation and transfer the same from one State to another or from one end of India to the other without 'specifying any object and without giving any reason, thus subjecting the particular assessee to discriminatory treatment whereas the other assessees similarly situated with him would continue to be assessed at the places where they reside or carry on business under section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act.\r\nThe discrimination involved in section 5(7A) is substantial in character and, therefore, infringes the fundamental right enshrined,in article 14 of the Constitution.\r\nIt also infringes article 19 (1) (g) in so far as it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or business (Vide Himmatlal Harilal Mehta vs The State of Madhya Pradesh(1)).\r\nThe very same question as regards the unconstitutionality of section 5(7A) of the Act had come up for decision before this Court in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India (supra).\r\nThe case of the assessee there had been transferred by the Central Board of Revenue under section 5(7A) of the get from the Income tax Officer, District 111, Calcutta, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ranchi.\r\nThe order was an omnibus wholesale order of transfer expressed in general terms without any reference to any particular case and with out any limitation as to time and was challenged as void on the ground that section 5(7A) under which it had been passed was unconstitutional.\r\nThis Court, by a majority judgment, after discussing the general principles underlying article 14, did not adjudicate upon that question, observing at p. 276: \"We do not consider it necessary, for the purpose of this case, to pause to consider whether the constitutionality of Sub section.(7A) of section 5 can be Supported on the principle of any reasonable classification laid down by this Court or whether the Act lays down any principle for guiding or regulating the exercise of discretion by the Commissioner or Board of Revenue or whether the sub section confers an unguided and arbitrary power on those authorities to pick and choose individual assessee and place that assessee at a disadvantage in comparison with other assessees.\r\nAll assessees are entitled to the benefit of those provisions except where a particular case or cases of a particular assessee for a particular year or years is or are transferred under sub section (7A) of section 5, assuming that section to be valid and if a particular case or cases is or are transferred his right under section 64 still remains as regards his other case or cases.\r\n\" The majority judgment then proceeded to consider the effect of such an omnibus order unlimited in point of time on the rights of the assessee and further observed in that context at p. 277: \" This order is calculated to inflict considerable inconvenience and harassment on the petitioner.\r\nIts books of account will have to be produced before the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ranchi a place hundreds of miles from Calcutta, which is its place of business.\r\nThere may be no suitable place where they can put up during that period.\r\nThere will certainly be extra expenditure to be incurred by it by way of railway fare, freight and hotel expenses.\r\nTherefore the reality of the discrimination cannot be gainsaid.\r\nIn the circumstances this substantial discrimination has been inflicted on the petitioner by an executive fiat which is not founded on any law and no question of reasonable classification for purposes of legislation can arise.\r\nHere \"the State\" which includes its Income tax department has by an illegal order denied to the petitioner, as compared with other Bidi mer chants who are similarly situate, equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws and the petitioner can legitimately complain of an infraction of his fundamental right under Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n\" The question as to the constitutionality of section 5 (7A) of the Act was thus left open and the decision turned merely on the construction of the impugned order.\r\n245 Learned counsel for the petitioners, however, lays particular stress on the observations of Bose, J., in the minority judgment which he delivered in that case whereby he held that sections 5 (7A) and 64 (5) (b) of the Act were themselves ultra vires article 14 of the Constitution and not merely the order of the Central Board of Revenue.\r\nThe learned Judge referred to a passage from the judgment of Fazl Ali, J., in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar(1) and also pointed out the decision of this Court in M\/S. Dwarka Prasad Laxmi Narain vs The State of Uttar Pradesh and Two Others(2) and observed: \" What is the position here? There is no hearing, no reasons are recorded: just peremptory orders transferring the case from one place to another without any warning; and the power given by the Act is to transfer from one end of India to the other; nor is that power unused.\r\nWe have before us in this Court a case pending in which a transfer has been ordered from Calcutta in West Bengal to Ambala in the Punjab.\" (p. 283) \"\r\nIf the Legislature itself had done here what the Central Board of Revenue has done and had passed an Act in the bald terms of the order made here transferring the case of this petitioner, picked out from others in a like situation, from one State to another, or from one end of India to the other, without specifying any object and without giving any reason, it would, in my judgment, have been bad.\r\nI am unable to see how the position is bettered because the Central Board of Revenue has done this and not Parliament.\" (p. 284 5) \"\r\nIn my opinion, the power of transfer can only be conferred if it is hedged round with reasonable restrictions, the absence or existence of which can in the last instance be determined by the courts; and the exercise of the power must be in conformity with the rules of natural justice, that is to say, the parties affected must be heard when that is reasonably possible, and the reasons for the order must be reduced, however briefly, to writing so that men may know that (1) ; , 309 310.`(2) ; 246 the powers conferred on these quasi judicial bodies are being justly and properly exercised.\" (p. 287)\r\nThe answer furnished on behalf of the State to this argument is fourfold: (i)that the provision contained in section 5 (7A) of the Act is a measure of administrative convenience enacted with a view to more conveniently and effectively deal with the cases of the assessees where the Commissioner of Income tax considers it necessary or desirable to transfer any case from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another or the Central Board of Revenue similarly considers it necessary or desirable to transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nThe real object with which section 5 (7A) was inserted by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1940 (XL of 1940), has been thus set out in the affidavit of Shri V. Gouri Shankar, Under Secretary, Central Board of Revenue, dated November 19, 1956, which is the pattern of all the affidavits filed on behalf of the State in these petitions: \" 4.\r\nI say that the provisions of section 5 (7A) were inserted by the Income tax Amendment Act, XL of 1940, with the object of minimising certain procedural difficulties.\r\nBefore this amendment was passed there was no specific provision in the Act for transferring a case from one Income tax Officer to another except by a long and circuitous course even at the request of the assessees.\r\nIn order therefore to be able to transfer the case from one 1.\r\nto another either because of the request of the assessee or for dealing with cases involving special features such as cases of assessees involving widespread activities and large ramifications or inter related transactions, power to transfer cases was conferred upon the Central Board of Revenue and the Commissioner of Income tax as the case may be.\r\nI say that the provisions of section 5 (7A) ate thus administrative in character. . (ii)that the assessee whose case is thus transferred is not subjected to any discriminatory procedure in the matter of his assessment.\r\nThe Income tax Officer to whom his case is transferred deals with it under the same procedure which is laid down in the relevant 247 provisions of the Act.\r\nThe decision of the Income tax Officer is subject to appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the assessee has the further right to appeal to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal and to approach the High Court and ultimately the Supreme Court, as provided in the Act.\r\nAll assessees, whether they are assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area where they reside or carry on business or their cases are transferred from one Income tax Officer to another, are subject to the same procedure and are entitled to the same rights and privileges in the matter of redress of their grievances, if any, and there is no dis crimination whatever between assessees and assessees; (iii)that the right, if any, conferred upon the assessee under section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act is not an absolute right but is circumscribed by the exigencies of tax collection and can be negatived as it has been in cases where the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, think it necessary or desirable to transfer his case from one Income tax Officer to another under section 5 (7A) of the Act having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\r\nThe argument of inconvenience is thus sought to be met in the same affidavit: \" 5. 1 further say that as a result of any transfer that may be made under the provisions of section 5 (7A) there is no discriminatory treatment with regard to the procedure and that no privileges and rights which are given to the assessees by the Income tax Act are taken away nor is the assessee exposed to any increased prejudice, punitary consequences or differential treatment.\r\nI say that in cases where transfers under this section are made otherwise than on request from assessees, the convenience of the assessees is taken into consideration by placing the case in the hands of an Income tax Officer who is nearest to the area where it will be convenient for the assessee to attend.\r\nIf on account of administrative exigencies this is not possible and the assessee requests that the examination of accounts or evidence to be taken should be in a place convenient to him, the I.T.O. complies with the request 248 of the assessee and holds the hearing at the place requested.\r\n\" Even if there be a difference between assessees who reside or carry on business in a particular area by reason of such transfers the difference is not material.\r\nIt is only a minor deviation from a general standard and does not amount to a denial of equal rights; (iv)that the power which is thus vested is a discretionary power and is not necessarily discriminatory in its nature and that abuse of power is not to be easily assumed where discretion is vested in such high officials of the State.\r\nEven if abuse of power may sometimes occur, the validity of the provision cannot be contested because of such apprehension.\r\nWhat may be struck down in such cases is not the provision itself but the discriminatory application thereof.\r\nThe petitioners rejoin by relying upon the following passage from the judgment of Fazl Ali, J., in The State Of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar, (Supra), which was referred to by Bose, J., in his minority judgment in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (Supra), at page 281: \" It was suggested that the reply to this query is that the Act itself being general and applicable to all persons and to all offenses, cannot be Said to discriminate in favour of or against any particular case or classes of persons or cases, and if any charge of discrimination can be leveled at all, it can be levelled only against the act of the executive authority if the Act is misused.\r\nThis kind of argument however does not appear to me to solve the difficulty.\r\nThe result of accepting it would be that even where discrimination is quite evident one cannot challenge the Act simply because it Is couched in general terms; and one cannot also challenge the act of the executive authority whose duty it is to administer the Act, because that authority will say: I am not to blame as I am acting under the Act.\r\nIt is clear that if the argument were to be ,accepted, article 14 could be easily defeated.\r\nI think the fallacy of the argument lies in overlooking the fact that the I insidious discrimination complained of is incorporated in the Act itself ', it being so drafted 249 that whenever any discrimination is made such discrimination would be ultimately traceable to it.\r\nThe pivot of the whole argument of the petitioners is the provisions contained in section 64(1) and (2) of the Act which prescribe the place of assessment.\r\nThey are: \" 64.\r\n(1) Where an assessee carries on a business, profession or vocation at any place, he shall be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area in which that place is situate or, where the business, profession or vocation is carried on in more places than one, by the Income tax Officer of the area in which the principal place of his business, profession or vocation is situate.\r\n(2)In all other cases, an assessee shall be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area in which he resides.\r\n\" These provisions were construed by the Bombay High Court in Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner Income tax, (Central), (supra), and Beaumont, C.J., observed at p. 657: \" In my opinion section 64 was intended to ensure that as far as practicable an assessee should be assessed locally, and the area to which an Income tax Officer is appointed must, so far as the 'exigencies of tax collection allow, bear some reasonable relation to the place where the assessee carries on business or resides.\" Kania, J., as he then was, went a step further and stated at p. 660: \"A plain reading of the section shows that the same is imperative in terms.\r\nIt also gives to the assessee a valuable right.\r\nHe is entitled to tell the taxing authorities that he shall not be called upon to attend at different places and thus upset his business.\r\n\" The learned Judges there appear to have treated the provisions of section 64(1) and (2) more as a question of right than as a matter of convenience only.\r\nIf there were thus a right conferred upon the assessee by the provisions of section 64(1) and (2) of the Act and that right continues to be enjoyed.\r\nby all the assessees except the 32 250 assessee whose case is transferred under section 5(7A) of the Act to another Income tax Officer outside the area where he resides or carries on business, the assessee can urge that, as compared with those other assessees, he is discriminated against and is subjected to inconvenience and harassment.\r\nIt is, therefore, necessary to consider whether any such right is conferred upon the assessee by section 64(1) and (2) of the Act.\r\nPrima facie it would appear that an assessee is entitled under those provisions to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the particular area where he ,resides or carries on business.\r\nEven where a question arises as to the place of assessment such question is under section 64(3) to be determined by the Commissioner or the Commissioners concerned if the question is between places in more States than one or by the Central Board of Revenue if the latter are, not in agreement and the assessee is given an opportunity of representing his views before any such question is determined.\r\nThis provision also goes to show that the convenience of the assessee is the main consideration in determining the place of assessment.\r\nEven so the exigencies of tax collection have got to be considered and the primary object of the Act, viz., the assessment of income tax, has got to be achieved.\r\nThe hierarchy of income tax authorities which is set up under Chapter 11 of the Act has been so set up with a view to assess the proper income tax payable by the assessee and whether the one or the other of the authorities will proceed to assess a particular assessee has got to be determined not only having regard to the convenience of the assessee but also the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nIn order to assess the tax payable by an assessee more conveniently and efficiently it may be necessary to have him assessed by an Income tax Officer of an area other than the one in which, he resides or carries on business.\r\nIt may be that the nature and volume of his business operations are such as require investigation into his affairs in a place other than the one where he resides or carries on business or that he is so, connected with various other individuals or organiza tions in the way of his earning his income as to render 251 such extra tertitorial investigation necessary: before he may be properly assessed.\r\nThese are but instances of the various situations which may arise wherein it may be thought necessary by the Income tax authorities to transfer his case from the Income tax, Officer of the area in which he resides or carries on business to, another Income tax Officer whether functioning in the same State or beyond it.\r\nThis aspect of the question wag emphasized by Beaumont, C.J., in Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner of Income tax, (Central), (supra), at page 146, when he used the expression \" as far as practicable \" in connection with the assessee 's right to be assessed locally and the expression \" so far as exigencies of tax collection allow \" in connection with the appointment of the Income tax Officer to assess the tax payable by the particular assessee.\r\nIn the later case of Dayaldas Kushiram vs Commissioner of Income tax, (Central)(1), Beaumont, C.J., expressed himself as follows: \" The Income tax Act does not determine the place of assessment.\r\nWhat it does is to determine the Officer who is to have power to assess and in some cases it does so by reference to locality but I apprehend that an appeal would be not against an order of the Commissioner as to the place of assessment, but against the order of assessment of the Income tax, Officer,\" thus stating in effect that this section does not give a right to the assessee to have his assessment, at a parti cular place but determines the Income tax Officer who is to have power to assess him.\r\nThis aspect was further emphasized by the Federal Court in Wallace Brothers & Co. vs Commissioner of, Income tax, Bombay, Sind & Baluchistan (2), where Spens, C.J., observed: Clause (3) of section 64 provides that any question as to the place of assessment shall be determined ' by the Commissioner or by the Central Board of Revenue Proviso 3 to the clause enacts that if the place of assessment is called in question by the assessee, the Income tax Officer shall, if not satisfied, with the (1) , 101.(2) A.I.R. 1945 F.C. 9,13.252 correctness of the claim, refer the matter for determination under this sub section before assessment is made.\r\nThese provisions clearly indicate that the matter is more one of administrative convenience than of jurisdiction and that in any event it is not one for adjudication by the Court.\r\n\" It may be noted, however, that in the passage at page 276 of the majority judgment in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India (supra), this court regarded the benefit conferred on the assessee by these provisions of a. 64(1) and (2) of the Act as a right and it is, too late in the day for us to say that no such right to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the particular area, where he resides or carries on his business is conferred on the assessee.\r\nThis right, however, according to the authorities above referred to, is hedged in with the limitation that it has to yield to the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nThe position, therefore, is that the determination of the, question whether a particular Income tax Officer should assess the case of the assessee depends on (1) the convenience of the assessee as posited in section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act, and (2) the exigencies of tax collection and it would be open to the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue who are the highest amongst the Income tax.\r\nAuthorities under the Act to transfer the case of a particular assessee from the Income tax Officer of the area within which he resides or carries on business to any other Income tax Officer if the exigencies of tax collection warrant the same.\r\nIt is further to be noted that the infringement of such a right by the order of transfer, under section 5 (7A) of the Act is not a material infringement.\r\nIt is only a deviation of a minor character from the general standard and does not necessarily involve a denial of equal rights for the simple reason that even after such transfer the case is dealt with under the normal procedure which is prescribed in the Act.\r\nThe production and investigation of the books of account, the enquiries to be made by the Income tax Officer and the whole of the procedure as to assessment including the further 253 appeals after the assessment is made by the Incometax Officer are the same in a transferred case as in others which remain with the Income tax Officer of the area in which the other assesees reside or carry on business.\r\nThere is thus no differential treatment and no scope for the argument that the particular assessee is discriminated against with reference to others similarly situated.\r\nIt was observed by this Court in, M. K. Gopalan vs The State of Madhya Pradesh(1): \" In support of the objection raised under article 14 of the Constitution, reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in Anwar Ali Sarkar 's case.\r\nIn the pre ' sent case, the Special Magistrate under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code has to try the case entirely under the normal procedure, and 'no discrimination of the kind contemplated by the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar 'd case and the other cases following it arises here.\r\nA law vesting discretion in an authority under such circumstances cannot be said to be discriminatory as such, and is therefore not hit by article 14 of the Constitution.\r\nThere is, therefore, no substance in this contention.\"\r\nTo a similar effect were the observations of Mukherjea, J., as he then was, in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar, (supra), at p. 325: \"I agree with the Attorney General that if the differences are not material, there may not be any discrimination in the proper sense of the word and minor deviations from the general standard might not amount to denial of equal rights deemed never at any time to have applied to an assessee where, in consequence of any transfer made under section 5 (7A), a particular Income tax Officer has been charged with the function of assessing that assessee.\r\nsection 64 (5) was incorporated by the Income tax Law Amendment Act, 1940 (XL of 1940) simultaneously with section 5 (7A).\r\nIt is ' therefore, urged that an assesse whose case has been thus transferred has no right under section 64 (1) and (2) and those assessees alone who do not come within the purview of section 64 (5) can have the benefit of section 64 (1) and (2).\r\nThis argument, however, ignores the fact that section 5 (7A) is the very basis of the enactment of the relevant provision in section 64 (5) and if a. 5 (7A) cannot stand by virtue of its being discriminatory in character, the relevant portion of section 64 (5) also must fall with it.\r\nIt is then contended that a. 5 (7A) is in itself discriminatory and violative of the fundamental right en shrined in article 14.\r\nThe power which is vested in the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue is a naked and arbitrary power unguided and uncontrolled by any rules.\r\nNo rules have been framed and no directions given which would regulate or guide their discretion or on the basis of which such transfers can be made and the whole matter is left to the unrestrained will of the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue without there being anything which could ensure a proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon the injustice that might result from the improper execution of the same.\r\nTo use the words of Mr. Justice Matthews in the case of Yick Wo vs Hopkins(1): \". when we remember that this action or nonaction may proceed from enmity or prejudice, from partisan zeal or animosity, from favoritism and other improper influences and motives easy of concealment and difficult to be detected and exposed, it becomes unnecessary to suggest or comment upon the injustice capable of being wrought under cover of such a power, for that becomes apparent to every one who gives to the subject a moment 's consideration.\" , 373; , 227.255\r\nIn other words, \" it is not a question of an uncon stitutional administration of a statute otherwise valid on its face but here the unconstitutionality is writ large on the face of the statute itself \" (Per Das, J., as he then was, in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali, Sarkar, (supra) at p. 346).\r\nIt has to be remembered that the purpose of the Act is to levy income tax, assess and collect the same.\r\nThe preamble of the Act does not say so in terms it being an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to income tax and super tax but that is the purpose of the Act as disclosed in the preamble of the First Indian Income tax Act of 1886 (Act II of 1886).\r\nIt follows, therefore, that all the provisions contained in the Act have been designed with the object of achieving that purpose.\r\nThere is in the first instance, the charge of income tax.\r\nThen we find set up the various authorities in the hierarchy who are entrusted with the function of assessing the income tax, the Central Board of Revenue being at the apex.\r\nThere is also an Appellate Tribunal which is established for hearing appeals against the decisions of the Appellate Assistant Commissioners.\r\nThen follow the provisions in regard to taxable income, mode of assessment and cognate provisions.\r\nThe Income tax Officers are invested with the duty ' of assessing the income tax of the assessees in the first instance.\r\nThe Assistant Commissioners of Income tax, are the appellate authorities over the decisions of the Income tax Officers and the Income tax Appellate Tribunal is the final appellate authority barring of course references under section 66(1) of the Act to the High Court on questions of law.\r\nThe Commissioners of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue are mainly administrative authorities over the Income tax Officers and the Assistant Commissioners of Income tax and they are to distribute and control the work to be done by these authorities.\r\nAll officers and persons employed in the execution of the Act are to observe and follow the orders instructions and directions of the.\r\nCentral Board of Revenue which is the highest authority in the hierarchy and, even though normally in accordance 256 with the provisions of section 64 (1) and (2) the work of assessment is to be done by the Income tax Officers of the area within which the assessees reside or carry on business, power is given by section 5(7A) to the Commissioner of Income tax to transfer any case from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another and to the Central Board of Revenue to transfer any case from any one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nThis is the administrative machinery which is set up for assessing the incomes of the assessees which are chargeable to income tax.\r\nThere is, therefore, considerable force in the contention which has been urged on behalf of the State that section 5(7A) is a provision for administrative convenience.\r\nNevertheless this power which is given to the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue has to be exercised in a manner which is not discriminatory.\r\nNo rules or directions having been laid down in regard to the exercise of that power in particular cases, the appropriate authority has to determine what are the proper cases in which such power should be exercised having regard to the object of the Act and the ends to be achieved.\r\nThe cases of the assessees which come for assessment before the income tax authorities are of various types and no one case is similar to another.\r\nthere are complications introduced by the very nature of the business which is carried on by the assessees and there may be, in particular cases, such widespread activities and large ramifications or inter related transactions as might require for the convenient and efficient assessment of income tax the transfer of such cases from one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nIn such cases the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, has to exercise its discretion with due regard to the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nEven though there may be a common attribute between the assesses whose case is thus transferred and the assessees; who continue to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area within which they reside or carry on business, the other attributes would not be common.\r\nOne assessee may 257 have such widespread activities and ramifications as would require his case to be transferred from the Income tax Officer of the particular area to an Income tax Officer of another area in the same State or in another State, which may be called \" X \".\r\nAnother assessee, though belonging to a similar category may be more conveniently and efficiently assessed in another area whether situated within the State or without it, called \" Y \".\r\nThe considerations which will weigh with the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue in transferring the cases of such assessee either to the area \" X \" or the area \" Y \" will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule can be laid down for determining whether the particular case should , be transferred at 'all or to an Income tax Officer of a particular area.\r\nSuch discretion would necessarily have to be vested in the authority concerned and merely because the case of a particular assessee is transferred from the Income tax Officer of an area within which he resides or carries on business to another Income tax Officer whether wit in or without the State will not by itself be sufficient to characterize the exercise of the discretion as discriminatory.\r\nEven if there is a possibility of discriminatory treatment of persons falling within the same group or category, such possibility cannot necessarily invalidate the piece of legislation.\r\nIt may also be remembered that this power is vested not in minor officials but in top ranking authorities like the Commissioner of Income tax and the Central Board of Revenue who act on the information supplied to them by the Income tax Officers concerned.\r\nThis power is discretionary and not necessarily discriminatory and abuse of power cannot be easily assumed where the discretion is vested in such high officials.\r\n(Vide Matajog Dobey vs H. section Bhari(1)).\r\nThere is moreover a presumption that public officials will discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law.\r\n(Vide People of the State of (1) ; , 932.33 258 New York vs John E. Van De Carr, etc.(1)\r\nIt has also been observed by this Court in A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar vs M. Venkitachalam Potti(2) with reference to the possibility of discrimination between assessees in the matter of the reference of their cases to the Income tax Investigation Commission that \" It is to be presumed, unless the, contrary were shown, that the 'administration of a particular law would be done I not with an evil eye and unequal hand ' and the selection made by the Government of the cases of persons to be referred for investigation by the Commission would not be discriminatory.\" This presumption, however, cannot be stretched too far and cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reason for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile and discriminatory treatment (Vide Gulf, Colorado, etc.\r\nvs W. H. Ellis (3)).\r\nThere may be cases where improper execution of power will result in injustice to the parties.\r\nIt is pointed that it will be next to impossible for the assessee to challenge a particular order made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, as discriminatory because the reasons.\r\nwhich actuated the authority in making the order will be known to itself not being recorded in the body of the order itself or communicated to the assesse.\r\nThis apprehension is, however, ill founded.\r\nThough the (1) ; (1905) 310 199 U.S. 552; (2) (1955)2 section C. R. 1196.\r\n(3) ; ; 41 L.Ed. 666.\r\n(4) [1955] I S.C.R. 140.\r\n259 burden of proving that there is an abuse of power,lies on the assessee who challenges the order as discriminatory, such burden is not by way of proof to the hilt.\r\nThere are instances where in the case of an accused person rebutting a presumption or proving an.\r\nexception which will exonerate him from the liability for the offence with which he has been charged, the burden is held to be discharged by evidence satisfying the jury of the probability of that which the accused is called upon to establish (Vide Rex vs Carr Briant (1)), or in the case of a detenue under the Preventive Detention Act seeking to make out a case of want of bona fides in the detaining authority, the burden of proof is held not to be one which requires proof to the hilt but such as will render the absence of bona fides reasonably probable (Vide Ratanlal Gupta vs The District Magistrat of Ganjam also Brundaban Chandra Dhir Narendra vs The State of Orissa (Revenue Department) (3)).\r\nIf, in a particular ,case, the assessee seeks to impeach the order of transfer is an abuse of power pointing out circumstances which prima facie and without anything more would make out the exercise of the power discriminatory qua him, it will be incumbent on the authority to explain the circumstances under which the order has been made.\r\nThe court will, in that event, scrutinize these Circumstances having particular regard to the object sought to be achieved by the enactment of section 5(7A) of the Act as set out in para 4 of the affidavit of Shri V. Gouri Shankar, Under Secretary, Central Board of Revenue, quoted above, and come to its own conclusion as to the bona fides of the order and if it is not satisfied that the order was made by the authorities in bona fide exercise of the power vested in them under section 5(7A) of the Act, it will certainly quash the lame.\r\n(3) I.L.R. 1952 Cuttack 529, 573.260 record.\r\nThe observations of Fazl Ali, J., in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar, (supra), at pages 309 310 that the authority will say \" I am not to blame as I am acting under the Act \" will not necessarily save the order from being challenged because even though the authority purported to act under the Act its action will be subject to scrutiny in the manner indicated above and will be liable to be set aside if it was found to be mala fide or discriminatory qua the assessee.\r\nParticular stress is laid on behalf of the petitioners on the observations at page 277 of the majority judgment in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (supra), which in the context of the omnibus wholesale order in question emphasized the substantial discrimination to which the assessee there had been subjected as compared with other bidi merchants who were similarly situated.\r\nThe inconvenience and harassiment to which the assessee was thus put were considered to be violative of article 14 of the Constitution and it is urged that section 5 (7A) is unconstitutional in Boar as it is open to the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, to make an order of transfer subjecting the assessee to such inconvenience and harassment at their sweet will and pleasure.\r\nThis argument of inconvenience, however, is not conclusive.\r\nThere is no fundamental right in an assessee to be assessed in a particular area or locality.\r\nEven considered in the context of section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act this right which is conferred upon the assessee to be assessed in a particular area or locality is not an absolute right but is subject to the exigencies of tax collection.\r\nThe difference, if any, created in the position of the assessee qua others who continue to be assessed by the Income tax Officer of the area in which they reside or carry on business is not a material difference but a minor deviation from the general standard and would, therefore, not amount to the denial of equal rights (Per Mukherjea, J., as he then was, in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar., (supra), at 261 p. 325)).\r\nThere is also the further fact to be borne mind that this inconvenience to the assessee is sough to be minimised by the authority concerned transferring the case of such assessee to the Income tax Officer who is nearest to the area where it would be convenient for the assessee to attend and if, on account of administrative exigencies, this is not possible an the assessee requests that the examination of account or evidence to be taken should be in a place convenient to him, by the Income tax Officer complying with the request of the assessee and holding the hearing at the place requested.\r\nWe are bound to take the statement contained in para 5 of the affidavit of Shri.V. Gouri Shankar at its face value and if this is done as it should be, the assessee will not be put to any inconvenience or harassment and the proper balance between the rights of the subject and public interest will be preserved.\r\nIt is, therefore, clear that the power which is veste in the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, under section 5 (7A) of the Act is not a naked and arbitrary power, unfettered, unguided or uncontrolled so as to enable the authority to pick and choose one assessee out of those similarly circumstanced thus subjecting him to discriminatory treatment as compared with others who fall within the same category.\r\nThe power is guided and controlled by the purpose which is to be achieved by the Act itself, viz., the charge of income tax, the assessment and collection thereof, and is to be exercised for the more convenient and efficient collection of the tax A wide discretion is given to the authorities concerned for the achievement of that purpose, in the matter of the transfer of the cases of the assessees from one Income tax Officer to another and it cannot be urged that such power which is vested in the authorities is discriminatory in its nature.\r\nThere is a broad distinction between discretion which has to be exercised with regard to a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and some other right which is given by the statute.\r\nIf the statute deals with a right which is not fundamental in character 262 the statute can take it away but a fundamental right the statute cannot take away.\r\nWhere, for example, a discretion is given in the matter of issuing licences for carrying on trade, profession or business or where restrictions are imposed on freedom of speech, etc., by a imposition of censorship, the discretion must be controlled by clear rules so as to come within the category of reasonable restrictions.\r\nDiscretion of that nature must be differentiated from discretion in respect of matters not involving fundamental rights such as transfers of cases.\r\nAn inconvenience resulting from a change of place or venue occurs when any case is transferred from one place to another but it is not open to a party to say that a fundamental right has been infringed by such transfer.\r\nIli other words, the discretion vested has to be looked at from two points of view, ViZ., (1) does it admit of the possibility of any real and substantial discrimination, and (2) does it impinge on a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution? Article 14 can be invoked only when both these conditions are satisfied.\r\nApplying this test, it is clear that the discretion which is vested in the Com missioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Reevenue, as the case may be, under section 5 (7A) is not at all discriminatory.\r\nIt follows, therefore, that section 5 (7A) of the Act is not violative of article 14 of the Constitution and also does not impose any unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or business enshrined in article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.\r\nIf there is any abuse of power it can be remedied by appropriate action either under article 226 or under article 32 of the constitution and what can be struck down is not the provision contained in section 5 (7A) of the Act but the order passed thereunder which may be mala fide or violative,of these fundamental rights.\r\nThis challenge of the vires of section 5 (7A) of the Act, therefore, fails.\r\nWe may, however, before we leave this topic observe that it would be prudent if the principles of natural justice are, followed, where circumstances permit, before any order of transfer under section 5 (7A) of the Act is made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the 263 Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, and notice is given to the party affected and he is afforded a reasonable opportunity of representing his views on the question and the reasons of the order are reduced however briefly to writing.\r\nIt is significant that when any question arises under section 64 as to the place of assessment and is determined by the Commissioner or Commissioners or by the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, the assessee is given an opportunity under section 64(3) of representing his views before any such question is determined.\r\nIf an opportunity is given to the assessee in such case, it is all the more ,surprising to find that, when an order of transfer under section 5(7A) is made transferring the case of the assessee from one Income tax 'Officer to another irrespective of the area or locality where he resides or carries on business, he should not be given such an opportunity.\r\nThere is no presumption against the bona fides or the honesty of an assessee and normally the Income tax authorities would not be justified in refusing to an assessee a reasonable opportunity of representing his views when any order to the prejudice of the normal procedure laid down in section 64 (1) and (2) of the Act is sought to be made against him, be it a transfer from one Income tax Officer to another within the State or from an Income tax Officer within the State to an Income tax Officer without it, except of course where the very object of the transfer would be frustrated if notice was given to the party affected.\r\nIf the reasons for making the order are reduced however briefly to writing it will also help the assessee in appreciating the circumstances which make it necessary or desirable for the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, to transfer his case under section 5(7A) of the Act and it will also help the court in determining the bona fides of the order as passed if and when the same is challenged in court as mala fide or discriminatory.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Income tax authorities will observe the above procedure wherever feasible.\r\nThe next point of attack is that the orders which Were made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the 264 Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, in these petitions are omnibus wholesale orders of transfer coming within the mischief of Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (supra), and are, therefore, hit by the majority judgment in that case.\r\nThe answer of the State is that the orders are valid by virtue of the explanation to section 5(7A) which was added by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act, 1956 (26 of 1956).\r\nThe main structure of section 5(7A) was, however, maintained and the explanation was added thereto in order to expand the connotation of the word \" case \" which was used in section 5(7A).\r\nThe manner in which this result was brought about is subject to criticism that the word ,case\" was thus really equated with the word \" file \" and when a case of a particular assessee was transferred under section 5(7A) it was meant that his whole file would be transferred from one Income tax Officer to another.\r\nThis inartistic mode appears, however to be adopted by the supposed necessity of maintaining section 5(7A) in the form in which it stood but what we have got to see is whether the desired result has been achieved by adding the explanation in the manner in which it was done.\r\nReading section 5(7A) and the explanation thereto, it is clear that when any case of a particular asssssee which is pending before an Income tax Officer is transferred from that officer to another Income tax Officer whether within the State or without it, all proceedings which are pending against him under the Act in respect of the same year as also previous years are meant to be transferred simultaneously and all proceedings under the 265 Act which may be commenced after the date of such transfer in respect of any year whatever are also included therei in so that the Income tax Officer to whom such case is transferred would be in a position to continue the pending proceedings and also institute further proceedings against the assessee in respect of any year.\r\nThe proceedings pending at the date of transfer can be thus continued but in the case of such proceedings the provision in regard to the issue of notices contained in the main body of section 5(7A) would apply and it would not be necessary to reissue any notice already issued by the Income tax Officer from whom the case is transferred.\r\nThis provision applies to pending proceedings which have been transferred leaving unaffected the further proceedings which may be commenced against the assessee after the date of the transfer where fresh notices would have to be issued.\r\nIt is, however, contended that the cases of the assessee which have been already closed in the previous years cannot be reopened by the Income tax Officer to whom the case of the assessee is thus transferred and the words \" after the date of transfer in respect of any year \" occurring at the end of the explanation are sought to be construed to mean \" after the date of the transfer in respect of the year of transfer \" thus rendering it incompetent to the Income tax Officer to whom the case is transferred to institute further proceedings in respect of cases of the assessee which have been already closed before the date of transfer.\r\nThis contention is, in our opinion, unsound.\r\nThe words used are \" in respect of any year\" and not \" in respect of the year \".\r\nMoreover they are to be read with the preceding words \"may be commenced \" and not with the words \"after the date of transfer\".\r\nA proper reading of the explanation will be that the inclusive part thereof refers to all proceedings under the Act which may be commenced in respect of any year after the date of the transfer.\r\nThe date of the transfer has relation only to the particular year in which the case of the assessee is thus transferred and to attach the words \" in respect of any year \" to the words \" after 34 266 the date of transfer\" do not make any sense.\r\nThe words \" in respect of any year \" appropriately go with the words \" which may commenced\" and read in this juxtaposition render the inclusive part of the explanation susceptible of a proper meaning.\r\nThe language of the explanation read in the manner suggested above is thus sufficient to dispel this contention of the petitioners.\r\nit follows, therefore, that the omnibus wholesale orders of transfer made against the petitioners by the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, are saved by the explanation to section 5(7A) and are not unconstitutional and void: It remains now to consider whether the individual orders against the petitioners are discriminatory in fact or are mala fide and in abuse of the power vested in the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, under section 5(7A) of the Act.\r\nPetitions Nos.\r\n211 to 215 of 1956, i.e., the Shiram Jhabarmull group, may be dealt with in the first instance as they have a peculiar characteristic of their own.\r\nThe orders complained against in these petitions were all made by the Commissioner of Income tax Central, Calcutta, on July 27, 1946, and further proceedings were entertained against the petitioners by the Income tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta, immeasurable thereafter.\r\nAll these proceedings culminated in assessment orders and certificate proceedings under section 46(2) of the Act were also taken by the authorities against the petitioners for recovery of the tax so assessed before the advent of the Constitution.\r\nThe question, therefore, arises whether these orders of transfer can be challenged by the petitioners as unconstitutional and void.\r\nIt is settled that article 13 of the Constitution has no retrospective effect and if, therefore, any action was taken before the commencement of the Constitution in pursuance of the provisions of any law which was a valid law at the time when such action was taken, such action cannot be challenged and the law under 267 which such action was taken cannot be questioned as unconstitutional and void on the score of its infringing the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution (See Keshavan Madhava Menon vs The State of Bombay(1)).\r\nThe following observations of Das, J., as he then was, at p. 235 of that case, may be appropriately referred to in this context: \"As already explained, article 13(1) only has the effect of nullifying or rendering all inconsistent existing laws ineffectual or nugatory and devoid of any legal force or binding effect only with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights on and after the date of the commencement of the Constitution.\r\nIt has no retrospective effect and if, therefore, an act was done before the commencement of the Constitution in contravention of any law which, after the Constitution, becomes void with respect to the exercise of any of the fundamental rights, the inconsistent law is not wiped out so far as the past act is concerned, for, to say that it is, will be to give the law retrospective effect. .\r\nSo far as the past acts are concerned the law exists, notwithstanding that it does not exist with respect to the future exercise of fundamental rights.\" (See also Syed Qasim Razvi vs The State of Hyderabad(2) and Laxmanappa Hanumanthappa Jamkhandi vs Union of India(1)).\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that the petitioners are not entitled to complain against the said orders of transfer dated July 27, 1946.\r\n225 to 229 of 1956, i.e., the Raichur group, and Petitions Nos. 86, 87, 88, 111, 112 and 158 of 1956, i.e., the Amritsar group, all belong to the same category.\r\nIn the first group, there was an order of transfer on December 21, 1953, passed by the Commissioner of Income tax, Hyderabad, transferring the cases of the petitioner from the Additional Income tax Officer, Raichur, to the Income tax, Officer, Special Circle, Hyderabad.\r\nThere was, however, an order passed by the Commissioner shortly before May 19, 1955, transferring the cases of the petitioner from the Income tax (1) ; , 235.\r\n(2) (3) ; 268 Officer, Special Circle, Hyderabad, to the main Income tax Officer, Raichur.\r\nThe petitioner thus reverted to the Income tax Officer, Raichur, and it passes one 's imagination what possible argument he can urge on the score of inconvenience and harassment.\r\nThe whole attitude of the petitioner is motivated by an intention to delay the payment of income tax legitimately due by him to the Revenue trying to take advantage of a mere technicality.\r\nIn the second group, there were orders passed by the Commissioner of Income tax transferring the cases of the petitioners from the Income tax Officer, \"AWard, Amritsar, or the Income tax Officer, 'F 'Ward, Amritsar, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Amritsar.\r\nBoth these officers were situated in the same building and under the same roof.\r\nThe argument of inconvenience and harassment can, under these circumstances, be hardly advanced by them.\r\nThere is moreover another feature which is common to both these groups and it is that none of the petitioners raised any objection to their cases being transferred in the manner stated above and in fact submitted to the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officers to whom their cases had been transferred.\r\nIt was only after our decision in Bidi Supply Co. vs The Union of India, (supra), was pronounced on March 20, 1956, that these petitioners woke up and asserted their alleged rights, the Amritsar group on April 20, 1956, and the Raichur group on November 5, 1956.\r\nIf they acquiesced in the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officers to whom their cases were transferred, they were certainly not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under article 32.\r\nIt is well settled that such conduct of the petitioners would disentitle them to any relief at the hands of this Court (Vide Halsbury 's Laws of England ', Vol.\r\nII, 3rd Ed., p. 140, para 265; Rex vs Tabrum, Ex Parte Dash(1); 0. A. 0.\r\nK. Lakshmanan Chettiar vs Commissioner, Corporation of Madras and Chief Judge,Court of Small Causes, Madras(2) ).\r\nThe orders of transfer made by the Commissioner of Income tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the (1) (2) [1927] 1.\r\nL. R. 269 case may be, against the three groups of petitioners, viz., Sriram Jhabarmull group, the Raichur group and the Amritsar group, cannot, therefore, be challenged by them as unconstitutional and void This leaves two sets of petitioners, the petitioners in Petitions Nos.\r\n97 & 97 A of 1956 and the petitioners in Petitions Nos.\r\n44\/56 and 85\/56.\r\nPetitions Nos.\r\n97 & 97 A of 1956 : The petitioners are oilmill owners, merchants and commission agents, carrying on business at Sahibganj in the district of Santhal Parganas and have a branch at 97, Lower Chitpur Road, Calcutta.\r\nThey were alleged to have concealed income exceeding Rs. 8 lakhs and indulged in business activities spread over a wide area resulting in large profits not disclosed in the books of account or in the various returns filed by them.\r\nAfter the judgment of this Court in Surajmull Mohta & Co. vs A. V. Viswanatha Sastri(2), about 320 cases referred to the Income tax Investigation Commission under section 5 (4) of Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act (XXX of 1947) were affected and had to be reopened under section 34 (IA) of the Income tax Act.\r\nTo dispose of these cases, \"since they involved many back years ' cases\" quickly and promptly, special circles without reference to area were created at Bombay and Calcutta, because the existing circles, whose hands were full, could not take up this extra work.\r\nThese 320 cases were distributed between these circles on the basis of the geographical area to which these assessees belonged.\r\nThe petitioners belonged to Bihar and had a branch at Calcutta and their cases were, therefore, allotted to one of the Central Circles at Calcutta.\r\nLater on in October 1954, this Court struck down section 5 (1) of the Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act (XXX of 1947) in Meenakshi Mills Ltd. vs Viswanatha Sastri.\r\n(2 ) and as a result thereof cases referred under that section and pending with the (I) [1055] 1 S.C. R. 448.\r\n(2) [1955] I S.C. R. 787.\r\n270 Income tax Investigation Commission on July 17,1954, could not be preceded with under the provisions of that Act.\r\nThese cases numbering about 470 had to be reopened under section 34 (1A) of the Income tax Act.\r\nThe Government thought that as in the earlier lot of cases, it would help speedier disposal of the cases, if they were allotted to Income tax Officers appointed without reference to area to deal with the same.\r\nIn addition to the circles already created in Bombay and Calcutta, five more circles at Calcutta and 4 more circles at Bombay and 9 more circles at important centers such as Kanpur, Ahmedabad, Madras and Delhi were set up to deal with all these cases.\r\nAs a result of the influx of these cases, it was found that the 9 circles at Calcutta had about 280 cases of assessees belonging to Calcutta itself to dispose of and therefore cases not belonging to that area had to be taken out and assigned to one of the newly created circles, Where the work load was low.\r\nIt was found then that Central Circle VI had a lower work load compared to other circles and, therefore, the cases of the petitioners were transferred to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle VI, Delhi.\r\nHaving regard to these circumstances which are disclosed in the affidavits of Shri V. Gouri Shankar, Under Secretary, Central Board of Revenue, dated November 19, 1956, and December 3, 1956, it is clear that the transfer of the cases of the petitioners, firstly, from the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Patna, to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle XI, Calcutta, and next, from the latter officer to the Income tax Officer, Central Circle VI, Delhi, were made as a matter of administrative convenience only.\r\nIt further appear; from the said affidavits that the examination of accounts and the evidence was done at the places desired by the assessees in order to suit their convenience and the Income tax Officers were instructed accordingly.\r\nAs a matter of fact the Income tax Officer, Central Circle VI, Delhi, went to Sahibganj and examined the accounts there in the case of the petitioner No. 1 and when the assessee voluntarily requested the Income tax Officer to have 271 the examination done at Delhi (the assessee had then come to Delhi for some other work of his) the Income tax Officer promptly posted the case and examined the accounts.\r\nIf these were the circumstances under which the cases of the petitioners were transferred from Patna to Calcutta and from Calcutta to Delhi and the petitioners were afforded all conveniences in the matter of the examination of their accounts and evidence, there is no basis for the charge that the orders of transfer made against these petitioners were in any manner whatever discriminatory.\r\nPetitions Nos. 44 and 85 of 1956 The petitioner in Petition No. 44\/56 is Shri A. L. Sud who originally belonged to Hoshiarpur district in Punjab and since 1948 resides and has his office in Calcutta.\r\nBhagwan Das Sud as the karta thereof.\r\nThis Hindu undivided family has been carrying on business at Hoshiarpur and at various other places like Bareilly, Calcutta and Bombay.\r\nThe said joint family of Bhagwan Das Sud & Sons was alleged to have evaded income tax to a large extent and had inter related transactions in respect of their dealings, the petitioner being a copartner of the said joint family.\r\nIt was, therefore, considered necessary in order to have a proper assessment of the petitioner 's income that his case also should be dealt with by the Income tax Officer assessing the joint family and the petitioner was informed that, in the matter of hearing, he would be put to least inconvenience.\r\nThese were the circumstances under which his case was transferred from the Income tax Officer, Survey Circle, Calcutta, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, by an order of the Central Board of Revenue dated June 29, 1955.\r\nThe case of M\/S. Bhagwan Das Sud & Sons, petitioners in Petition No. 85\/56; had already been 272 transferred by the Commissioner of Income tax from the Income tax Officer, Hoshiarpur, to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, by an order under section 5(7A) of the Act dated October 20, 1953.\r\nThe petitioners had their office at Hoshiarpur in Punjab but their activities were scattered in various parts of India some of them being in Assam, Bombay, Bareilly, Calcutta and Kanpur in respect of the contracts they undertook with the Government and other parties.\r\nThey were alleged to have concealed income assessable to income tax exceeding Rs. 30 lakhs and it was thought necessary to make proper investigation of their widespread activities resulting ' in extensive evasion of income tax.\r\nThese were the circumstances under which their case was transferred to the Incometax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, as above.\r\nThat officer, however, agreed to examine the accounts and evidence at Hoshiarpur itself to suit the convenience of the petitioners but the petitioners did not agree on the ground that their Advocate was to come from Delhi and therefore Ambala would suit them as well.\r\nThe cases of both the petitioners thus came to be transferred from the respective Income tax Officers who used to assess them at Calcutta and Hoshiarpur respectively to the Income tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala, and all conveniences were afforded to them in the matter of the examination of their accounts and evidence.\r\nThe argument of discrimination and inconvenience and harassment thus loses all its force and the orders of transfer made against them cannot be challenged as in any way discriminatory.\r\nIt may be noted that in the last mentioned four petitions, viz., Petitions Nos. 97 & 97 A of 1956 and Petitions Nos.\r\n44\/56 and 85\/56, the Central Board of Revenue or the Commissioner of Income tax, as the case may be, instructed the Income tax Officers concerned to minimise the inconvenience caused to the assessees and even proceed to their respective residences or places of business in order to examine the accounts and evidence.\r\nInspite of the denials of the assessees in the affidavits which they filed in 273 rejoinder, we presume that such facilities will continue to be afforded to them in the future and the inconvenience and harassment which would otherwise be caused to them will be avoided.\r\nA humane and considerate administration of the relevant provisions of the Income tax Act would go a long way in allaying the apprehensions of the assessees and if that is done in the true spirit, no assessee will be in a position to charge the Revenue with administering the provisions of the Act with \" an evil eye and unequal hand \".\r\nWe have, therefore, come to the conclusion that there is no substance in these petitions and they should be dismissed with costs.\r\nThere will, be, however, one set of costs between respondents in each of the petitions and one set of costs in each group of these petitions, viz., (1) Petitions Nos.97 & 97 A of 1956, (2) Petitions Nos.44\/56 and 85\/56, (3) Petitions Nos. 86\/56, 87\/56, 88\/56, 111\/56, 112\/56 and 158\/56, (4) Petitions Nos.211 to 215 of 1956, and (5) Petitions Nos. 225 to 229 of 1956.",
